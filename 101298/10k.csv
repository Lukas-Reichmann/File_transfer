Business As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” “CleanSpark, Inc.” and “CleanSpark” mean CleanSpark, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. Dollar amounts presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in thousands, except per share amounts, bitcoin price, and information set forth under the heading “Bitcoin Mining Operations”. Overview CleanSpark is a bitcoin mining company. We independently own and operate five data centers in Georgia for a total developed capacity of 230 megawatts (“MW”). We are developing an additional 150 MW at our data center in Sandersville, GA, which is expected to energize in early 2024. We do not currently host miners for any other companies. A partner in Massena, NY, hosts 50 MW for us. We design our proprietary infrastructure to responsibly support bitcoin, the world’s most important digital commodity and an essential tool for financial independence and inclusion. Through CleanSpark and our wholly owned subsidiaries, we have operated in the bitcoin mining sector since December 2020. From March 2014 to June 30, 2022, we provided advanced energy technology solutions to commercial and residential customers to solve modern energy challenges in the alternative energy sector. As of June 30, 2022, we discontinued our energy operations due to our strategic decision to strictly focus on our bitcoin mining operations. Business Activity Bitcoin mining is our principal revenue generating business activity. As of September 30, 2023, we operated 88,954 bitcoin mining machines, with a hashrate capacity of approximately 9.6 exahashes per second (“EH/s”) and a fleetwide efficiency of 28.4 joules per terahash (“J/TH”). In fiscal year 2023, we mined 6,903 bitcoins, an 84% increase over the 3,752 bitcoins we mined in fiscal year 2022. We expect to continue increasing our computing power through 2024 and beyond as we expand our infrastructure at our owned sites in the State of Georgia, seek strategic acquisition targets, and through strategic co-location agreements. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the goal of serving as a digital means of exchanging and storing value. Bitcoin depends on a consensus-based network and a public ledger called a “blockchain,” which contains a record of every bitcoin transaction ever processed. The bitcoin network is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network powered by users participating in the consensus protocol, with no central authority or intermediaries, that has wide network participation. The authenticity of each bitcoin transaction is protected through digital signatures that correspond with addresses of users that send and receive bitcoin. Users have full control over remitting bitcoin from their own sending addresses. All transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are transparent, allowing those running the appropriate software to confirm the validity of each transaction. To be recorded on the blockchain, each bitcoin transaction is broadcast across the network and validated by nodes. Miners then compete, using a proof-of-work consensus method, to find a target hash value, or output of a cryptographic function, and thereby add a new block and its transactions to the blockchain. This process is called mining. Miners are rewarded with bitcoins, in the form of newly-created bitcoins from the block subsidy and transaction fees included in that block. Factors such as access to computer processing capacity, interconnectivity, electricity cost, environmental factors (such as cooling capacity) and location play important roles in mining. In bitcoin mining, “hashrate” is a measure of the computing and processing power and speed by which a mining computer mines and processes transactions on the bitcoin network. A company’s hashrate determines its market share and is therefore generally considered one of the most important metrics for evaluating bitcoin mining companies. We obtain bitcoin as a result of our mining operations by contributing all of our computing power (both owned locations and hosted locations) to one mining pool operator who is our sole customer. The contract with our mining pool operator is terminable at any time by either party. In exchange for providing computing power to the mining pool, we are entitled to bitcoin rewards from the mining pool operator, which is a variable consideration calculated based on a predetermined formula agreed to by us and the mining pool operator as a part of the arrangement. The variable consideration is constrained until we can reasonably estimate the amount of mining rewards by the end of a 6 given day based on the actual amount of computing power provided to the mining pool operator. By then, we consider it a high probability that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue will not occur and include such variable consideration in the transaction price. Providing computing power is an output of our ordinary activities and the only performance obligation in our contracts with our mining pool operator. We recognize the revenue when the variable consideration is no longer constrained and the performance obligation of providing computing power has been satisfied. As a result, we do not present disaggregated revenue information on block rewards and transaction verification fees. We sell bitcoin from time to time, to support our operations and strategic growth. We do not currently plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin (other than as necessary to convert our bitcoin to U.S. dollars) or to engage in hedging activities related to our holding of bitcoin; however, our decisions to hold or sell bitcoin at any given time may be impacted by the bitcoin market, which has been historically characterized by significant volatility. Decisions to hold or sell bitcoins are determined by management by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries CSRE Properties, LLC, CSRE Property Management Company, LLC, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, CSRE Properties Washington, LLC, CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC, CSRE Properties Dalton, LLC, and CleanSpark HQ, LLC, we maintain real property holdings. Markets, Geography and Major Customers Bitcoin is a global store and exchange of value used by people across the world as an asset and to conduct daily transactions. Mining bitcoin supports the global bitcoin blockchain and the millions of people that depend on it for economic security and other benefits. Strictly speaking, there is no customer market for mining bitcoin but we consider our mining pool operator a customer because it compensates us for providing processing power to the mining pool (see Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors”—“Our reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may adversely affect an investment in us . ”). We own and operate our own facilities and do not lease mining space to other mining companies or private individuals that mine. Our wholly-owned mining operations are located in the State of Georgia in the United States. We also have a relationship with a facility located in New York State that hosts a portion of our miners. College Park, GA Facility CleanSpark’s first ever bitcoin mining facility is in College Park, GA. It sits on six acres near the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and features at its heart 48 new generation air-cooled pods. Machines are also housed in 20 Ant boxes, an annex building and within the original data center. As of September 30, 2023, the facility maintained an operational hashrate of 1.7 EH/s. Norcross, GA Facility An 87,000-square-foot data center in Norcross, GA was purchased and transformed into CleanSpark’s second bitcoin mining facility. Situated on over seven acres, the immersion-cooled site participates in Georgia’s Flex REC program and is 100% net carbon-neutral. There are two large rooms that house 20 MW of single-phase immersion—about 4,300 machines. Liquid immersion cooling, where bitcoin mining machines are fully immersed in a specialized oil, has proven to significantly improve efficiency by reducing power consumption and extending the life of the machines—thereby maximizing financial gains. As of September, 30, 2023, the facility maintained an operational hashrate of 0.5 EH/s. Washington, GA Facility Nestled between Augusta and Athens, the historic town of Washington is home to CleanSpark’s third bitcoin mining facility. It was purchased during the summer 2022 bear market from another bitcoin miner as an already-operational site. Bitcoin mining machines are set up in multiple air-cooled buildings. A completed 50 MW expansion in July 2023 created four more buildings filled with an additional 14,000 latest-generation miners. It draws power predominantly from low-carbon sources, such as nuclear energy. As of September 30, 2023, the facility maintained an operational hashrate of 3.0 EH/s. Sandersville, GA Facility 7 CleanSpark’s fourth bitcoin mining site (and second to be purchased during the summer 2022 bear market) is the largest facility in our portfolio. The turnkey operation in Sandersville, GA was acquired from another bitcoin miner with room to almost triple its capacity. The site is undergoing a 150 MW expansion with expected completion early in our second fiscal quarter ending March 2024. Each building will house thousands of high-performance bitcoin mining machines and, once completed, will add over 6.0 EH/s to our hashrate. As of September 30, 2023, the facility maintained an operational hashrate of 2.1 EH/s. Dalton, GA Facility Dalton marks CleanSpark’s fifth campus in Georgia. It collaborates closely with the local utility, which is owned and operated by the City of Dalton. This campus is made of two separate sites a few miles from each other. As of September 30, 2023, the facility maintained an operational hashrate of 0.8 EH/s. Massena, NY Hosting Site We also co-locate some of our machines at the facilities of Coinmint, LLC (""Coinmint"") in Massena, NY. The facility runs on hydroelectric power. As of September 30, 2023, our machines there maintained an operational hashrate of 1.5 EH/s. Working Capital Items The bitcoin mining industry is highly competitive and dependent on specialized mining machines that have few manufacturers. Machine purchases often require large down payments and miner deliveries often arrive many months after initial orders are placed. However, over the last 12 months, we have seen a significant improvement in the availability and pricing of bitcoin mining machines. In addition to purchasing directly from manufacturers, the current market conditions have provided opportunities to purchase both new and used machines on the spot-market from other miners or retail-dealers of machines for better financial terms and delivery terms, but there can be no guarantee that such opportunities will continue on a long-term basis. We purchase mining machines through re-sellers and directly from manufacturers. Whether re-sellers or manufacturers have better purchase and delivery terms or more/superior inventory available is likely to change from time to time. In addition to the approximate 88,000 miners (application-specific integrated circuits or “ASIC”) in operation as of the date of this filing, the Company has received, and will be installing in the coming months approximately 45,000 more miners in our soon-to-be-completed 150 MW expansion of our Sandersville location. The Company entered into an additional agreement to purchase 4.4 EH/s of S21 miners in October 2023 and is scheduled to receive these miners beginning in January 2024. Most miners we operate and expect to operate once received are the latest generation of miners manufactured by Bitmain Technologies Ltd. (“Bitmain”), including the S19-Pro, S19j-Pro, S19j-Pro+, S19 XP and S21. Distribution, Marketing and Strategic Relationships We have developed strategic relationships with well-established companies in key areas, including utilities, traditional and renewable energy, infrastructure, construction, and bitcoin mining equipment procurement. In addition to operating our own mining facilities, we may engage with third-parties to host and operate mining equipment on our behalf. Coinmint On July 8, 2021, our subsidiary CleanBlok, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (""CleanBlok""), entered into a services agreement with Coinmint. Pursuant to the agreement, Coinmint has agreed to house and power certain of our bitcoin mining equipment in its facilities, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to mine bitcoin on our behalf. All bitcoin mining services performed by Coinmint are conducted using our own mining equipment. All computing power generated by our ASICs is contributed to our mining pool operator, Foundry Digital. As of the date of this filing, we have deployed approximately 16,400 total miners pursuant to the co-location mining services agreement at Coinmint’s facility in New York. 8 Pursuant to the agreement, as consideration for its services, we pay Coinmint certain services fees, which are based on the operating costs incurred by Coinmint in performing its services, and a variable fee calculated based on the profitability of the bitcoin mined during the relevant payment period, subject to uptime performance commitments. The agreement had an initial term of one year, after which it renews automatically for three-month periods until terminated in accordance with its terms. Materials and Suppliers We engage in high efficiency bitcoin mining by using ASICs. These specialized computers, often called mining rigs, have few manufacturers. Most of the machines we purchased this year were manufactured by Bitmain, one of the top three preeminent manufacturers of bitcoin mining rigs. Bitmain manufactures ASICs throughout Asia, and is headquartered in China with subsidiaries in the United States, Singapore, Malaysia, Kazakhstan and other locations. In addition to ASICs, mining equipment includes networking equipment, power cords, racking, other specialized equipment, transformers and energy equipment. We rely on utility providers for our power needs. These utilities buy into local energy mixes to source power. We make every effort to establish our facilities in locations serviced by utilities that source a substantial portion of their energy from clean and renewable sources. We supplement a portion of the energy mix provided by our utility providers by purchasing renewable energy credits as the precise ratio of renewable energy in local energy mixes is not within our control. We have exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices through our power providers. We actively manage these risks through activities such as the deployment of advanced software solutions to increase unit efficiency and energy curtailment when appropriate. These energy market prices may be significantly impacted by market conditions and geopolitical events. Historically, our methodology and operations have been efficient and resilient enough to withstand market pressures and global events, but there can be no certainty that we will not be negatively affected in the future. While some macro-economic indicators available as of the date of this filing suggest that inflation may be slowing, inflationary pressures impact virtually all aspects of our materials and suppliers, including power prices, and are likely to impact our fiscal year 2024. Environmental Issues No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from our direct operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not historically been material. Starting in the fourth calendar quarter of 2021, we began to voluntarily purchase renewable energy credits to offset a portion of our energy consumption that is derived from non-renewable sources. We have engaged market professionals to enhance and build a comprehensive corporate social responsibility strategy, which we began executing in 2023. Some policymakers have expressed concerns over the high energy consumption of data centers, including bitcoin miners, and the ancillary effects on the environment from that energy consumption. Many media reports focus exclusively on the energy requirements of bitcoin mining and cite it as an environmental concern. We carefully monitor existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation, and international treaties or accords for any material effect on our business or markets that we serve, our operational results, our capital expenditures or our financial position. The table below describes the energy sources of our electricity use for each of our owned locations as of September 30, 2023, as reported to us by our power providers. Percentage of energy usage by each owned location (4) College Park, GA (3) Norcross, GA (3) Washington, GA Sandersville, GA Dalton, GA Non-Carbon (1) 88.0 % 100.0 % 68.4 % 63.5 % 21.0 % Carbon (2) 12.0 % 0.0 % 31.6 % 36.5 % 79.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % (1) Non-carbon usage includes hydro, nuclear, wind and solar (2) Carbon usage includes coal and natural gas 9 (3) Norcross and College Park are offset by renewable energy credit purchases (4) Energy reported by grid operators as uncategorized is excluded from the percentages above We purchase energy from the electrical grid, and as a result our energy mix will vary from period to period based on a variety of factors including weather, temperature, demand, and how the grid operator ultimately procures and utilizes energy resources. The table breaks out energy sources as reported to the Company by the grid operators. Competition Bitcoin mining is a global activity. During fiscal year 2021, a majority of bitcoin mining occurred in China. After China banned bitcoin mining in May 2021, the center of mining moved to North America. Bitcoin mining by its nature is a competitive business; all miners compete for the same number of bitcoin rewards. Our competitors include large, publicly listed mining companies, large private mining companies, and, in some cases, independent, individual miners who pool resources. We define our principal competitors as other publicly traded bitcoin miners because there is widely available information about their operations. We believe our principal competitive advantages include our energy background, a combination of owned, operated, and co-located miners and facilities, our strategic use of the bitcoin we mine to fund operational growth and our commitment to responsible business practices, including building in communities that source renewable energy. Within North America, our major competitors include: In addition to the foregoing, we compete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on mining activities at scale. We face significant competition in certain operational aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, obtaining low-cost electricity, obtaining clean energy sources, obtaining access to energy sites with reliable sources of power and evaluating new technology developments in the industry. Intellectual Property We do not currently own any patents in connection with our existing and planned bitcoin mining-related operations. We do rely, and expect to continue relying, upon trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Government Regulation Bitcoin mining is largely an unregulated activity at both the state and federal level. We anticipate that bitcoin mining will be a focus for increased regulation in the near- and long-term, and we cannot predict how future regulations may affect our business or operations. State regulation of bitcoin mining is important with respect to where we conduct our mining operations. The majority of our mining facilities are located in Georgia, which is one of the most favorable regulatory environments for bitcoin miners. However, we also have co-location operations in New York, which has generally been more aggressive in its regulation of bitcoin mining. Current New York regulation, including a recent moratorium on certain bitcoin mining operations that run on carbon-based power sources signed into law on November 22, 2022, in our view, does not impact our decision to operate our miners at the Coinmint facility in New York in the foreseeable future; however, if the regulatory landscape changes, we would evaluate whether to relocate our hosted miners to one of our facilities in Georgia or to other facilities outside of New York State, which could be costly and cause us to not be able to operate the miners while they are being relocated. 10 Further, in March 2022, the United States announced plans to establish a unified federal regulatory regime for cryptocurrency, and a group of United States Senators sent a letter to the United States Treasury Department (the “Treasury”) asking Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to investigate the Treasury’s ability to monitor and restrict the use of cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions imposed by the United States. We are unable to predict the impact that any new regulations may have on our business at the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In August 2021, the chair of the SEC stated that he believed investors using digital asset trading platforms are not adequately protected, and that activities on the platforms can implicate the securities laws, commodities laws and banking laws, raising a number of issues related to protecting investors and consumers, guarding against illicit activity, and ensuring financial stability. The chair expressed a need for the SEC to have additional authority to prevent transactions, products, and platforms from “falling between regulatory cracks,” as well as for more resources to protect investors in “this growing and volatile sector.” The chair called for federal legislation centering on digital asset trading, lending, and decentralized finance platforms, seeking “additional plenary authority” to write rules for digital asset trading and lending. Since that time, Congress has considered a number of legislative proposals for regulating the digital asset industry. We continue to monitor and proactively engage in dialogue on legislative matters related to our industry. In addition, federal regulators have increased their enforcement activity in the digital asset industry. Federal agencies such as the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) have brought a number of enforcement actions, including actions against significant players in the industry. In fiscal year 2023, for example, the CFTC brought 47 actions involving conduct related to digital asset commodities, representing more than 49 percent of all actions filed by the CFTC during that time period. This increased enforcement by agencies like the SEC and CFTC has resulted in part from the failure of FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”) in November 2022 and the resulting market turmoil that failure caused. While these statements tend to focus more on digital asset exchanges and other players in the digital asset space and less on bitcoin miners, the failure of large exchanges may impact the adoption and value of bitcoin. Additionally, because we sell our bitcoin on exchanges, we may also be potentially impacted by exchange failures in that respect. For those reasons, we carefully vet the exchanges we use for adequate compliance with U.S. laws as well as liquidity, using the information available to us, but we cannot be certain that we will be able to avoid the negative effects of a large exchange failure. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, such as further regulation by the SEC, CFTC and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” beginning on page 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Cybersecurity Our share of bitcoins mined from our pool are initially received by us in wallets we control, which are maintained by Coinbase Inc. (“Coinbase”), a U.S.-based digital assets exchange. We sell portions of the bitcoin we mine and utilize hot wallets to hold this bitcoin immediately prior to selling for working capital purposes. We hold any remainder of our bitcoin in cold storage. Bitcoin in cold wallets are reconciled monthly and are considered “on-chain.” In other words, the cold wallets have a unique blockchain address and their activity is tracked through the blockchain by the Company if there are any reconciling issues. For security reasons, Coinbase does not disclose the geographic location of its cold storage wallets to its customers. Our custody agreement with Coinbase provides that Coinbase will obtain and maintain at its sole expense insurance coverage in such types and amounts as are commercially reasonable for the custodial services provided under the custody agreement. We do not carry additional insurance coverage on our bitcoin holdings. Further we are not aware of any insurance providers or other third parties (e.g. auditors) having inspection or other verification rights associated with digital assets held in storage. We recognize the importance of assessing, identifying and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. Bitcoins we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access. Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure bitcoins, such as by attacking the bitcoin network source code, exchange miners, third-party platforms (including Coinbase), cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of substantial holdings of bitcoin, and as we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of 11 hackers, malware, cyberattacks or other security threats. We have an established IT Steering Committee, formed of senior Company leadership, which evaluates all cybersecurity matters, with the purpose of meeting at least semi-annually and providing recommendations with respect to our information technology use and protection, including, but not limited to, data governance, privacy, compliance and cybersecurity. We have implemented controls, policies, procedures and technological safeguards to maintain and protect the integrity, continuous operation, redundancy and security of our IT systems and data that we believe to be reasonably consistent with industry standards and practices, or as required by applicable regulatory standards. We are also required to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and contractual obligations relating to the privacy and security of our IT systems and data and to the protection of such IT systems and data from unauthorized use, access, misappropriation or modification. Insurance We have property insurance coverage for our bitcoin miners under a multi-tiered insurance program with 18 different underwriters for a total of $100,000 in limits. This insurance coverage covers all the Company’s bitcoin miners and includes Earthquake/Flood insurance with a $5,000 limit and Storm/Wind/Hail coverage with a limit of 3% Value at Risk of Time of Loss. We also maintain equipment breakdown coverage, with a property damage limit of $100,000. We do not maintain Business Interruption Coverage, which is currently not being provided by underwriters to any bitcoin mining companies. The policies also exclude coverage of our bitcoin holdings and cybersecurity coverage. We engage our insurance broker annually to solicit underwriters to provide proposals to renew our current coverage or update our policies to meet our needs, prior to the policies’ expiration on November 1st of each year. Human Resources We believe that our future success depends, in no small part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. As of September 30, 2023, we had 131 staff members, all located in the United States, and 130 of which were full time. We believe that we have adequate personnel and resources with the specialized skills required to carry out our operations successfully. Employees participate in equity incentive plans and receive generous compensation in the form of salary and benefits. We continually seek to hire and retain talented professionals, although the competition for such personnel in our segments is significant. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have a strong and engaging relationship with our employees. We cultivate trust and transparency among our employees, the communities we operate in, and the people around the world who depend on bitcoin as we jointly strive to build the infrastructure of the future. Discontinued Operations As of June 30, 2022, we deemed our energy operations to be discontinued operations due to our strategic decision to strictly focus on bitcoin mining operations and to divest or dispose of the remaining energy assets. Through our discontinued operations segment, we previously provided energy solutions through our wholly owned subsidiaries CleanSpark LLC, CleanSpark II, LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc., GridFabric, LLC, and ATL Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. We have since sold or disposed of the majority of our software and intellectual property assets related to the Energy Segment (including mPulse, mVoult and GridFabric LLC) and sold all additional inventory and other assets. Other Business Activities Through our wholly owned subsidiary ATL Data Centers LLC (""ATL""), we previously provided traditional data center services to a small number of remaining clients, such as providing customers with rack space, power and equipment, and offered several cloud services including virtual services, virtual storage, and data backup services. As of September 30, 2023, ATL no longer provides data center services to external customers and all capacity of the location is now dedicated to bitcoin mining activities. 12 Company Information CleanSpark, Inc. was incorporated in 1987 and is headquartered in Henderson, Nevada.

Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves risk. In evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Risk Factors Summary Below is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below and should be carefully considered, together with other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Risks Related to Our Business 13 14 Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Enforcement Operations Risks Related to Our Securities Risks Related to Our Business Our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on the price of bitcoin, which has historically been volatile. Our primary focus on our bitcoin mining operations and our associated expansion efforts is largely based on our assumptions regarding the future value of bitcoin, which has been subject to significant historical volatility and may be subject to influence from malicious actors, real or perceived scarcity, political, economic, and regulatory conditions, and speculation making its price more volatile. 15 It is difficult to accurately predict the future market price of bitcoin, which may inhibit consumer trust in and market acceptance of bitcoin as a means of exchange, thereby potentially limiting the future adoption of bitcoin and resulting in our assumptions proving to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove incorrect and the future price of bitcoin is not sufficiently high, our income from our bitcoin mining operations may not exceed our costs, and our operations may never achieve profitability. We have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses and negative cash flow, and we may never achieve consistent profitability. Our limited operating history, in particular our recent entry into the bitcoin mining business, makes it difficult to evaluate our business and predict our future results of operations. Although we have achieved profitable quarters in the past, to date, we have not maintained consistent profitability from period to period, and no assurances can be made that we will achieve consistent profitability in the near future, if ever. From the Company’s inception through September 30, 2023, we sustained $332,643 in cumulative net losses, and we had a net loss from our continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 of $132,160. We have generated these losses as we execute our business plan and expand on our bitcoin mining activities as bitcoin prices have at times been in a bear market. The extent to which we will continue to recognize losses in our continuing operations is dependent on bitcoin prices, among other factors. Our future success is difficult to predict because we operate in emerging and evolving industries that are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles. The bitcoin mining and related industries are emerging and evolving, which may lead to period-to-period variability in our operating results and may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned within a business cycle, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may be unable to successfully compete. We compete in the highly competitive market for certain operational aspects of our bitcoin mining business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, obtaining the lowest cost of electricity, obtaining clean energy sources, obtaining access to energy sites with reliable sources of power and evaluating new technology developments in the industry. Evolving industry standards, rapid price changes and product obsolescence impact the market and its various participants, including us. Our competitors include many domestic and foreign companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage. The success of our bitcoin mining business will be dependent upon our ability to purchase additional miners, adapt to changes in technology in the industry, and to obtain sufficient energy at reasonable prices, amongst other things. A significant part of our success will depend on our reliance on and ability to manage our construction contractors and suppliers, including mining equipment suppliers, in order to meet our expansion efforts in keeping with planned timelines and cost estimates, and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for the purchase and delivery of our miners to support our bitcoin mining operations. There can be no assurance that such key suppliers and manufacturers will provide components, products or miners in a timely and cost-efficient manner or otherwise meet our needs and expectations. Any disruption in the operations of such key suppliers or manufacturers could delay our ability to expand our bitcoin mining operations. Our ability to manage such relationships and timely replace suppliers and manufacturers, if necessary, is critical to our success. Our failure to timely replace our manufacturers and suppliers, should that become necessary, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. For example, we depend on Bitmain, MicroBT, Canaan Crypt Solutions and Sunnyside Digital for our mining rigs and any change in their ability to manufacture or distribute and deliver these products could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Supply chain disruptions resulting from factors such as inflation, labor supply and shipping container shortages and the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted, and may continue to impact, us and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers. We are reliant on third parties for our expansion efforts, including construction contractors and suppliers of infrastructure, to provide accurate 16 estimates and timelines. If those parties experience delays, cannot access adequate capital, or are exposed to inflation pressures or supply chain disruptions, our expansion efforts will be similarly impacted. We rely heavily on our management team, whose continued service and performance is critical to our future success. Any failure by management to properly manage growth, including hiring and retaining competent and skilled management and other personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We currently have three executive officers — our Chief Executive Officer and President, Zachary Bradford, our Chief Financial Officer, Gary Vecchiarelli, and S. Matthew Schultz, our Executive Chairman — who are responsible for our management functions and are responsible for strategic development, financing and other critical functions. Our future success depends significantly on the continued service and performance of our existing management team. The departure, death, disability or other extended loss of services of any member of our management team, particularly with little or no notice, could cause delays on projects, frustrate our growth prospects and could have an adverse impact on our industry relationships, our project exploration and development programs, other aspects of our business and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects. Our success, growth prospects and ability to capitalize on market opportunities also depend to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire, motivate and retain qualified managerial personnel, including additional senior members of management. Our growth may be constrained by resource limitations as competitors and customers compete for increasingly scarce human capital resources. The demand for professionals familiar with bitcoin mining and other skilled workers is currently high. Our competitors may be able to offer a work environment with higher compensation or more opportunities than we can. Any new personnel we hire may not be or become as productive as we expect, as we may face challenges in adequately or appropriately integrating them into our workforce and culture. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, our ability to successfully implement our business plan, grow our company and maintain or expand our mining operations may be adversely affected, and the costs of doing so may increase, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our planned expansion could also place significant demands on our management, operations, systems, accounting, internal controls and financial resources. If we experience difficulties in any of these areas, we may not be able to expand our business successfully or effectively manage our growth. Any failure by management to manage growth and to respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have engaged in, and in the future may engage in, strategic acquisitions and other arrangements that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders, reduce our financial resources and harm our operating results. We have previously engaged in strategic transactions, including acquisitions of companies, technologies and personnel, such as our recent asset and business acquisitions related to our Dalton, GA, Sandersville, GA and Washington, GA facilities, and, as part of our growth strategy, in the future, we may seek additional opportunities to grow our mining operations, including through purchases of miners and facilities from other operating companies, including companies in financial distress. Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend on the availability of, and our ability to identify, suitable acquisition and investment opportunities at an acceptable cost, our ability to compete effectively to attract those opportunities and the availability of financing to complete acquisitions. Future acquisitions may require us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership, assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company, record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses and become subject to litigation. The benefits of an acquisition may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition will produce the intended benefits in a timely manner or to the extent anticipated or at all. We may experience difficulties integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of an acquired company or be subjected to liability for the target’s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest. Such integration may divert management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business. Future acquisitions may also expose us to 17 potential risks, including risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions, the possibility of insufficient revenues to offset the expenses we incur in connection with an acquisition and the potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees and suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses. We may not be able to timely complete our future strategic growth initiatives or within our anticipated cost estimates, if at all. As part of our efforts to grow our hashrate and remain competitive in the market, we have acquired facilities, entered into new and re-negotiated purchased power agreements and invested in additional new and used mining equipment. We are also reliant on third parties for our expansion efforts, including construction contractors and providers of infrastructure equipment, who may be burdened by delays in manufacturing, supply chain problems, less access to capital due to macro-economic conditions, or inflation. This could increase our costs and/or delay our expansion and acquisition efforts. If we are unable to complete our planned expansions or acquisitions on schedule and within our anticipated cost estimates, our deployment of newly purchased miners may be delayed, which could affect our competitiveness and our results of operation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market price for our securities. We may experience increased compliance costs as a result of future strategic acquisitions. Future strategic acquisitions could carry substantial compliance burdens, which may limit our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, and which may require our management and personnel to shift their focus to such compliance burdens and away from their other functions. Such increased costs and compliance burdens could affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such strategic acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer as a result. In the future, we may require additional financing to sustain and expand our operations, and we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects. Our ability to operate profitably and to grow our business is dependent upon, among other things, generating sufficient revenue from our operations and, when and if needed, obtaining financing. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to operate and/or expand our business, we will be required to raise additional capital to fund operating deficits (if applicable) and the growth of our business, pursue our business plans and to finance our operating activities, including through equity or debt financings, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain capital through sales of bitcoin may also be impacted by the volatility in the price of bitcoin. We have previously raised capital to finance our strategic growth of our business through public offerings of our common stock, including through our at-the-market offering program, and we expect to need to raise additional capital through similar public offerings to finance the completion of current and future expansion initiatives. Utilizing those sources may be more challenging in the current financial market conditions, in particular where trading volume is diminished. We may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could impair our growth and adversely impact our existing operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, stockholder ownership interest in the Company may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights as a stockholder. Debt and equity financings, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as redeeming our shares of common stock, making investments, incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. We maintain our cash at financial institutions, often in balances that exceed federally insured limits. We maintain our cash at financial institutions, often in balances that exceed federally insured limits. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts at banking institutions in the United States that we believe are of high quality. Cash held in these accounts often exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) 18 insurance limits. If such banking institutions were to fail, we could lose all or a portion of the amounts held in excess of such insurance limitations. The FDIC recently took control of three such banking institutions, Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, 2023, Signature Bank on March 12, 2023 and First Republic Bank on May 1, 2023. While we did not have an account at any of these three banks, in the event of the failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our business and financial position. Our ability to open accounts at certain financial institutions is limited by the policies of such financial institutions to not accept clients that are in the digital asset industry. The impact of geopolitical and economic events on the demand for bitcoin is uncertain. Geopolitical crises may trigger large-scale purchases of bitcoin, which could rapidly increase the price of bitcoin. This may, however, also increase the likelihood of a subsequent price swing in the opposite direction as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, ultimately decreasing the value of bitcoin or any other digital asset in our possession. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in generally uncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold. Alternatively, global crises and economic downturns may discourage investment in bitcoin and digital assets in general as investors shift their investments towards less volatile asset classes. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. The value of bitcoin has historically been subject to wide swings. Because we do not currently hedge our investment in bitcoin and do not intend to for the foreseeable future, we are directly exposed to bitcoin’s price volatility and surrounding risks. The market price of one bitcoin in our principal market ranged from approximately $15,460 to $31,862 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and ranged from approximately $17,567 to $69,000 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. While bitcoin prices are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms, they have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoin, the maintenance and development of the software protocol of the bitcoin network, changes in consumer demographics and public tastes, fraudulent or illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Furthermore, pricing may be the result of, and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of bitcoin, or our share price, making prices more volatile. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell bitcoin that we hold, or the number of bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell bitcoins are currently determined by management by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time. Such decisions, however well-informed, may result in untimely sales and even losses, adversely affecting an investment in us. At this time, we do not anticipate engaging in any hedging activities related to our holding of bitcoin; this would expose us to substantial decreases in the price of bitcoin. The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or other alternatives. The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to abandon bitcoin. As we exclusively mine bitcoin, and expect to exclusively mine bitcoin in the future, we could face difficulty adapting to emergent digital ledgers, blockchains or alternatives thereto. This could prevent us from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account and therefore harm investors. Bitcoin is subject to halving; the reward for successfully solving a block will halve several times in the future and its value may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction in the rewards we receive from our mining efforts. Halving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm. In an event referred to as bitcoin “halving,” the bitcoin reward for mining any 19 block is cut in half. For example, the mining reward for bitcoin declined from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoin on May 11, 2020. This process is scheduled to occur once every 210,000 blocks. It is estimated that bitcoin will next halve in April 2024 and then approximately every four years thereafter until the total amount of bitcoin rewards issued reaches 21 million, which is expected to occur around 2140. Once 21 million bitcoin are generated, the network will stop producing more. Currently, there are more than 19 million bitcoin in circulation. While bitcoin prices have had a history of price fluctuations around halving events, there is no guarantee that any such price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the price of bitcoin does not follow these anticipated halving events, the revenue from our mining operations would decrease, and we may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease mining operations altogether, which may adversely affect an investment in us. Furthermore, such reductions in bitcoin rewards for uncovering blocks may result in a reduction in the aggregate hashrate of the bitcoin network as the incentive for miners decreases. Miners ceasing operations would reduce the collective processing power on the network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions and make the bitcoin network more vulnerable to malicious actors or botnets obtaining control in excess of 50% of the processing power active on the blockchain. Such events may adversely affect our activities and an investment in us. Our reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may adversely affect an investment in us. We currently rely on Foundry Digital’s open access mining pool (""pool"") that supports bitcoin to receive our mining rewards and fees from the network. Our pool has the sole discretion to modify the terms of our agreement at any time, and, therefore, our future rights and relationship with our pool may change. In general, mining pools allow miners to combine their computing and processing power, increasing their chances of solving a block and getting rewarded by the bitcoin network. The rewards, distributed proportionally to our contribution to the pool’s overall mining power, are distributed by the pool operator. Should our pool's operator systems suffer downtime due to a cyber-attack, software malfunction or other similar issues, our ability to mine and receive revenue will be negatively impacted. Furthermore, while we receive daily reports from our pool detailing the total processing power provided to the pool and the proportion of that total processing power we provided to determine the distribution of rewards to us, we are dependent on the accuracy of our pool’s record keeping. Therefore, we have little means of recourse against our pool's operator if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by the mining pool operator is incorrect, other than leaving the pools. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our pool, we may experience reduced rewards for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations. Forks in the bitcoin network may occur in the future, which may affect the value of bitcoins held by us. A small group of contributors can propose refinements or improvements to the bitcoin network’s source code that alter the protocols and software that govern the bitcoin network and the properties of bitcoin, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new bitcoin. This is known as a “fork.” In the event a developer or group of developers proposes modifications to the bitcoin network that are not accepted by a majority of miners and users, but that are nonetheless accepted by a substantial plurality of miners and users, two or more competing and incompatible blockchain implementations could result. This is known as a “hard fork.” The value of bitcoin after the creation of a fork is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, the value of the fork product, market reaction to the creation of the fork product and the occurrence of forks in the future. As such, existing forks, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, and future forks may have a negative effect on bitcoin’s value and may adversely affect an investment in us. The open-source structure of the bitcoin network protocol means that the contributors to the protocol are generally not directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the protocol. A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the bitcoin network and an investment in us. As an open-source project, bitcoin does not generate revenues for its contributors, and contributors are generally not compensated for maintaining and updating the bitcoin network protocol. The lack of guaranteed financial incentives for contributors to maintain or develop the bitcoin network and the lack of guaranteed resources to adequately address 20 emerging issues with the bitcoin network may reduce incentives to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner. To the extent that contributors may fail to adequately update and maintain the bitcoin network protocol, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. Banks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities. A number of companies that engage in bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions. To the extent that such events may happen to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. Bitcoins held by us are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections. We do not hold our bitcoins with a banking institution or a member of the FDIC or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”), and, therefore, our bitcoins are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions. As a result, we may suffer a loss with respect to our bitcoins that are not covered by insurance, and we may not be able to recover any of our carried value in these bitcoins if they are lost or stolen or suffer significant and sustained reduction in conversion spot price. If we are not otherwise able to recover damages in connection with these losses, our business and results of operations may suffer, which may have a material negative impact on our stock price. Bitcoins we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access. There is a risk that some or all of our bitcoins could be lost or stolen. Bitcoins are stored in and accessed by cryptocurrency sites commonly referred to as “wallets.” A hot wallet refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the Internet. Generally, hot wallets are easier to set up and access than wallets in cold storage, but they are also more susceptible to hackers and other technical vulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold storage is generally more secure than hot storage, but is not ideal for quick or regular transactions. When we keep our bitcoin in cold storage, we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of our cryptocurrency assets. We currently mine bitcoin by contributing to and benefiting from our pool’s processing power. Our share of bitcoins mined from our pool is initially received by us in wallets we control, which are maintained by Coinbase. We currently sell the majority of the bitcoin we mine and utilize hot wallets to hold this bitcoin immediately prior to selling for working capital purposes. We hold any remainder of our bitcoin in cold storage. Bitcoins we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access. Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure bitcoins, such as by attacking the bitcoin network source code, exchange miners, third-party platforms (including Coinbase), cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of substantial holdings of bitcoin, and as we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments and profitability. If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on the bitcoin network, such actor or botnet could manipulate the network to adversely affect us, which would adversely affect an investment in us. If a malicious actor or botnet, a collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers, obtains over 50% of the processing power dedicated to mining bitcoin, such actor or botnet may be able to construct fraudulent blocks or prevent certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at all. The malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the order of transactions, though it could not generate new units or transactions using such control. The malicious actor or botnet could also “double-spend,” or spend the same 21 bitcoin in more than one transaction, or it could prevent transactions from being validated. In certain instances, reversing any fraudulent or malicious changes made to the bitcoin blockchain may not be possible. Although there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of blockchains achieved through controlling over 50% of the processing power on the bitcoin network, it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded, and could exceed, the 50% threshold on the bitcoin network. This possibility creates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of bitcoin transactions. To the extent that the bitcoin ecosystem, and the administrators of mining pools, do not have adequate controls and responses in place, the risk of a malicious actor obtaining control of the processing power may increase. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account and harm investors. The loss or destruction of private keys required to access our bitcoins may be irreversible. Our loss of access to our private keys or our experience of a data loss relating to our bitcoins could adversely affect an investment in us. Bitcoins may only be controlled by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which they are held. We publish the public key relating to digital wallets in use when we verify the receipt or transfers of bitcoins to and from our wallets and disseminate such information into the network on an anonymous basis, but we safeguard the private keys relating to such digital wallets. Digital asset exchanges, such as Coinbase, where we hold our bitcoin, engage in similar practices. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our bitcoins and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our bitcoins whether by us or digital asset exchanges where we hold our bitcoin, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. The digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, trade are relatively new and largely unregulated, and thus may be exposed to fraud and failure. Such failures may result in a reduction in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and can adversely affect an investment in us. Digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies trade are relatively new and, in most cases, largely unregulated. Many digital exchanges do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, cryptocurrency exchanges, including prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of the volume of digital asset trading. A perceived lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to business failure, hackers or malware, government-mandated regulation, or fraud, may reduce confidence in digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in cryptocurrency values. These potential consequences of a digital asset exchange’s failure could adversely affect an investment in us. We may face several risks due to disruptions in the digital asset markets, including but not limited to the risk from depreciation in our stock price, financing risk, risk of increased losses or impairments in our investments or other assets, risks of legal proceedings and government investigations, and risks from price declines or price volatility of digital assets. In the second half of 2022 and beginning of 2023, some of the well-known digital asset market participants, including Celsius Network, Voyager Digital Ltd., Three Arrows Capital and Genesis Global Holdco LLC, declared bankruptcy, resulting in a loss of confidence in participants of the digital asset ecosystem and negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly. In November 2022, FTX, the third-largest digital asset exchange by volume at the time, halted customer withdrawals, and shortly thereafter, FTX and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy. In response to these and other similar events (including significant activity by various regulators regarding digital asset activities, such as enforcement actions, against a variety of digital asset entities, including Coinbase and Binance), the digital asset markets, including the market for bitcoin specifically, have experienced extreme price volatility and several other entities in the digital asset industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected, further undermining confidence in the digital asset markets and in bitcoin. These events have also negatively impacted the liquidity of the digital asset markets as certain entities affiliated with FTX and platforms such as Coinbase and 22 Binance have engaged, or may continue to engage, in significant trading activity. If the liquidity of the digital asset markets continues to be negatively impacted by these events, digital asset prices (including the price of bitcoin) may continue to experience significant volatility and confidence in the digital asset markets may be further undermined. These events are continuing to develop and it is not possible to predict at this time all of the risks that they may pose to us, our service providers or on the digital asset industry as a whole. Although we had no direct exposure to FTX or any of the above-mentioned cryptocurrency companies (with the exception of Coinbase, which is discussed in “—Potential that, in the event of a bankruptcy filing by a custodian, bitcoin held in custody could be determined to be property of a bankruptcy estate and we could be considered a general unsecured creditor thereof”), nor any material assets that may not be recovered or may otherwise be lost or misappropriated due to the above-mentioned bankruptcies, the failure or insolvency of large exchanges like FTX or other significant players in the digital asset space may cause the price of bitcoin to fall and decrease confidence in the ecosystem, which could adversely affect an investment in us. Such market volatility has had a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, and we expect our results of operations to continue to be affected by bitcoin’s price as the results of our operations are significantly tied to the price of bitcoin. If we do not continue adjusting our short-term strategy to optimize our operating efficiency in the current dynamic market conditions, such market conditions could have a further negative result on our business, prospects or operations. We may not have adequate sources of recovery if our bitcoin holdings are lost, stolen or destroyed. We rely on Coinbase to facilitate the custody of our bitcoins. If our bitcoin holdings are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party, including Coinbase, liable to us, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy our claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for us might be limited, to the extent identifiable, to other responsible third parties (e.g., a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim of ours. While Coinbase maintains insurance coverage of such types and amounts as Coinbase asserts to be commercially reasonable for its custodial services provided under the Company’s custody agreement with Coinbase, including certain commercial crime insurance of limited aggregate principal amount which covers losses stemming from fraud, security breach, hack and asset theft, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to protect the Company against all losses of its bitcoin holdings held in custody with Coinbase, whether or not stemming from security breaches, cyberattacks or other types of unlawful activity. See “–Our limited insurance protection exposes us and our stockholders to the risk of loss of our bitcoin for which no person is liable.” Our ability to adopt technology in response to changing security needs or trends and reliance on a third party, Coinbase, for custody pose a challenge to the safekeeping of our bitcoin holdings. The history of digital asset exchanges has shown that exchanges and large holders of digital assets must adapt to technological change in order to secure and safeguard their digital assets. All of the bitcoin we hold is held in either cold or hot storage by Coinbase. We rely on Coinbase’s security systems, derived from established, industry-best practices, to safeguard our bitcoin holdings from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. We believe that we may become a more appealing target of security threats as the size of our bitcoin holdings grow. To the extent that either Coinbase or we are unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats, our bitcoin holdings may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which could adversely affect an investment in us. To the extent that Coinbase is no longer able to safeguard our assets, we would be at risk of loss if safeguarding protocols fail. Security threats to us could result in a loss of our bitcoin holdings or damage to our reputation and brand, each of which could adversely affect an investment in us. Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in the digital asset exchange markets, for example since the launch of the bitcoin network. Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses, could harm our business operations or result in loss of our bitcoin holdings. Any breach of our infrastructure could result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect an investment in us. Furthermore, we believe that, as our assets grow, we may become a more appealing target for security threats such as hackers and malware. 23 We rely on Coinbase’s security systems, derived from established, industry-best practices, to safeguard our bitcoin holdings from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. Nevertheless, Coinbase’s security systems may not be impenetrable and may not be free from defect or immune to acts of God, and any loss due to a security breach, software defect or act of God may be borne by us. Our security system and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of an employee of ours, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our private keys, data or bitcoin. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of ours to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security systems occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security systems could be harmed, which could adversely affect an investment in us. In the event of a security breach, we may be forced to cease operations, or suffer a reduction in assets, the occurrence of each of which could adversely affect an investment in us. A loss of confidence in our security systems, or a breach of our security systems, may adversely affect us and the value of an investment in us. We will take measures to protect us and our bitcoin from unauthorized access, damage or theft; however, it is possible that our security systems may not prevent the improper access to, or damage or theft of, our bitcoin holdings. A security breach could harm our reputation or result in the loss of some or all of our bitcoin. A resulting perception that our measures do not adequately protect our bitcoin holdings could result in a loss of current or potential stockholders, reducing demand for our common stock and causing our shares to decrease in value. Bitcoin transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoin may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed digital asset transactions could adversely affect an investment in us. Bitcoin transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the processing power on the bitcoin network. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of bitcoin or a theft of bitcoin generally will not be reversible, and we may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft. While we exchange our bitcoin directly for U.S. dollars on Coinbase and do not presently use, or expect to use, our bitcoin for any other transactions other than limited payroll-related payments, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, our bitcoin could be transferred from us in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties. To the extent that we are unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third party or are incapable of identifying the third party which has received our bitcoin through error or theft, we will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred bitcoin. To the extent that we are unable to seek redress for such error or theft, such loss could adversely affect an investment in us. We may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on not only the price of bitcoin but also our ability to mine bitcoin. A disruption of the Internet may adversely affect the mining and use of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. Generally, cryptocurrencies and our business of mining bitcoin are dependent upon the Internet. A significant disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt bitcoin’s network operations until the disruption is resolved and have an adverse effect on the price of bitcoin and our ability to mine bitcoin. The limited rights of legal recourse available to us expose us and our investors to the risk of loss of our bitcoins for which no person is liable. At this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative or prosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrency; though law enforcement agencies like the FBI have recovered stolen bitcoin, that recovery has required significant amounts of time. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. 24 The sale of our bitcoins to pay for expenses at a time of low bitcoin prices could adversely affect an investment in us. We sell our bitcoins to pay for operating expenses and growth on an as-needed basis. Consequently, we may sell our bitcoins at a time when bitcoin prices are low, which could adversely affect an investment in us. At this time, we do not engage in contractual or financial hedging activities related to our bitcoin holdings to mitigate potential decreases in the price of bitcoin. See the above risk factor entitled, “The value of bitcoin has historically been subject to wide swings. Because we do not currently hedge our investment in bitcoin and do not intend to for the foreseeable future, we are directly exposed to bitcoin’s price volatility and surrounding risks."" Demand for bitcoin is driven, in part, by its status as a prominent and secure cryptocurrency. It is possible that a cryptocurrency other than bitcoin could have features that make it more desirable to a material portion of the digital asset user base, resulting in a reduction in demand for bitcoin. Bitcoin holds a “first-to-market” advantage over other cryptocurrencies. This first-to-market advantage is driven in large part by having the largest user base and, more importantly, the largest combined mining power in use. Nonetheless, another form of cryptocurrency could become materially popular due to either a perceived or exposed shortcoming of the bitcoin network or a perceived advantage of another form of digital currency. If another form of digital currency obtains significant market share, this could reduce the interest in, and value of, bitcoin and the profitability of our bitcoin operations. Our mining costs may be in excess of our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business and adversely impact an investment in us. Mining operations are costly and our expenses may increase in the future. Increases in mining expenses may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue (i.e., the value of bitcoin mined). Our expenses may become greater than we anticipate, and our investments to make our business more cost-efficient may not succeed. Further, even if our expenses remain the same or decline, our revenues may not exceed our expenses to the extent the price of bitcoin decreases without a corresponding decrease in bitcoin network difficulty. Increases in our costs without corresponding increases in our revenue would adversely affect our profitability and could seriously harm our business and an investment in us. The properties included in our mining operations may experience damages, including damages that may not be covered by insurance. Our current mining locations and any future sites we establish will be subject to a variety of risks relating to physical condition and operation, including but not limited to: Although our mining sites are equipped with standard security measures normally associated with a traditional data center, and insured by tier one insurance providers, our mining sites could still be rendered inoperable, temporarily or permanently, as a result of a fire or other natural disaster or by a terrorist or other events outside of our control. For a summary of our insurance coverage, see “Business—Insurance.” The measures we have taken, and may take in the future, to prevent and insure against these risks may prove to not be sufficient or effective. We are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power. The operation of a bitcoin mining facility requires significant amounts of electrical power. Any mining site we currently operate or establish in the future can only be successful if we can continue to obtain sufficient electrical 25 power for that site on a cost-effective basis. We currently have five fully-owned campuses and operate additional miners under one active hosting agreement, each of which have unique power agreements. Geopolitical events including the war in Ukraine and inflationary impacts have caused power prices to increase worldwide; if power prices continue to increase while bitcoin prices decrease, our ability to profitability mine bitcoin would be negatively impacted. We may curtail the energy used by our mining operations in times of heightened energy prices or in the case of a grid-wide electricity shortage either voluntarily or by agreement with utility providers. We may also encounter other situations where utilities or government entities restrict or prohibit the provision of electricity to mining operations. In these cases, our ability to produce bitcoin may be negatively affected. Because we also expect to expand to additional sites, there may be significant competition for suitable locations with access to affordable power. Additionally, our facilities could be adversely affected by a power outage. Although we maintain limited backup power at certain sites, it would not be feasible to run miners on back-up power generators in the event of a government restriction on electricity or a power outage. To the extent we are unable to receive adequate power supply and are forced to reduce or cease our operations due to the availability or cost of electrical power, our business would be adversely affected. Further, one of our key strategies is to use sustainable and environmentally friendly sources of energy, including nuclear energy sources. To the extent we are unable to obtain sustainable sources of energy on a cost-effective basis and execute on this strategy, our business could be adversely affected. Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our ESG practices and the impacts of climate change may result in additional costs or risks. Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. In May 2021, the SEC proposed rule changes that would require public companies to include certain climate-related disclosures in their periodic reports, including information about climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on their business, results of operations, or financial condition, and certain climate-related financial statement metrics in a note to their audited financial statements. The SEC noted that such rule changes were proposed in response to investor demands for consistent and comparable data on climate change. Furthermore, increased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in increased public scrutiny of our business and our industry, and our management team may divert significant time and energy away from our operations and towards responding to such scrutiny and reassuring our employees. In addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supplies of energy, and demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and could increase our insurance and other operating costs, including, potentially, to repair damage incurred as a result of extreme weather events or to renovate or retrofit facilities to better withstand extreme weather events. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on our operations, or if our operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted. Our operations and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in cryptocurrencies. We compete with other users and/or companies that are mining bitcoin and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed by or linked to bitcoin. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrencies directly, which could limit the market for our shares and reduce their liquidity. The emergence of other financial vehicles and exchange-traded funds have increased scrutiny on cryptocurrencies, and such scrutiny could be applicable to us and impact our 26 ability to successfully establish or maintain a public market for our securities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors. From time to time, as market conditions change, large holders of bitcoin may sell large amounts all at once into the market, thereby constraining the growth of the price of bitcoin. There are very large holders of bitcoin, including other miners, that may choose or be forced to sell large quantities of bitcoin all at once or over a short period of time. Such an increase in selling volume could create downward pressure on the market price of bitcoin. Potential that, in the event of a bankruptcy filing by a custodian, bitcoin held in custody could be determined to be property of a bankruptcy estate and we could be considered a general unsecured creditor thereof. All of the bitcoin we hold is held in either cold or hot storage by Coinbase. The treatment of bitcoins held by custodians that file for bankruptcy protection is uncharted territory in U.S. Bankruptcy law. We cannot say with certainty whether our bitcoin held in custody by Coinbase, should it declare bankruptcy, would be treated as property of the bankruptcy estate and, accordingly, whether we would be treated as a general unsecured creditor with respect of our bitcoin held in custody by Coinbase. If we are treated as a general unsecured creditor, we may not be able to recover our bitcoin in the event of a Coinbase bankruptcy or a bankruptcy of any other custodian we may use in the future. There are risks related to technological obsolescence, the vulnerability of the global supply chain for cryptocurrency hardware disruption and difficulty in obtaining new hardware which may have a negative effect on our business. As our mining facilities operate, our miners experience ordinary wear and tear and may face more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors beyond our control. The degradation of our miners will also require us, over time, to repair or replace miners which are no longer functional. Additionally, as technology evolves, we may be required to acquire newer models of miners to remain competitive in the market. This upgrading process requires substantial capital investment, and we may face challenges in doing so on a timely and cost-effective basis. Further, the global supply of miners is unpredictable and presently heavily dependent on manufacturers headquartered in China, with manufacturing in Asia, which was severely affected by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently utilize several types of ASIC miners as part of our mining operation, including Bitmain Antminers, Canaan Avalon miners and MicroBT WhatsMiners, all of which are produced in China, Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand. Geopolitical matters, including the relationship of the U.S. with China, may impact our ability to import ASIC miners. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate replacement parts for our existing miners or obtain additional miners from manufacturers on a timely basis. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors. Since there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of digital assets, including bitcoin, it is unclear how we will be required to account for transactions involving digital assets. Because there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition and no official guidance has yet been provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC as to bitcoin miners, it is unclear how bitcoin miners may in the future be required to account for cryptocurrency transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards or interpretations by the SEC, particularly as they relate to the Company and the financial accounting of our bitcoin-related operations, could result in changes in our accounting treatment and the necessity to restate our financial statements. In addition, the accounting policies of many companies are being subjected to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public, and we have received comments from the staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance Office of Crypto Assets (the “Staff”) during fiscal year 2023 related to the accounting of our bitcoin-related operations. See Item 1B, Unresolved Staff Comments. Such continued uncertainty with regard to financial accounting matters, particularly as they relate to the Company, the financial accounting of our bitcoin-related operations and the SEC comments we have received in respect of such matters, could negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to raise capital. 27 If we fail to grow our hashrate, we may be unable to compete, and our results of operations could suffer. Generally, a bitcoin miner’s chance of solving a block on the bitcoin blockchain and earning a bitcoin reward is a function of the miner’s hashrate (i.e., the amount of computing power devoted to supporting the bitcoin blockchain), relative to the global network hashrate. As demand for bitcoin has increased, the global network hashrate has increased, and to the extent more adoption of bitcoin occurs, we would expect the demand for bitcoin would increase, drawing more mining companies into the industry and further increasing the global network hashrate. As new and more powerful and energy-efficient mining servers are deployed, the global network hashrate will continue to increase, meaning a miner’s respective percentage of the total daily rewards will decline unless it deploys additional hashrate at pace with the growth of global hashrate. Accordingly, to compete in this highly competitive industry, we believe we will need to continue to acquire new miners, both to replace those lost to ordinary wear and tear and other damage, and to increase our hashrate to keep up with a growing global network hashrate. We plan to grow our hashrate, in part, by acquiring newer, more powerful and energy-efficient miners. These new miners are highly specialized servers that are very difficult to produce at scale. As a result, there are limited producers capable of producing large numbers of sufficiently effective miners. The cost of these miners is directly correlated to bitcoin prices and the profitability of bitcoin mining. Demand for new miners increased in response to increased bitcoin prices in 2021 followed by a decreased in demand due to falling bitcoin prices in 2022. We observed the price of these new miners followed changes in demand, resulting in elevated machine prices when bitcoin mining economics are high and significantly lower prices when these economics are strained. As a result, positive bitcoin economics may negatively impact our future equipment costs and increase the competition to secure mining equipment. If we are unable to acquire sufficient numbers of new miners or access sufficient capital to fund our acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect investments in our securities. Our business has been, and in the future may be, subject to risks arising from pandemic, epidemic or an outbreak of diseases, such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. Since then, COVID-19 spread across the globe and impacted worldwide economic activity, including through quarantines, travel bans and restrictions, shelter-in-place orders, shutdowns of businesses, reductions in business activity, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. These measures impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, as well as the operations of our customers, our partners and our vendors and suppliers. Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, and many of our key suppliers, are located in regions which have been and may continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Our suppliers worldwide have also been affected by COVID-19 and may continue to experience material impacts well beyond the end of the pandemic. Specifically, the manufacture of components of our miners, the final assembly of our miners and other critical operations are concentrated in China and other geographic locations that have been impacted by COVID-19 and in which local governments continue to take measures to try to contain the pandemic. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. Such measures, as well as restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and other factors have historically impacted, and may further adversely affect our supply chain, consistent with their effect across many industries, including creating shipping and logistics challenges and placing significant limits on component supplies. They have also historically and may further result in significantly increased costs for shipping miners, related components and infrastructure. In addition, while the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic's continued effect on the global economy and our business in particular are difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has historically resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our working capital and liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 or a similar 28 health epidemic could impact overall spending, adversely affecting demand for bitcoin, our business and the value of our common stock. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the potential resurgence of COVID-19, the duration and spread of any other pandemic, its severity, any related restrictions on travel, any closures worldwide, the effectiveness of previous and any future actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, including, without limitation, the effectiveness of vaccination initiatives in the United States and worldwide and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of capital and financial condition, though the full extent and duration of any such impact is also uncertain. Global economic conditions, including continuing or worsening inflationary issues and associated changes in monetary policy and potential economic recession, and geopolitical events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the subsequent imposition of sanctions as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. General economic and political conditions such as economic recessions, interest rates, rising inflation, commodity prices, foreign currency fluctuations, international tariffs, social, political and economic risks, hostilities or the perception that hostilities may be imminent, military conflict and acts of war, including further escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the related response, including sanctions or other restrictive actions, by the United States and/or other countries, as well as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, could adversely impact our business, supply chain or partners. The U.S. inflation rate steadily increased since 2021 and into 2022 and 2023. These inflationary pressures, as well as disruptions in our supply chain, have increased the costs of most other goods, services and personnel, which have in turn caused our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. Sustained levels of high inflation caused the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to increase interest rates, which have raised the cost of acquiring capital and reduced economic growth, either of which—or the combination thereof—could hurt the financial and operating results of our business. In addition, the extent and duration of the situation in Ukraine, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be significant. The effects of such global economic conditions, including continuing or worsening inflationary issues and associated changes in monetary policy or potential economic recession, and geopolitical events could adversely affect our ability to access the capital and other financial markets, and if so, we may need to consider alternative sources of funding for some of our growth and operations and for working capital, which may increase our cost of, as well as adversely impact our access to, capital. Divestitures and discontinued operations could negatively impact our business, and retained liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial results. In connection with the execution of our strategy to focus entirely on bitcoin mining, we have completed several divestitures, including the divestiture of a part of our former energy business. We intend to make further dispositions in connection with our non-bitcoin mining related businesses, which we may not be able to complete on favorable terms or at all. If we do not realize the expected benefits of these divestitures or our post-completion liabilities and continuing obligations are substantial and exceed our expectations, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. As a result of such dispositions, bitcoin mining is now the sole driver of our business and revenues and is expected to continue to be the source of substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, which has the effect of increasing our exposure to the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, in the course of our discontinued operations, we may become subject to legal actions based on a claim that our legacy energy products are or were defective in workmanship or have caused personal or other injuries. We may also be subject to lawsuits and other claims in the future if our legacy products or installed systems malfunction, 29 including, for example, if any of our energy system offerings (such as installed racking systems, photovoltaic modules, batteries, inverters, or other products) causes injuries. Because energy systems and many of our other products are electricity-producing devices, it is possible that customers or their property could be injured or damaged by our products, whether due to product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. Further, since our products are used in systems that are made up of components sourced from third-party manufacturers, we may be subject to product liability claims even if our products do not malfunction. Additionally, any of our products could be subject to recalls due to product malfunctions or defects. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages that could require us to make significant payments, as well as subject us to adverse publicity, thereby damaging our reputation and competitive position. We rely on third-party manufacturing warranties, warranties provided by our manufacturing partners and our general liability insurance to cover product liability claims and have not obtained separate product liability insurance. Such warranties and insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims. Moreover, even if such warranties and insurance coverage are sufficient, any successful claim could significantly harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Our limited insurance protection exposes us and our stockholders to the risk of loss of our bitcoin for which no person is liable. We do not currently maintain our own insurance coverage for our bitcoin holdings, which are held in custody by Coinbase. In addition, while Coinbase maintains insurance coverage of such types and amounts as Coinbase asserts to be commercially reasonable for its custodial services provided under the Company’s custody agreement with Coinbase, including certain commercial crime insurance of limited aggregate principal amount which covers losses stemming from fraud, security breach, hack and asset theft, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to protect the Company against all losses of its bitcoin holdings held in custody with Coinbase, whether or not stemming from security breaches, cyberattacks or other types of unlawful activity. Therefore, a loss may be suffered with respect to our bitcoin that is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages, which could adversely affect our operations and, consequently, an investment in us. Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Enforcement Operations If regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require our registration as an MSB under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the BSA, or otherwise under state laws, we may incur significant compliance costs, which could be substantial or cost-prohibitive. If we become subject to these regulations, our costs in complying with them may have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations. To the extent our bitcoin mining activities cause us to be deemed a money services business (an “MSB”) under the regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”), we may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate us to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records. To the extent that our cryptocurrency activities cause us to be deemed a “money transmitter” ​(an “MT”) or be given an equivalent designation under state law in any state in which we operate, we may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. Currently, the New York State Department of Financial Services maintains a comprehensive “BitLicense” framework for businesses that conduct “virtual currency business activity.” In July 2020, Louisiana enacted the Virtual Currency Businesses Act. In October 2023, California enacted the Digital Financial Assets Law, which requires registration for certain digital financial asset business activities. We will continue to monitor for developments in state-level legislation, guidance or regulations applicable to us. Such additional federal or state regulatory obligations in the United States or obligations that could arise under the regulatory frameworks of other countries may cause us to incur significant expenses, possibly affecting our business and financial condition in a material and adverse manner. Furthermore, we and our service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to MSBs and MTs or similar obligations in other countries. If we are deemed to be subject to such additional regulatory oversight and registration 30 or licensing requirements, we may be required to substantially alter our bitcoin mining activities and possibly cease engaging in such activities. Any such action may adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and an investment in our company. Current regulation regarding the exchange of bitcoins under the CEA by the CFTC is unclear; to the extent we become subject to regulation by the CFTC in connection with our exchange of bitcoin, we may incur additional compliance costs, which may be significant. The Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the “CEA”), does not currently impose any direct obligations on us related to the mining or exchange of bitcoins. Generally, the CFTC, the federal agency that administers the CEA, regards bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as commodities. This position has been supported by decisions of federal courts. However, the CEA imposes requirements relative to certain transactions involving bitcoin and other digital assets that constitute a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option on such a contract), a swap or a transaction involving margin, financing or leverage that does not result in actual delivery of the commodity within 28 days to persons not defined as “eligible contract participants” or “eligible commercial entities” under the CEA (e.g., retail persons). Changes in the CEA or the regulations promulgated by the CFTC thereunder, as well as interpretations thereof and official promulgations by the CFTC, may impact the classification of bitcoin and, therefore, may subject bitcoin to additional regulatory oversight by the agency. Although to date the CFTC has not enacted regulations governing non-derivative or non-financed, margined or leveraged transactions in bitcoin, it has authority to commence enforcement actions against persons who violate certain prohibitions under the CEA related to transactions in any contract of sale of any commodity, including bitcoin, in interstate commerce (e.g., manipulation and engaging in certain deceptive practices). We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoin under the law. Any requirements imposed by the CFTC related to our mining activities or our transactions in bitcoin could cause us to incur additional extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby potentially materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company. Moreover, if our mining activities or transactions in bitcoin were deemed by the CFTC to constitute a collective investment in derivatives for our stockholders, we may be required to register as a commodity pool operator with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby potentially materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in the Company. While no provision of the CEA or CFTC rules, orders or rulings (except as noted herein) appear to be currently applicable to our business, this is subject to change. If the SEC or another regulatory body considers bitcoin to be a security under U.S. securities laws, we may be required to comply with significant SEC registration and/or other requirements. In general, novel or unique assets such as bitcoin and other digital assets may be classified as securities if they meet the definition of investment contracts under U.S. law. In recent years, the offer and sale of digital assets other than bitcoin, most notably Kik Interactive Inc.’s Kin tokens and Telegram Group Inc.’s TON tokens, have been deemed to be investment contracts by the SEC. While we believe that bitcoin is unlikely to be considered an investment contract, and thus a security under the investment contract definition, we cannot provide any assurances that digital assets that we may mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, including bitcoin, will never be classified as securities under U.S. law. This would obligate us to comply with registration and other requirements by the SEC and, therefore, cause us to incur significant, non-recurring expenses, thereby potentially materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company. It may be illegal now, or in the future, to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize similar cryptocurrency assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which could adversely affect us. Although currently cryptocurrencies generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, several countries, such as China, India and Russia, may continue taking regulatory actions in the future that could severely 31 restrict the right to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell or use cryptocurrency assets or to exchange any such cryptocurrency assets for local currency. For example, in China and Russia (India is currently proposing new legislation), it is illegal to accept payment in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrencies. In addition, in March 2021, the governmental authorities for the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia banned bitcoin mining in the province due to the industry’s intense electrical power demands and its negative environmental impacts. If other countries, including the U.S., implement similar restrictions, such restrictions may adversely affect us. For example, in New York State, a moratorium on certain bitcoin mining operations that run on carbon-based power sources was signed into law on November 22, 2022. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and thus harm investors. Changing environmental regulation and public energy policy may expose our business to new risks. Our bitcoin mining operations require a substantial amount of power and can only be successful, and ultimately profitable, if the costs we incur, including for electricity, are lower than the revenue we generate from our operations. As a result, any mine we establish can only be successful if we can obtain sufficient electrical power for that mine on a cost-effective basis, and our establishment of new mines requires us to find locations where that is the case. For instance, our plans and strategic initiatives for expansion are based, in part, on our understanding of current environmental and energy regulations, policies and initiatives enacted by federal, New York State and Georgia State regulators. If new regulations are imposed, or if existing regulations are modified, the assumptions we made underlying our plans and strategic initiatives may be inaccurate, and we may incur additional costs to adapt our planned business, if we are able to adapt at all, to such regulations. In addition, there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty for our business because the bitcoin mining industry, with its high energy demand, may become a target for future environmental and energy regulation. New legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. Further, any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. For example, the recently passed legislation in the state of New York imposing a moratorium on certain bitcoin mining operations that run carbon-based power. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be addressed, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Future developments regarding the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax purposes could adversely impact our business. Due to the new and evolving nature of digital assets and the absence of comprehensive legal guidance with respect to digital assets and related transactions, many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax treatment of transactions involving digital assets, such as the purchase and sale of bitcoin and the receipt of staking rewards and other digital asset incentives and rewards products, are uncertain, and it is unclear what guidance may be issued in the future with respect to the tax treatment of digital assets and related transactions. Current Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") guidance indicates that for U.S. federal income tax purposes digital assets such as bitcoins should be treated and taxed as property, and that transactions involving the payment of bitcoins for goods and services should be treated in effect as barter transactions. The IRS has also released guidance to the effect that, under certain circumstances, hard forks of digital currencies are taxable events giving rise to taxable income and guidance with respect to the determination of the tax basis of digital currency. However, current IRS guidance does not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets and related transactions. Moreover, although current IRS guidance addresses the treatment of certain forks, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of income inclusions for various digital asset transactions, including, but not limited to, staking rewards and other digital asset incentives and rewards products. While current IRS guidance creates 32 a potential tax reporting requirement for any circumstance where the ownership of a bitcoin passes from one person to another, it preserves the right to apply capital gains treatment to those transactions, which is generally favorable for investors in bitcoin. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not alter its existing position with respect to digital assets in the future or that other state, local and non-U.S. taxing authorities or courts will follow the approach of the IRS with respect to the treatment of digital assets such as bitcoin for income tax and sales tax purposes. Any such alteration of existing guidance or issuance of new or different guidance may have negative consequences including the imposition of a greater tax burden on investors in bitcoin or imposing a greater cost on the acquisition and disposition of bitcoin, generally, and potentially have a negative effect on the trading price of bitcoin or otherwise negatively impact our business. In addition, future technological and operational developments that may arise with respect to digital currencies may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital currencies for U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax purposes. Our interactions with the bitcoin network may expose us to SDN or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distributed ledger technology. The Office of Financial Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its specially designated nationals (“SDN”) list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. We also may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the persons with whom we transact. Risks Related to Our Securities The price of our common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate widely, which could result in substantial losses for investors. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Specifically, the trading price of our common stock has already been correlated, and, in the future, as we continue to expand our bitcoin mining business, may be increasingly correlated, to the trading prices of bitcoin. The stocks of 33 bitcoin mining companies have shown volatility relative to bitcoin. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency market prices, which have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors (including those discussed herein), are determined primarily by using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms. As noted elsewhere herein, while we had no direct exposure to FTX, the failure or insolvency of large exchanges like FTX may cause the price of bitcoin to fall and decrease confidence in the ecosystem, which could negatively impact our stock price. Furthermore, such prices may be subject to factors such as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to additional influence from fraudulent or illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Pricing may be the result of, and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of bitcoin, or our share price, inflating and making their market prices more. For example, the closing sales price of our common stock on September 30, 2022 was $3.18 and the closing price of bitcoin was $19,426 and, as of September 30, 2023, the closing sales price of our common stock was $3.81, and the closing price of Bitcoin was $26,961. In addition, the stock markets in general have often experienced volatility, including in the wake of COVID-19, that has sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations have caused, and may continue to cause, the trading price of our common stock to decline. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital, on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects, and on the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type may be expensive to defend and may divert our management’s attention and resources from the operation of our business. We have the right to designate and issue additional shares of preferred stock. If we were to designate and/or issue additional preferred stock, it is likely to have rights, preferences and privileges that may adversely affect the common stock. We are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of blank-check preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix for any series the dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights and other rights, preferences and privileges for the preferred stock. Currently, 2,000,000 shares are designated as Series A Preferred Stock, of which 1,750,000 shares are outstanding. The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to have the Company redeem each share of Series A Preferred Stock for three shares of our common stock only if a change of control event (as defined in the certificate of designation) occurs, and they are entitled to vote together with the holders of the Company’s common stock on all matters submitted to stockholders at a rate of forty-five (45) votes for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the preferred stock, could reduce the voting rights and powers of our common stock and the portion of our assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution in the book value per share of our common stock. The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, to the detriment of the investors in our common stock. We cannot assure that we will not, under certain circumstances, issue additional shares of our preferred stock. We are currently the subject of a shareholder class action, and may be subject to shareholder litigation in the future; our costs of defending such litigation, arbitration and other proceedings and any adverse outcome of such litigation, arbitration or other proceeding may have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations. We are currently, and may from time to time in the future be, involved in and subject to material litigation and other legal proceedings. In particular, on January 20, 2021, a purported stockholder of the Company, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a putative class action complaint (the “Class Complaint”) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain members of our executive management team. The Class Complaint alleges that, between December 31, 2020 and January 14, 2021, we and 34 certain members of our executive management team failed to disclose certain material information to investors and that, as a result of the foregoing, our positive statements about our business, operations and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. The claims made in the Class Complaint appear to be derived from a short seller report that was published about us. We have financed our strategic growth primarily by issuing new shares of our common stock in public offerings, which dilutes the ownership interests of our current stockholders, and which may adversely affect the market price of our securities. We have raised capital to finance our strategic growth of our business through public offerings of our common stock, including through our at-the-market offering program, and we expect to need to raise additional capital through similar public offerings to finance the completion of current and future expansion initiatives. Utilizing those sources may be more challenging in the current financial market conditions, in particular where trading volume is diminished. We may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could impair our growth and adversely impact our existing operations. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and the per share value of our common stock could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, the holders of any debt we issue would likely have priority over the holders of shares of our common stock in terms of order of payment preference. We may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or take other actions, including terms that require us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios that could otherwise not be in the interests of our stockholders. We have not paid dividends on shares of our common stock in the past and have no immediate plans to do so in the future. We have not paid, and do not plan to pay in the immediate future, any cash dividends with respect to our common stock. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We cannot assure stockholders that we will, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, stockholders should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock. If securities or industry analysts do not publish or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us now or in the future issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations. In April 2022, we entered into a Master Equipment Financing Agreement with Trinity Capital Inc., as the lender (the “Financing Agreement”). The Financing Agreement provided for up to $35,000 of borrowings to finance our acquisition of blockchain computing equipment. We received a loan of $20,000 at close, with the remaining $15,000 not requested for funding and cancelled. As of September 30, 2023, $11,730 in principal was outstanding and due to Trinity Capital Inc. The borrowings under the Financing Agreement are collateralized by 3,336 S19j Pro miners, which are located at our College Park, GA and Norcross, GA sites. The value of the miners collateralizing the borrowings under the Financing Agreement may be negatively impacted by adverse events affecting the digital asset markets and/or volatility in the price of bitcoin. Should we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and should Trinity Capital Inc. foreclose on the miners collaterizing our indebtedness, we could potentially lose up to 0.33 exahashes of computing power, or 3.3% of our current computing power. In addition, to the extent the value of the miners securing our borrowings under the Financing Agreement decreases and falls the below the aggregate amount of our obligations under the Financing Agreement, the lender thereunder would be our unsecured creditor in respect of the difference in the value of the collateral and our obligations. 35 In addition, our indebtedness could: We incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies; any failure to establish and maintain adequate internal controls and/or disclosure controls or to recruit, train and retain necessary accounting and finance personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to accurately and timely prepare our financial statements and otherwise make timely and accurate public disclosure. As a public company, we incur significant administrative, legal, accounting and other burdens and expenses beyond those of a private company, including public company reporting obligations and Nasdaq listing requirements. In particular, we have needed, and continue to need, to enhance and supplement our internal accounting resources with additional accounting and finance personnel with the requisite technical and public company experience and expertise to enable us to satisfy such reporting obligations. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls (including internal control over financial reporting) could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis, or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to regulatory enforcement action and stockholders claims. Furthermore, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the ""Sarbanes-Oxley Act""), we are required to document and test our internal control procedures and prepare annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our assessments must include disclosure of identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm also attests to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting. Testing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting involves significant costs and could divert management’s attention from other matters that are important to our business. Additionally, we may not be successful in remediating any deficiencies that may be identified. Our management has identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future. If we fail to remediate the material weakness or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results may be affected, and such failure may adversely affect investor confidence and business operations. In the course of preparing our financial statements for fiscal 2023, we and our independent registered public accounting firm have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified a material weakness related to information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the area of not having controls fully documented responding to all of the Complementary User Entity Controls forwarded through Software as a Service (SaaS) vendor audit reports in the design and implementation of suggested controls and not always having appropriate IT controls related to information produced by the entity (IPE), including spreadsheets, that are relevant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. To address our material weakness, we need to make changes to our program and controls as set forth in Part II, Item 9A “Controls and Procedures.” We will not be able to remediate this material weakness unless and until these steps 36 have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. We cannot assure you that the measures we plan to take will in fact be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or that such measures will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses, and our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. If we are unable to remediate our material weakness and otherwise implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements and satisfy our public reporting obligations within required time periods, could be adversely affected. We could also be required to restate financial statements for prior periods. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected and we could become subject to private litigation or to investigations or enforcement actions by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, all of which could require our expenditure of additional financial and management resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Those adverse consequences could be more severe if we are forced to effect any financial statement restatements. We are an accelerated filer and may no longer provide scaled disclosures as a smaller reporting company beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending December 31, 2023, which will increase our costs and demands on management. We are an accelerated filer and beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending December 31, 2023, we may no longer provide scaled disclosure as a “smaller reporting company” as defined under the Exchange Act. As a smaller reporting company, we had the option to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the ability to provide only two years of audited financial statements in our annual reports. In addition, as a non-accelerated filer and smaller reporting company, we have availed ourselves of the exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. However, we may no longer avail ourselves of this exemption as an accelerated filer, which will increase our expenses and require a significant amount of management time. Provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions. Members of our Board of Directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our bylaws as authorized by the Nevada Revised Statutes. Specifically, Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a director or officer is not individually liable to the company or its stockholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer unless it is proven that (1) the director's or officer's act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and (2) his or her breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This provision is intended to afford directors and officers protection against and to limit their potential liability for monetary damages resulting from suits alleging a breach of the duty of care by a director or officer. Accordingly, stockholders may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their fiduciary duty of care. In addition, our bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if one were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses our directors or officers incur in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise 37 would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the prevailing market prices for our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments The Company received comments from the Staff during fiscal year 2023. The Company’s responses to certain unresolved comments that the Company considers material are still under review by the Staff and are set forth below. Item 2. Properties On June 21, 2023, the Company acquired the outstanding membership interest in Coinmaker Miners LLC, a Georgia limited liability company that holds two lease agreements for real property in Dalton, GA and certain tangible property. Coinmaker Miners LLC was later renamed to CSRE Properties Dalton LLC. 38 On April 7, 2023, CleanSpark HQ, LLC, a single member limited liability company and subsidiary wholly owned by the Company, purchased certain real property located at 10424 South Eastern Avenue, Suite 200, Henderson, Nevada 89052 for $4,100. The property consists of approximately 15,000 square feet of office space. The Company intends to utilize this office space as its new corporate headquarters. On October 8, 2022, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC, closed on the acquisition of a lease for real property and the purchase of tangible property located at 2015 George J. Lyons Parkway, Sandersville, Georgia 31082. The property is located in Washington County, Georgia and consists of 41 existing modular data centers. The Company intends to utilize the property to conduct its bitcoin mining activities. On August 17, 2022, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, CSRE Properties Washington, LLC, closed on the purchase of real property located at 197 Dixie Wood Road, Washington, Georgia 30673. The total purchase price was $15,000 and the seller conveyed fee simple title by limited warranty deed. The property is located in Wilkes County, Georgia and contains approximately 27 acres. The Company intends to utilize the property to conduct its bitcoin mining activities. On August 6, 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, closed on the purchase of real property located at 5295 Brook Hollow Parkway, Norcross, Georgia 30071 (the “Norcross Property”). The total purchase price was $6,550 and the seller conveyed fee simple title by limited warranty deed. The Norcross Property consists of an office building of approximately 86,000 square feet on approximately seven acres of land. The Norcross Property is utilized by CleanBlok to conduct bitcoin mining activities. On May 20, 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary ATL, closed on the purchase of real property located at 2380 Godby Road, College Park, Georgia 30349 (the “College Park Property”), which it had been leasing prior to the purchase. The total purchase price was $4,712 and the seller conveyed fee simple title by limited warranty deed. The College Park Property consists of an office/warehouse building of approximately 41,387 square feet on approximately six acres of land. The College Park Property is utilized by ATL and CleanBlok to conduct bitcoin mining activities. On June 15, 2021, the Company entered into a lease for warehouse and office space at 2042 Corte Del Nogal, Suite C, Carlsbad California, 92011. The 5-year lease is for an approximately 12,704 square foot industrial unit and part of a larger 47,744 square foot multi-tenant industrial flex building and requires monthly base rent payments of $11. The leased property was previously utilized by our energy business, and in September 2023, we entered into a lease termination agreement with the lessor for approximately $200, which is recorded in ""Current liabilities held for sale"" in our consolidated balance sheets and the amount was paid in full in October 2023. On August 26, 2021, the Company entered into a lease for office space at 2370 Corporate Circle, Suite 160, Henderson, Nevada 89074. The 65-month lease is for 4,552 rentable square feet and an initial base rent of $11, increasing 3% each year. The Corporate Circle space is currently utilized as the CleanSpark corporate and executive headquarters. We also have an office located at 1185 S. 1800 W, Suite 3, Woods Cross, Utah 84087. We are currently on a year-to-year lease agreement that calls for us to make payments of $2 per month. This property is utilized by corporate employees. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, refer to Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company routinely is subject to and resolves matters that do not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period 39 for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 40 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information Our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “CLSK.” Holders of Our Common Stock As of December 1, 2023, we had 195 registered holders of record of our common stock. The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of our common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock. Dividends There are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws or agreements to which we are currently party, that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend: We have never declared any dividends on shares of our common stock, and we do not plan to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities In the quarter ended December 2021, we issued an aggregate of 8,404 unregistered shares of our common stock to the sellers of GridFabric in accordance with the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement entered into on August 31, 2020, based upon the achievement of certain milestones. The shares had a deemed aggregate value of $150. The shares of common stock were issued in a transaction not involving a public offering in reliance upon an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, there were no other unregistered sales of our securities that were not reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K or our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Repurchases The Company has not made any repurchases of shares or other units of any class of the Company’s equity securities during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report. Item 6. [Reserved] 41 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as anticipate, estimate, plan, project, continuing, ongoing, expect, believe, intend, may, will, should, could, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. See ""Forward-Looking Statements."" Business Overview We are a bitcoin mining company. We independently own and operate five data centers in Georgia for a total developed capacity of 230 MW. We are developing an additional 150 MW at our data center in Sandersville, GA. We have a partner in Massena, NY, that hosts 50 MW for us. We design our infrastructure to responsibly support bitcoin, the world’s most important digital commodity and an essential tool for financial independence and inclusion. We strive to leave the planet better than we found it by investing in communities that source low-carbon energy, like wind, solar, nuclear, and hydro. We endeavor to cultivate trust and transparency among our employees, the communities we operate in, and the people around the world who depend on bitcoin. Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the goal of serving as a digital means of exchanging and storing value. Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that depends upon a consensus-based network and a public ledger called a “blockchain,” which contains a record of every bitcoin transaction ever processed. The bitcoin network is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network, powered by users participating in the consensus protocol, with no central authority or middlemen, that has wide network participation. The authenticity of each bitcoin transaction is protected through digital signatures that correspond with addresses of users that send and receive bitcoin. Users have full control over remitting bitcoin from their own sending addresses. All transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are transparent, allowing those running the appropriate software to confirm the validity of each transaction. To be recorded on the blockchain, each bitcoin transaction is validated through a proof-of-work consensus method, which entails solving cryptographic functions to validate transactions and post them on the blockchain. This process is called mining. Miners are rewarded with bitcoins, both in the form of newly created bitcoins and fees in bitcoin, for successfully solving for the cryptographic function and providing computing power to the network. Factors such as access to computer processing capacity, interconnectivity, electricity cost, environmental factors (such as cooling capacity) and location play important roles in mining. As of September 30, 2023, our operating mining units were capable of producing over 9.6 EH/s of computing power. In bitcoin mining, “hashrate” is a measure of the computing and processing power and speed by which a computer processes transactions on the bitcoin network. We expect to continue increasing our computing power through 2024 and beyond as we expand our infrastructure at our owned sites in the State of Georgia, seek strategic acquisition targets, and through strategic co-location agreements. As of the date of this filing, December 1, 2023, we are capable of producing 10.0 EH/s of computing power. A company’s computing power measured in hashrate is generally considered to be one of the most important metrics for evaluating bitcoin mining companies. We owned approximately 113,500 miners as of September 30, 2023, of which approximately 88,000 were in service and the remainder mainly pertains to new machines ready to install in the Sandersville expansion. These miners range in age from 1-37 months and have an average age of approximately 12 months. We do not have scheduled downtime for our miners. We periodically perform unscheduled maintenance on our miners, but such downtime has not historically been significant. When performing unscheduled maintenance, we will typically replace the miner with a substitute miner to limit overall downtime. The miners owned as of September 30, 2023 have a range of energy efficiency (watts per terahash – “w/th”) of 21.5 to 38 w/th with an average energy efficiency of 28.4 w/th. We obtain bitcoin as a result of our mining operations, and we sell bitcoin from time to time, to support our operations and strategic growth. We do not currently plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin (other than as necessary to 42 convert our bitcoin into U.S. dollars) or to engage in hedging activities related to our holding of bitcoin; however, our decisions to hold or sell bitcoin at any given time may be impacted by the bitcoin market, which has been historically characterized by significant volatility. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell bitcoin that we hold, or the number of bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell bitcoins are currently determined by management by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time. The value of bitcoin has historically been subject to wide swings. The following table provides a range of intraday low and intraday high bitcoin prices between October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2023. Range of intraday bitcoin prices Quarterly Reporting Periods Ended Minimum Price Maximum Price December 31, 2021 $ 42,333 $ 69,000 March 31, 2022 $ 32,933 $ 48,240 June 30, 2022 $ 17,567 $ 47,469 September 30, 2022 $ 18,153 $ 25,215 December 31, 2022 $ 15,460 $ 21,479 March 31, 2023 $ 16,490 $ 29,190 June 30, 2023 $ 24,750 $ 31,444 September 30, 2023 $ 24,900 $ 31,862 As of September 30, 2023, we held approximately 2,243 bitcoins. The carrying value of our bitcoins as of September 30, 2023 was $56,241 on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We account for our bitcoin as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are subject to impairment losses if the fair value of our bitcoin decreases below their carrying value at any time since their acquisition. Impairment losses cannot be recovered for any subsequent increase in fair value. The carrying value of each bitcoin we held at the end of each reporting period reflects the lowest price of one bitcoin quoted on the active exchange at any time since its acquisition. Therefore, negative swings in the market price of bitcoin could have a material impact on our earnings and on the carrying value of our bitcoin. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries CSRE Properties, LLC, CSRE Property Management Company, LLC, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, CSRE Properties Washington, LLC, CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC, CSRE Properties Dalton, LLC and CleanSpark HQ, LLC, we maintain real property holdings. Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 ($ presented in 000’s, except for bitcoin price and information set forth under the heading “Bitcoin Mining Operations”) Bitcoin Mining Operations Overview We operate a fleet of servers commonly known as miners or ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), which are computer chips customized for a specific use. In the case of bitcoin mining, ASICs calculate the SHA-256 algorithm as efficiently and quickly as possible in order to compete with other miners to solve blocks. Each calculation is a hash, and each machine’s computational power is measured in terahash processed per second (“TH/s”). One terahash is equal to 1 trillion hashes. The more hashing power we produce and contribute to the total global hashrate, the higher our percentage of the block reward. For example, as of September 30, 2023, our operating hashrate was approximately 2.45% of the total global hashrate, and we received approximately the same percentage of the global blockchain rewards, which as of that date, equaled approximately 20-22 bitcoins per day. Ultimately, in order to mine profitably, we work to ensure that these mining rewards cover our direct operating costs. There are a variety of factors that influence our ability to mine bitcoin profitability. Our ability to mine profitability is dependent on successfully navigating these fluctuating variables, which include bitcoin’s value in USD (the volatility of which is described above), mining difficulty, global hashrate, power prices, fleet energy efficiency, data center energy efficiency and other factors. The energy efficiency of a mining fleet helps drive profitability, because the most significant direct expense for bitcoin mining is power. We measure efficiency by the watts of energy required to produce each terahash of 43 processing power. We believe we operate a highly efficient fleet of miners. The table below describes our fleet as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 and describes our miner efficiency and computing power as compared to the global computing power.

The table below describes the average cost of mining each bitcoin for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 and the total energy usage and cost per each kilowatt hour (“KWH”) utilized within both our five owned facilities and our hosted facility. 44 For the Year Ended Cost of Revenues - Analysis of costs to mine one bitcoin (per bitcoin amounts are actual) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Cost of Mining - Owned Facilities Cost of energy per bitcoin mined $ 12,668 $ 6,818 Other direct costs of mining - non energy utilities per bitcoin mined 75 277 Cost to mine one bitcoin - Owned facilities $ 12,743 $ 7,097 Cost of Mining - Hosted Facilities Hosting fees expense per one bitcoin $ 15,797 $ 14,885 Weighted average cost of mining one bitcoin (1) $ 13,498 $ 10,825 Average revenue of each bitcoin mined (2) $ 24,355 $ 34,916 Cost of mining one bitcoin as % of average bitcoin mining revenue 55.4 % 31.0 % Statistics Owned Facilities Total bitcoin mined at owned facilities 5,196 1,956 Bitcoin mining revenue - Owned facilities- ($ in thousands) $ 127,827 $ 67,999 Total miners in service in owned facilities - as of the periods ended 71,620 30,506 Total KWHs utilized 1,360,287,814 321,919,602 Total energy expense - ($ in thousands) $ 65,824 $ 13,334 Cost per KWH $ 0.048 $ 0.041 Energy expense as percentage of bitcoin mining revenue, net 51.5 % 19.6 % Other direct costs of mining - non energy utilities - ($ in thousands) $ 391 $ 542 Hosted Facilities Total bitcoin mined at hosted facilities 1,707 1,796 Bitcoin mining revenue - Hosted facilities- ($ in thousands) $ 40,294 $ 63,001 Total miners in service in hosted facilities - as of the periods ended 16,325 16,439 Total KWHs utilized 420,585,554 273,560,450 Total hosting fee expense - ($ in thousands) $ 26,965 $ 26,736 Hosting fee per KWH $ 0.064 $ 0.098 Hosting fee expense as percentage of bitcoin mining revenue, net 66.9 % 42.4 % (1) Weighted average cost of mining one bitcoin is calculated by dividing the sum of total energy expense and other direct costs of mining non-energy utilities (owned facilities) and total hosting fee expense (hosted facilities) by the total bitcoin mined during the respective periods. (2) Average revenue of each bitcoin mined is calculated by dividing the sum of bitcoin mining revenue for both owned and hosted facilities by the total number of bitcoin mined during the respective periods. The Company determines Coinbase as the principal market for valuing bitcoin transactions and uses the daily closing prices as the source of recording revenue. See the table ""Range of intraday bitcoin prices"" for information on the range of intraday bitcoin prices for quarterly periods since October 1, 2021. Power prices are the most significant cost driver for our wholly owned locations, and energy costs represented 51.5% and 19.6% of bitcoin mining revenues for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For our co-locations, hosting fees (which comprise direct operating costs of the third-party operator with energy as the largest cost) and profit sharing were a combined 66.9% and 42.4% of bitcoin mining revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Energy prices can be highly volatile and global events (including the war in Ukraine and the resulting natural gas shortage) have caused power prices to increase nationwide over the past year. All of our wholly owned and operated sites in the State of Georgia and our hosted miners in New York State are currently subject to variable prices and market rate fluctuations with respect to wholesale power costs. Such prices are governed by power purchase agreements which vary by location and said prices can change hour to hour. While this renders energy prices less predictable, it also gives us greater ability and flexibility to actively manage the energy we consume with an eye towards increasing profitability and energy efficiency. Energy prices are also highly sensitive to weather events, such as heat waves, winter storms and polar vortices, which increase the demand for power regionally. When such events occur, we may curtail our operations to avoid using power at increased rates. The average power prices we paid in our 45 owned facilities for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $0.048 and $0.041 per kilowatt hour, respectively. At our hosting facilities, the hosting fee as compared to KWHs utilized in the hosted facilities was $0.064 and $0.098 per kilowatt hour for such periods, respectively. The management team makes real-time determinations on the need and timing during which we should curtail energy use. We curtail when power prices exceed the value we would receive for the corresponding fixed bitcoin reward. This means if bitcoin’s value decreases or energy prices increase, our curtailment will increase; likewise, when bitcoin’s value increases and energy prices decrease, our curtailment will decrease. The management team manages this decision on an hour-by-hour basis across all our sites, both wholly owned and hosted. In the quarter ended December 31, 2022, energy prices spiked nationwide due to weather events and, as a result, we curtailed a total of 15% of our fleet, with December being the month in fiscal year 2023 with the greatest curtailment. Our active curtailment strategy allowed us to avoid excessive cost during these events, but it also resulted in decreased production. During the remainder of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not have significant curtailment due to weather events or energy price spikes. Results of Operations Bitcoin mining revenue We earned $168,121 in revenues during the year ended September 30, 2023, which was an increase of $37,121, or 28%, as compared with $131,000 in revenues for the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to increase in revenues from our bitcoin mining operations. Bitcoin mining revenues are determined by two main drivers: quantity of bitcoin mined and the price of bitcoin on the date the bitcoin is mined. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we mined 6,903 bitcoins with an average bitcoin price of $24,355 as compared to 3,752 bitcoins with an average bitcoin price of $34,916 during the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in the quantity of bitcoin mined was primarily driven by the increased number of miners in operation which almost doubled to approximately 88,000 as of September 30, 2023 from 47,000 as of September 30, 2022. This increase in miners in operation increased our hashrate, which is our total computational power, and which when understood in the context of global hashrate, determines how much bitcoin we are able to mine. Other services revenues Other services revenues pertain to our data center operations for which we earned $287 in revenue from our data center operation for the year ended September 30, 2023, which is a decrease of $238, or 45% as compared to $525 for the year ended September 30, 2022. This decrease was due to management's decision to divert all capacity within its operations to bitcoin mining. As of September 30, 2023, we no longer recognize revenues from data center operations. Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense) Our cost of revenues were $93,580 for the year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $52,346, or 127%, as compared with cost of revenues of $41,234 for the year ended September 30, 2022. These costs were primarily related to energy costs to operate the mining equipment within our owned facilities, which was $65,824 for the year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $52,490 as compared to $13,334 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increases in energy costs within our owned facilities relates to the full-year or approximate full-year, as applicable, of mining operations in fiscal year 2023 in our Washington and Sandersville locations which were acquired in August 2022 and October 2022, respectively. We also incurred hosting fees of $22,974 and profit sharing fees of $3,991 for the year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $266 and a decrease of $37, respectively, as compared to $22,708 and $4,028, respectively for the year ended September 30, 2022. The hosting fees and profit sharing fees are primarily the result of our co-location agreement with Coinmint. The hosting fees remained consistent for both fiscal years since the increase in KWHs utilized was offset by the decrease in the rate charged per KWH. 46 Professional fees Professional fees, which consists primarily of legal, accounting and consulting fees, were $10,869 for the year ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $4,400, or 68%, from $6,469 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Legal expenses were $7,676 for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $2,714 in the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to $3,800 in litigation settlement with Darfon America Corp and additional activity in litigation and transactional costs. Other professional fees, namely accounting, audit and consulting, were $3,193 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $3,755 for the year ended September 30, 2022, a decrease of $562. Payroll expenses Payroll expenses increased to $45,714 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $40,920 for the same period ended September 30, 2022. Our payroll expenses include all compensation related expenses for our employees and mainly includes salaries, wages, payroll-related taxes and benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation. Payroll expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation, were $21,572 the year ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 127% from $9,493 in the prior year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the Company’s acquisition of both WAHA and Mawson in August 2022 and October 2022, respectively. We grant stock-based awards to certain employees as a significant portion of our payroll-related costs. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, was $24,142 for the year ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $7,324, or 23%, from $31,466 the prior year ended September 30, 2022. General and administrative expenses General and administrative fees increased to $20,823 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $10,423 for the same period ended September 30, 2022, representing an increase of $10,400. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in corporate overhead, including but not limited to, taxes and licenses, insurance premiums, travel expenses and rent expenses. Other impairment expense (related to bitcoin) Impairment expense in the amount of $7,163 was recognized for the year ended September 30, 2023 a decrease of $5,047 as compared to $12,210 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The impairment expense consists of bitcoin impairments due to the general decrease in bitcoin prices during the year, for which there was a larger general decrease in bitcoin prices during fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Decreases in bitcoin prices for periods subsequent to the mining date are recorded as impairment expense. Impairment expense is measured utilizing the intraday low bitcoin price during the holding period of bitcoin. ASC Topic 350 - Goodwill and Other that requires subsequent increases in bitcoin prices are not allowed to be recorded (unrealized gains) unless the bitcoin is sold, at which point the gain is recognized. Realized gain on sale of bitcoin Realized gain on sale of bitcoin decreased to $1,357 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from a realized gain of $2,567 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Realized gains on sale of bitcoin is the difference between the sales proceeds of bitcoin and the carrying amount. Typically gains are higher when bitcoin prices are increasing over a holding period. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $120,728 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $49,045 for the same period ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $71,683. 47 Depreciation expense increased by $71,533, or 152%, during the year ended September 30, 2023, to $118,615 from $47,082 due to an increase in miners and mining-related equipment being placed in service during the comparative period. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company purchased Antminer XPs (140 TH/s with 21.5 J/TH), and replaced certain less efficient miners with these newly acquired miners. As a result, the Company recognized an additional $32,721 in accelerated depreciation expense on the replaced miners. Amortization expense for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $2,113, an increase of $150, or 8%, from $1,963 for the prior year ended September 30, 2022. Other Income (Expenses) Other expense was $260 for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared with $2,225 for the year ended September 30, 2022, which is a variance of $1,965. We recognized a gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration of $2,484 for the year ended September 30, 2023 relating to the Mawson acquisition. Unrealized loss on derivative security of $259 was recorded for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to loss for the same prior year period of $1,950. Interest expense in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 also increased by $1,899 to $2,977 from $1,078 in the prior year comparable period. This increase was primarily related to the Financing Agreement, which was issued in April 2022 and was outstanding for approximately five months in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to being outstanding during the entire fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Net Loss from Continuing Operations Net loss from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $132,160 as compared to net loss of $40,089 for the year ended September 30, 2022 for the reasons discussed above. Results of Discontinued Operations Revenues from our former energy segment decreased year over year as expected to $158 from $9,667. The total costs and expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased to $6,071 from $26,901 for the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to impairment expenses related to the energy business and severance-related payroll expenses recognized in the prior year. As a result, the net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased to $4,429 from $17,237 in the prior year ended September 30, 2022. The Company does not expect any substantial activity to be recorded to discontinued operations in subsequent periods. Net Loss Net loss for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $136,589, an increase of $79,263 compared to a net loss of $57,326 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Non-GAAP Measure We present adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). Our non-GAAP ""Adjusted EBITDA"" excludes (i) impacts of interest, taxes, and depreciation; (ii) our share-based compensation expense, unrealized gains/losses on securities, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration with respect to previously completed acquisitions, all of which are non-cash items that we believe are not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) non-cash impairment losses related to long-lived assets (including goodwill); (iv) realized gains and losses on sales of equity securities, the amounts of which are directly related to the unrealized gains and losses that are also excluded; (v) legal fees related to litigation and various transactions, which fees management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing operating activities; (vi) gains and losses on disposal of assets, the majority of which are related to obsolete or unrepairable machines that are no longer deployed; (vii) gains and losses related to discontinued operations that would not be applicable to our future business activities; and (viii) severance expenses. 48 We previously excluded non-cash impairment losses related to bitcoin and realized gains and losses on sales of bitcoin from our calculation of adjusted EBITDA but have determined such items are part of our normal ongoing operations and will no longer be excluding them from our calculation of adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these items allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies, and provides the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time. In addition to management's internal use of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, management believes that adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management believes the foregoing to be the case even though some of the excluded items involve cash outlays and some of them recur on a regular basis (although management does not believe any of such items are normal operating expenses necessary to generate our bitcoin related revenues). For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers and directors. Additionally, management does not consider any of the excluded items to be expenses necessary to generate our bitcoin-related revenue. The Company's adjusted EBITDA measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. The Company's adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating (loss) income or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Although management utilizes internally and presents adjusted EBITDA, we only utilize that measure supplementally and do not consider it to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in isolation of, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure (i.e., net (loss) income) for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended September 30, ($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA Net loss $ (136,589 ) $ (57,326 ) Loss on discontinued operations 4,429 17,237 Impairment expense - other — 250 Impairment expense - goodwill — 12,048 Depreciation and amortization 120,728 49,045 Share-based compensation expense 24,142 31,466 Other income (11 ) (308 ) Change in fair value of contingent consideration (2,484 ) (306 ) Realized gain on sale of equity security — (1 ) Unrealized loss of equity security — 2 Unrealized loss of derivative security 259 1,950 Interest income (481 ) (190 ) Interest expense 2,977 1,078 Loss (gain) on disposal of assets 1,931 (643 ) Income tax expense 857 — Legal fees related to litigation & settlement related expenses 7,872 522 Legal fees related to financing & business development transactions 697 827 Severance expenses 701 405 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA* $ 25,028 $ 56,056 49 The following is a reconciliation of the fair market value of our bitcoin holdings to the current carrying value at September 30, 2023 and 2022: September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Carrying Value (1) Fair Market Value (2) Carrying Value (1) Fair Market Value (2) Number of bitcoins held 2,243 2,243 595 595 Value per bitcoin (1) (2) $ 25,075 $ 26,961 $ 18,735 $ 19,426 Total $ 56,241 $ 60,471 $ 11,147 $ 11,559 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, capital expenditures, loan payments, public company costs and general corporate needs. We expect these needs to continue as we further develop and grow our business. For the year ended September 30, 2023, our primary sources of liquidity came from existing cash and cash equivalents and bitcoin. Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and bitcoin, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months and for the reasonably foreseeable future until we reach profitability, and we are not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in a decrease in liquidity of our assets. We are likely to require additional capital to respond to technological advancements, competitive dynamics or technologies, business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and in either the short-term or long-term may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In particular, rising inflation and interest rates, and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption and volatility in the global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital. If we are unable to raise additional funds when or on the terms desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. As of September 30, 2023, we had total current assets of $102,172, primarily consisting of cash and cash equivalents, bitcoin, inventory, and prepaid expenses and other current assets, and total assets in the amount of $761,578. Our total current liabilities and total liabilities as of September 30, 2023 were $74,055 and $84,351, respectively. We had a working capital of $28,117 as of September 30, 2023. In addition, we have access to equity financing through our at-the-market offering facility and debt financing through the lending arrangement we entered into in April 2022. Material Cash Requirements We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023, while others are considered future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to purchase goods or services, primarily miners and equipment, entered into in the normal course of business, loans and both finance and operating leases. We regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our business, including through potential acquisitions of businesses or assets. We will evaluate a variety of sources of capital in connection with financing any future possible acquisitions, including the incurrence of debt, sales of stock or bitcoin, or using cash on hand. We may also use the Company’s stock as transaction consideration, as we have done in the past. For information regarding our contractual obligations, see Contractual Obligations below and refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies included elsewhere in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 Operating Activities from Continuing Operations Net cash used in operating activities was $31,720 for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $77,806 for the same period ended September 30, 2022. Our proceeds from the sale of bitcoin of $116,271 and adding back non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization of $120,728, stock-based compensation of $24,142 and impairment of bitcoin of $7,163 were the main components of net cash provided by operating activity for the year ended September 30, 2023, offset primarily by the net cash used in operating activities of bitcoin mining of $168,121, net loss of $136,589, and increase in prepaid and other current assets of $4,320. Our net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by net loss from continuing operations for the period of $40,089, bitcoin mining of $131,000, and unrealized gain on derivative asset of $1,950, offset by stock based compensation of $31,466, depreciation and amortization of $49,045, impairment of bitcoin of $12,210, proceeds from the sale of bitcoin of $133,201, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $16,040. Cash provided by operating activities decreased significantly primarily due to an increase in the number of bitcoin held as of the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to as of the year ended September 30, 2022. Investing Activities from Continuing Operations Cash flows used by investing activities during the year ended September 30, 2023 was $334,179 as compared with $210,981 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Our payments on miner equipment purchase and deposits of $239,416, purchase of fixed assets of $61,460, purchase of Mawson of $22,518, purchase of Coinmaker LLC of $9,389, and land acquisition in Sandersville, GA of $1,430 were the main components of our investing cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2023. Our purchase of fixed assets of $19,286, payments on mining equipment (including deposits) of $171,181 and purchase of WAHA of $19,772 were the main components of our negative investing cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2022. Financing Activities from Continuing Operations Cash flows generated by financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2023 amounted to $371,075, as compared with $141,960 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of proceeds from our at-the-market offering facility of $383,776 (98,829,525 shares at a weighted average price of $3.88 per share). Our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 consisted of $125,048 in proceeds from offerings (17,740,081 shares at a weighted average price of $7.05 per share), and proceeds from equipment backed loan of $19,620. Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations Cash provided by discontinued operations was based on the winding down of operations, which includes receipt of payments from accounts receivable, payments of accounts payable and cash generated from the sale of assets during the fiscal year September 30, 2023. In fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we experienced significant cash outflows from our energy segment, which is a significant reason the Company decided to exit the energy business segment. The cash used in the operating activities of the energy segment (discontinued operations) for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $6,362. Recently Issued and Proposed Accounting Pronouncements At its September 6, 2023 meeting, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) discussed feedback on its proposed ASU - Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) on the accounting for and disclosure of certain crypto assets. On the basis of comments received on the proposal, the FASB directed its staff to draft a final standard. Under the new guidance, an entity would be required to subsequently measure certain crypto assets at fair value, with changes in fair value included in net income in each reporting period. The proposes set of rules would: 51 The proposed rules would apply to all entities, including employee benefit plans and not-for-profits. Crypto assets would be defined narrowly and bitcoin would meet the definition. The likelihood of a final standard before the end of the year is likely and early adoption would be permitted. Transition would not be retrospective but would require a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. The Company expects to early adopt the final standard when issued. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. This new guidance is effective for the Company for its interim and fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on October 1, 2020 (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model that reflects expected credit losses, including credit losses related to trade receivables, and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates, which generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. As the Company was a smaller reporting company at the time of issuance of the ASU, the Company adopted the ASU effective October 1, 2023, and the adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. The Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023 however we consider our critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition, property and equipment, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, bitcoin, and stock-based compensation. Our significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company’s goodwill impairments and estimations of recoverability for long-lived assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CleanSpark, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)and our report dated December 1, 2023 expressed an adverse opinion. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that responds to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion F- 1 on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Evaluation of the Accounting for and Disclosure of Bitcoin Mining Revenue Recognized As disclosed in Note 2, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company provides computing power to its mining pool and in exchange for providing such computing power, the Company is entitled to a pro-rata share of the fixed bitcoin awards earned over the measurement period, plus a pro-rata fractional share of the global transaction fee rewards for the respective measurement period, less net digital asset fees due to the mining pool operator over the measurement period. The Company’s pro-rata share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator as compared to the bitcoin network’s algorithmic difficulty. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized net bitcoin mining revenue of approximately $168.1 million. The Company’s management has exercised significant judgment in their determination of how existing GAAP should be applied to the accounting for and disclosure of bitcoin mining revenue recognized. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: Evaluation of the Accounting for and Disclosure of Bitcoin Held As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, bitcoin held by the Company as of September 30, 2023, are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and have been included in current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s bitcoin as of September 30, 2023 amounted to approximately $56.2 million. The Company’s management has exercised significant judgment in their determination of how existing GAAP should be applied to the accounting for bitcoin held, the associated financial statement presentation and accompanying footnote disclosures. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: /s/ MaloneBailey, LLP www.malonebailey.com We have served as the Company's auditor since 2018. Houston, Texas December 1, 2023 F- 2 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of CleanSpark, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of CleanSpark, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the Company after the date of management’s assessment. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 and for the years then ended and our report dated December 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (“Management’s Report”). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment: the Company did not adequately design and maintain effective general information technology controls over third-party information systems and applications that are relevant to the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2023 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report on those financial statements. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance F- 3 with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ MaloneBailey, LLP www.malonebailey.com We have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.

F- 12 CLEANSPARK, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ($ in thousands, except per share amounts) 1. ORGANIZATION AND LINE OF BUSINESS Organization CleanSpark is a bitcoin mining company. The Company independently owns and operates five data centers in Georgia for a total developed capacity of 230 MW. The Company is developing an additional 150 MW at its data center in Sandersville, GA. The Company does not currently host miners for any other companies. A partner in Massena, NY, hosts 50 MW for the Company. CleanSpark designs its infrastructure to responsibly support bitcoin, the world’s most important digital commodity and an essential tool for financial independence and inclusion. Lines of Business Bitcoin Mining Business Through CleanSpark, Inc., and the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, ATL Data Centers LLC (“ATL”), CleanBlok, Inc. (“CleanBlok”), CleanSpark DW, LLC, and CleanSpark GLP, LLC, the Company mines bitcoin. The Company entered the bitcoin mining industry through its acquisition of ATL in December 2020. It acquired a second data center in August 2021 and has had a co-location agreement with New York-based Coinmint, LLC in place since July 2021. Bitcoin mining has now become the Company’s principal revenue generating business activity. The Company currently intends to acquire additional facilities, equipment and infrastructure capacity to continue to expand our bitcoin mining operations. Through the Company’s subsidiaries CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, CSRE Property Management Company, LLC, CSRE Properties, LLC, CSRE Properties Washington, LLC, CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC, CSRE Properties Dalton, LLC, and CleanSpark HQ, LLC, the Company maintains real property holdings. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Liquidity The accompanying audited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and have been filed with the SEC on December 1, 2023 (“Form 10-K”). As shown in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $ 132,160 and $ 40,089 during the years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. While the Company has experienced negative cash flows from investing activities due to its continued investments in capital expenditures in support of its bitcoin mining operations, it has generated positive cash flows from financing activities in fiscal year 2023. The Company used $ 31,720 in cash from its operations for fiscal 2023, however, the Company made a decision to sell fewer bitcoin than it generated and the increase in bitcoin held at the end of the year (for which the Company classifies as a current asset) was $ 56,241 . The Company has sufficient working capital to support its ongoing operations for the next twelve months. In addition, the Company has access to equity financing through its at-the-market (""ATM"") offering facility (see Note 12 - Stockholders' Equity). As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company had working capital of $ 28,117 and $ 16,735 , respectively. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CleanSpark, Inc., and the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, ATL, CleanBlok, CleanSpark DW, LLC, CleanSpark GLP, LLC, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, CSRE Property Management Company, LLC, CSRE Properties, LLC, CSRE Properties Washington, LLC, CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC, CSRE Properties Dalton, LLC, and CleanSpark HQ, LLC. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities. As of June 30, 2022, the Company deemed its energy operations to be discontinued operations due to its strategic shift to strictly focus on its bitcoin mining operations and divest of its energy assets. The disposal groups related to the F- 13 energy operations are part of the following entities: CleanSpark LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems Inc., GridFabric, LLC, Solar Watt Solutions, Inc, and CleanSpark II, LLC. Liquidity The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue in operation one year after the date these financial statements are issued and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The evaluation of going concern under the accounting guidance requires significant judgment which involves the Company to consider that it has historically incurred losses in recent years as it has prepared to grow its business through expansion and acquisition opportunities. The Company must also consider its current liquidity as well as future market and economic conditions that may be deemed outside the control of the Company as it relates to obtaining financing and generating future profits. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $ 29,215 available cash on-hand and bitcoin with a fair market value of $ 56,241 . After considering its current liquidity and future market and economic conditions, the Company has concluded there is no substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company’s goodwill impairment, intangible assets acquired, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, valuation of derivative assets and liabilities, available-for-sale investments, allowances for uncollectible accounts, valuation of contingent consideration, and the valuations of share based awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the Financial Accounting Standard Board's (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, which requires that five steps be followed in evaluating revenue recognition: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identity the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfied a performance obligation. Our accounting policy on revenue recognition for our bitcoin mining segment (sole reporting unit as of September 2023 and 2022) by type of revenue is provided below. Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Revenue from Bitcoin Mining The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle: F- 14 Step 1: The Company enters into a contract with a bitcoin mining pool operator (i.e., the customer) to provide computing power to the mining pools. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and the Company’s enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company starts providing computing power to the mining pool operator (which occurs daily at midnight Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)). In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a pro-rata share of the fixed bitcoin awards earned over the measurement period, plus a pro-rata fractional share of the global transaction fee rewards for the respective measurement period, less net digital asset fees due to the mining pool operator over the measurement period. The Company’s pro-rata share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator as compared to the bitcoin network’s algorithmic difficulty. The proportionate share of the transaction fee rewards earned are based on the Company’s computing power as compared to the total computing power contributed to the global network. Applying the criteria per ASC 606-10-25-1, the contract arises at the point that the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator, which is beginning contract day at midnight UTC (contract inception), because customer consumption is in tandem with daily earnings of delivery of the computing power. Step 2 : In order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606’s definition of a “distinct” good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: Based on these criteria, the Company has a single performance obligation in providing computing power services (i.e., hashrate) to the mining pool operator (i.e., customer). The performance obligation of computing power services is fulfilled daily over-time, as opposed to a point in time, because the Company provides the hashrate throughout the day and the customer simultaneously obtains control of it and uses the asset to produce bitcoin. The Company has full control of the mining equipment utilized in the mining pool and if the Company determines it will increase or decrease the processing power of its machines and/or fleet (i.e., for repairs or when power costs are excessive) the computing power provided to the customer will be reduced. Step 3 : The transaction consideration the Company earns is non-cash digital consideration in the form of bitcoin, which the Company measures at fair value on the date earned at the daily closing price, which is not materially different from the fair value at contract inception, which is the daily opening price. According to the customer contract, daily earnings are calculated from midnight-to-midnight UTC time, and the sub-account balance is credited one hour later at 1:00 AM UTC time. The Company utilizes Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which is also the midnight of UTC time, since this is consistent with our customer contract in calculating our daily earnings from midnight-to-midnight UTC time. The transaction consideration the Company earns is all variable since it is dependent on the daily computing power provided by the Company. The Company’s bitcoins earned through the contractual payout formula is not known until the Company’s computational hashrate contributed over the daily measurement period is fulfilled over-time daily between midnight-to-midnight UTC time. The Company’s proportionate amount of the global network transaction fee rewards earned are calculated at the end of each transactional day (midnight to midnight). There are no other forms of variable considerations, such as discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties, or other similar items. The Company fully constrains all variable consideration as a result of ASC 606-10-32-12a because the amount of consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside of our control as defined by the Company’s customer’s payout methodology. The variable consideration is constrained until the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of mining rewards by the end of a given transactional day based on the actual amount of computing power provided to the mining pool operators. By then, the Company considers it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenues will not occur and includes such variable consideration in the transaction price. Step 4 : The transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation upon verification for the provision of computing power to the mining pool operator. There is a single performance obligation (i.e., computing power or F- 15 hashrate) for the contract; therefore, all consideration from the mining pool operator is allocated to this single performance obligation. Step 5 : The Company’s performance is complete in transferring the hashrate service over-time (midnight to midnight) to the customer and the customer obtains control of that asset. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a pro-rata share of the fixed bitcoin awards earned over the measurement period, plus a pro-rata fractional share of the global transaction fee rewards for the respective measurement period, less net digital asset fees due to the mining pool operator over the measurement period, as applicable. The transaction consideration the Company receives is non-cash consideration, in the form of bitcoin. The Company measures the bitcoin at fair value on the date earned using the closing price of bitcoin on the date earned (midnight UTC). There are no deferred revenues or other liability obligations recorded by the Company since there are no payments in advance of the performance. At the end of the 24 hour “midnight-to-midnight” period, there are no remaining performance obligations. Revenues from data center services The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary ATL, previously provided data services, such as providing its customers with rack space, power and equipment, and cloud services, such as virtual services, virtual storage, and data backup services, generally based on monthly services provided at a defined price included in the contracts. The performance obligations are the services provided to a customer for the month based on the contract. The transaction price is the price agreed with the customer for the monthly services provided and the revenues are recognized monthly based on the services rendered for the month. The total revenue recognized from data center services for the years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 is $ 287 and $ 525 , respectively. As of September 30, 2023, data center services are no longer provided to external customers. Cost of Revenues Bitcoin mining segment (sole reportable segment) The Company includes energy costs and external co-location mining hosting fees in cost of revenues. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in banks. None of the Company’s cash was restricted as of September 30, 2023 or September 30, 2022 . Accounts receivable Accounts receivable is comprised of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms. They are initially recorded at the invoiced amount upon the sale of goods or services to customers, and do not bear interest. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and management closely monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reviewed periodically for collectability. If management determines that collection is unlikely, an allowance that reflects management’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected is recorded. Accounts receivable, net consists of the following: ($ in thousands) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Accounts Receivable, gross $ 353 $ 247 Provision for doubtful allowances ( 348 ) ( 220 ) Total Accounts Receivable, net $ 5 $ 27 F- 16 Inventory Inventory balances mainly include supplies inventory used to maintain bitcoin mining facilities and are presented at net realizable value with cost being measured on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company periodically reviews inventories for unusable and obsolete items. Based on this evaluation, provisions are made to write inventories down to their net realizable value. Prepaid expense and other current assets The Company records a prepaid expense for costs paid but not yet incurred. Those expected to be incurred within one year are recognized and shown as a short-term pre-paid expense. Any costs expected to be incurred outside of one year would be considered other long-term assets. Other current assets are assets that consist of supplies, deposits, and interest receivable. Deposits and interest we expect to receive within one year are shown as short-term. Those we expect to receive outside of one year are shown as other long-term assets. Bitcoin Bitcoin are included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets due to the Company’s ability to sell it in a highly liquid marketplace and its intent to liquidate its bitcoin to support operations when needed. Bitcoin is recorded at cost less impairment. They are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other, and are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition policy detailed above and in this Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In testing for impairment of bitcoin, the Company does not perform a qualitative assessment as allowed under ASC350-30-35-18A, and therefore goes directly to the quantitative assessment at the end of each reporting period. Quantitative impairment is measured using the lowest recognized selling price of the bitcoin at the time its fair value is being measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. Quoted prices are obtained from the Company's principal market (Coinbase). To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted as per ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. Bitcoin earned by the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The sales of bitcoin are included within operating activities as the Company sells its bitcoin within a short period of time subsequent to the mining of such bitcoin. The Company will evaluate time periods when the Company holds bitcoin for a longer period of time and sale so such would be recorded as investing activities. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , all cash proceeds received from sale of bitcoin were classified as operating cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. Any realized gains or losses from such sales are included in total costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the ""first-in, first-out"" method of accounting. Investment securities Investment securities include debt securities and equity securities. Debt securities are classified as available for sale (“AFS”) and are reported as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their estimated fair value. As the fair values of AFS debt securities change, the changes are reported net of income tax as an element of OCI, except for other-than-temporarily-impaired securities. When AFS debt securities are sold, the unrealized gains or losses are reclassified from OCI to non-interest income. Securities classified as AFS are securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sell a security classified as AFS would be based on various factors, including significant movements in interest rates, changes in the maturity mix of the Company’s assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, decline in credit quality, and regulatory capital considerations. Interest income is recognized based on the coupon rate and increased by accretion of discounts earned or decreased by the amortization of premiums paid over the contractual life of the security. F- 17 For individual debt securities where the Company either intends to sell the security or more likely than not will not recover all of its amortized cost, OTTI (other than temporary impairment) is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. For individual debt securities for which a credit loss has been recognized in earnings, interest accruals and amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts are suspended when the credit loss is recognized. Interest received after accruals have been suspended is recognized in income on a cash basis. The Company holds investments in both publicly held and privately held equity securities. However, as described in Note 1, the Company is primarily doing business of in the bitcoin mining sector, and not in the business of investing in securities. Privately held equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment. All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized or unrealized, are recorded through gains or losses on equity securities on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Publicly held equity securities are based on fair value accounting with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as unrealized gains or losses on equity securities in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Concentration Risk At times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (""FDIC"") limits. The cash balance in excess of the FDIC limits was $ 28,965 and $ 20,213 for the periods ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The accounts offered by the custodian of the Company’s bitcoin, which totaled $ 56,241 and $ 11,147 as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively, are not insured by the FDIC. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company has certain customers and vendors who individually represented 10 % or more of the Company’s revenue or capital expenditures. In fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 , revenue is concentrated with one mining pool operator and all bitcoins reside in one exchange. Refer to Note 16 - Major Customers and Vendors. Leases In accordance with ASC 842, the Company assesses whether an arrangement contains a lease at contract inception. When an arrangement contains a lease, the Company categorizes leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in “Fixed Assets, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases. The Company records right-of use (""ROU"") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments. Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Some leases include multiple year renewal options. The Company’s decision to exercise these renewal options is based on an assessment of its current business needs and market factors at the time of the renewal. Currently, the Company has no leases for which the option to renew is reasonably certain and therefore, options to renew were not factored into the calculation of its right of use asset and lease liability as of September 30, 2023. For all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. F- 18 Stock-based compensation The Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10 Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company may issue compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management, accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services. The Company determines the grant date fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For equity awards granted by the Company that are contingent upon market-based conditions, the Company fair values these awards using the Monte Carlo simulation model. For discussion of accounting for restricted stock units (""RSUs""), please refer Note 14 – Stock-Based Compensation. Loss per share The Company reports loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10 “Earnings Per Share,” which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 , there were 300,698 and 7,069,706 , respectively, units of common stock equivalents that consist of options, warrants, and restricted stock units, as well as 5,250,000 shares issuable upo n preferred stock conversions, that were excluded from the current and prior period diluted loss per share calculation as their effect is anti-dilutive. Provided below is the loss per share calculation for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: F- 19 For the Year Ended September 30, ($ in thousands, except share and per share) 2023 2022 Continuing Operations Numerator Loss from continuing operations $ ( 132,160 ) $ ( 40,089 ) Preferred stock dividends — 336 Loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders $ ( 132,160 ) $ ( 40,425 ) Denominator Weighted- average common shares outstanding, basic 102,707,509 42,614,197 Dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards — — Dilutive impact of contingent shares issued for business acquisition — — Weighted- average common shares outstanding, diluted 102,707,509 42,614,197 Loss from continuing operations per common share attributable to common shareholders Basic $ ( 1.29 ) $ ( 0.95 ) Diluted $ ( 1.29 ) $ ( 0.95 ) Discontinued Operations Numerator Loss on discontinued operations $ ( 4,429 ) $ ( 17,237 ) Denominator Weighted- average common shares outstanding, basic 102,707,509 42,614,197 Dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards — — Dilutive impact of contingent shares issued for business acquisition — — Weighted- average common shares outstanding, diluted 102,707,509 42,614,197 Loss on discontinued operations per common share attributable to common shareholders Basic $ ( 0.04 ) $ ( 0.40 ) Diluted $ ( 0.04 ) $ ( 0.40 ) Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Construction in progress is the construction or development of assets that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use. Depreciation for machinery and equipment, mining equipment, buildings, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for its intended use. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: F- 20 Useful life (years) Land improvements 5 - 15 Building and building improvements Shorter of lease term or 30 years Leasehold improvements ﻿ Shorter of lease term or 15 years Miners 3 - 5 Mining equipment 3 - 15 Infrastructure asset Shorter of lease term or 15 years Machinery and equipment 3 - 10 Furniture and fixtures 1 - 5 In accordance with the FASB ASC 360-10, ""Property, Plant and Equipment” the carrying value of property and equipment, and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. During the years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 the Company did not record an impairment expense for assets within its continuing operations. In connection with property and equipment in our discontinued operations, an impairment expense in the approximate amount of $ 32 was recognized in fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and included in loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Business combinations, Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, where the total purchase price is allocated to the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The difference between the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration transferred is initially recognized at fair value. Contingent consideration classified as a liability or an asset is remeasured to fair value each period until settlement, with changes recognized in profit or loss. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured. Acquisition-related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred. The Company reviews its indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In accordance with its policies, the Company performed an assessment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill for the year end September 30, 2023. During the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred the following impairment losses: ($ in thousands) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Impairment of bitcoin $ 7,163 $ 12,210 Impairment of goodwill — 12,048 Total impairment loss $ 7,163 $ 24,258 2023 Goodwill Impairment analysis In accordance with ASC 350-30-35-18A, an entity may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test, and has the unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative analysis. In completing the 2023 annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company elected to perform a quantitative assessment for our goodwill. The assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the entity, including goodwill, to its estimated fair value. In accordance with ASU 2017-04, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value F- 21 unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. In determining the fair value for which the quantitative assessment was performed, the Company engaged a valuation specialist to perform the quantitative impairment analysis. The valuation report included a combination of the market and income approach to test for goodwill impairment. The income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. Using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, revenue is projected and applied to fixed and variable cost experience rates to arrive at the future cash flows. A terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream. Future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. The discount rate used was the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. In determining the estimated fair value, several factors were estimated, including projected operating results, growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows and the discount rate. The market valuation approach evaluated the company's market value as compared to the net asset balance. The fiscal year 2023 assessment indicated that no impairment of goodwill was necessary. In completing the 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis, there was an impairment recognized. In fiscal 2022, there was a sustained downturn in the price of bitcoin which resulted in the carrying value of the Company's goodwill to exceed the fair value. The following table reflects goodwill activity for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively: ($ in thousands) For the year ended September 30, 2023 2022 Balance at beginning of Fiscal Year $ — $ 12,048 New Acquisitions 8,043 — Impairment — ( 12,048 ) Balance at end of Fiscal Year $ 8,043 $ — The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives, which range between two and twenty years as follows: Useful life (years) Websites 3 Software 4 - 7 Strategic contract 5 Fair Value Measurement of financial instruments, derivative asset and contingent consideration Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable. Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices included for identical or similar assets and liabilities that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. These are typically obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments. F- 22 Level 3 Unobservable inputs, where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect the reporting entity’s own beliefs about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available in the circumstances. The carrying value of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term portion of loan payable approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company's long-term portion of loan payable is also stated at fair value since the stated rate of interest approximates market rates. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The following table presents the Company’s financial instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis, and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022: September 30, 2023: September 30, 2023 ($ in thousands) Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Derivative investment asset $ 2,697 $ — $ — $ 2,697 Investment in debt security 726 — — 726 Total $ 3,423 $ — $ — $ 3,423 September 30, 2022: September 30, 2022 ($ in thousands) Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Derivative investment asset $ 2,956 $ — $ — $ 2,956 Investment in debt security 610 — — 610 Total $ 3,566 $ — $ — $ 3,566 There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The activities of the financial instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on the Company's balance sheets on a recurring basis during years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are included in Note 6 - Investments. Income taxes The Company’s calculation of its tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. The Company recognizes tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on management’s estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes will be required. The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. Deferred income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Temporary differences arise from net operating losses, differences in depreciation methods of archived images, and property and equipment, stock-based and other compensation, and other accrued expenses. A valuation allowance is established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S., or the various state jurisdictions, may be materially different from managements estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. Interest and penalties are included in tax expense. F- 23 The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the provision for income taxes. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Income tax expense/(benefit) from operations for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $ 0 and $ 0 in each period, which resulted primarily from maintaining a full valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets. Segment Reporting The Company determines its operating segments based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker views and evaluates operations, performance and allocates resources. Since June 30, 2022, the Company's only operating segment is the bitcoin mining business. Discontinued Operations The Company deemed its energy operations to be discontinued operations due to its strategic decision to strictly focus on its bitcoin mining operations and divest of the majority of its energy assets. Through its discontinued operations segment, the Company previously provided energy solutions through its wholly-owned subsidiaries CleanSpark LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc., GridFabric, LLC, and Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. These solutions consisted of engineering, design and software solutions, custom hardware solutions, Open Automated Demand response, solar, energy storage for microgrid and distributed energy systems. The Company has since sold the majority of its assets related to the Energy Segment, which included software and intellectual property, and inventory. See Note 3 – Discontinued Operations. Commitments and contingencies The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies and loss recoveries, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business. The Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as the Company’s ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available with its external and internal counsel to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed. Recently issued accounting pronouncements In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. This new guidance is effective for the Company for its fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is evaluating its potential impact but does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on October 1, 2020 (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model that reflects expected credit losses, including credit losses related to trade receivables, and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates, which generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. As the Company was a smaller reporting company at the time of issuance of the ASU, the Company adopted the ASU effective October 1, 2023, and adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. F- 24 In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),” which reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments will be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net income per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. The treasury stock method should no longer be used to calculate diluted net income per share for convertible instruments. The amendment was effective for the Company effective October 1, 2022, including interim periods. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures. 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The Company determined to make available for sale the asset groups related to its energy segment due to its strategic shift to strictly focus on its bitcoin mining operations. As a result, the energy segment's results of operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all periods presented. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of this segment are separately reported as “assets and liabilities held for sale” as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 in the consolidated balance sheets. The results of operations of this segment, for all periods, are separately reported as “discontinued operations” in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss . Provided below are the key areas of the financials that constitute the discontinued operations: September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 ASSETS Current assets Accounts receivable, net $ 126 $ 2,813 Inventory 319 4,400 Prepaid expense and other current assets — 213 Total current assets held for sale $ 445 $ 7,426 Property and equipment, net — 11 Operating lease right of use asset — 665 Intangible assets, net — 869 Long-term assets held for sale $ — $ 1,545 Total assets held for sale $ 445 $ 8,971 LIABILITIES Current liabilities Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 978 $ 919 Contract liabilities — 117 Operating lease liability 197 163 Total current liabilities held for sale 1,175 1,199 Long-term liabilities Operating lease liability, net of current portion — 512 Total liabilities held for sale $ 1,175 $ 1,711 F- 25 For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Revenues, net Energy hardware, software and services revenue $ 158 $ 9,667 Total revenues, net 158 9,667 Costs and expenses Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) 936 8,711 Professional fees 115 116 Payroll expenses 426 4,911 General and administrative expenses 413 1,641 Impairment expense - fixed assets — 32 Impairment expense - intangibles — 1,402 Impairment expense - other 4,181 872 Impairment expense - goodwill — 7,001 Depreciation and amortization — 2,215 Total costs and expenses 6,071 26,901 Loss from operations $ ( 5,913 ) $ ( 17,234 ) Other income (expense) Gain on disposal of assets 1,508 — Interest expense ( 24 ) ( 3 ) Total other income (expense) 1,484 ( 3 ) Loss before income tax (expense) benefit ( 4,429 ) ( 17,237 ) Income tax benefit (expense) — — Net loss attributable to common shareholders $ ( 4,429 ) $ ( 17,237 ) 4. ACQUISITIONS Coinmaker LLC Acquisition - Dalton, GA On June 21, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of two bitcoin mining facilities in Dalton, GA for $ 9,389 . Each of the facilities are located on separate one acre sites, each of which are under land leases. The combined facilities are able to currently utilize 20 megawatts of power and are expected to host a total of approximately 6,000 miners. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, whereby the total purchase price is allocated first to the fair value of the assets acquired and any excess purchase price is allocated to the acquired assets pro-rata. No goodwill is calculated in an asset acquisition. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price of the assets acquired are summarized below: ($ in thousands) Preliminary Allocation at Acquisition Date Land lease - right of use asset $ 266 Operating lease liability ( 266 ) Building 1,328 Infrastructure 8,061 Total purchase price $ 9,389 There have been no subsequent adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price after the preliminary allocation. F- 26 Mawson Infrastructure Group - Sandersville, GA On October 8, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of a lease for approximately 16.35 acres of real property located in Sandersville, Washington County, Georgia (the “Mawson Property”), all personal property located on the Mawson Property, and 6,349 application-specific integrated circuit miners (the “ASICs”) from subsidiaries of Mawson Infrastructure Group, Inc. a Delaware corporation (“Mawson”), all pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated September 8, 2022 and an Equipment Purchase and Sale Agreement dated September 8, 2022 (the ""Mawson Transaction""). The Company paid the following consideration to Mawson for the Mawson Property: (i) $ 13,500 in cash; (ii) 1,590,175 shares (the “Closing Shares”) of the Company's common stock (which had a value of $ 4,803 based upon the closing price of the common stock on October 7, 2022), and (iii) $ 6,500 in seller financing in the form of a promissory note. The Company also paid $ 9,018 in cash within 15 days of the closing for the ASICs. The following additional contingent consideration was included in the purchase price: The Company accounted for this transaction as an acquisition of a business. The fair value of the consideration given to Mawson and the other sellers in connection with the transaction and the allocation of the purchase price in accordance with ASC 820 were as follows: ($ in thousands) Fair Value Cash $ 22,518 Financing provided by seller 6,500 1,590,175 shares of CLSK common stock 4,803 Total purchase price $ 33,821 Contingent Consideration Earn-out Shares of CLSK common stock 3,325 Megawatt earnout (up to $ 2,000 max) 2,000 Total contingent consideration $ 5,325 Total purchase sale agreement consideration-Combined $ 39,146 F- 27 ($ in thousands) Allocation at Acquisition Date Right of use lease asset $ 5,010 Lease liability assumed ( 5,100 ) Building 13,654 Infrastructure asset 4,465 Miners 12,914 Machinery and equipment 160 Goodwill 8,043 Total $ 39,146 There were no subsequent adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price after the preliminary allocation. SPRE Commercial Group Inc. and WAHA Technologies Inc. - Washington, GA On August 17, 2022, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary CSRE Properties Washington, LLC, (“CSRE”), completed the purchase of real property, together with all improvements situated thereon and all rights, easements and appurtenances belonging thereto (collectively, the “Property”), from SPRE Commercial Group, Inc. f/k/a WAHA, Inc. (“SPRE”), (the “Seller”), pursuant to a Land Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of August 5, 2022 and amended on August 17, 2022. Additionally, on August 17, 2022, in connection with the Land Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Company completed the purchase of a mix of S19 and S19 J Pro bitcoin miners with a total processing power equal to approximately 341,985 terahashes, pursuant to an equipment purchase and sale agreement (together with the Land Purchase and Sale Agreement, the “Acquisition”), from Waha Technologies, Inc., a Georgia corporation (“WAHA”, collectively with the Seller, ""WAHA & SPRE"" or the ""Sellers""), an affiliate of the Seller. Pursuant to the Land Purchase and Sale Agreement and the Equipment Purchase and Sale Agreement the Company acquired substantially all of WAHA & SPRE's assets. The transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of a business. Total consideration for the Property and miners consisted of (i) $1,962 in financing provided by the Seller to the Company at an interest rate of 12% per annum, to be repaid in 12 monthly installments of $174, (ii) the Company’s assumption of a mortgage with a maximum principal amount of $2,158 and an interest rate of 13% and (iii) $19,772 of cash consideration paid by the Company to the Seller. Acquisition related costs of $118, consisting primarily of legal and recording fees, were expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 805 and are reflected in professional fees on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company determined the fair value of the consideration given to the Sellers in connection with the transaction and the allocation of the purchase price in accordance with ASC 820 were as follows: Consideration: ($ in thousands) Fair Value Cash $ 19,772 Financing provided by SPRE 1,962 Mortgage assumed 2,158 Total Consideration $ 23,892 Purchase Price Allocation: ($ in thousands) Allocation at Acquisition Date Land $ 100 Building/Improvements 14,700 Miners 9,092 Total $ 23,892 F- 28 The total purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets deemed acquired based on their estimated fair values. The fair values of the assets have been recorded and are reflected in property and equipment, net on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in this annual report. The useful life for the building and improvements is estimated to be 30 years consistent with the Company's policy. The useful life for miners was estimated to be 3 years consistent with the Company's policy for depreciating used miners. Land is not depreciated. Financing provided by the Seller and the mortgage assumed have been recorded as loans payable and are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pro forma of Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) The following is the unaudited pro forma information assuming the consummation of each of the Mawson Transaction and WAHA Transaction occurred on October 1, 2021: For the Year Ended ($ in thousands, except share and per share) September 30, 2022 Net sales from continuing operations $ 209,304 Loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders $ ( 33,758 ) Loss from continuing operations per common share - basic $ ( 0.75 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding – basic 45,305,262 Loss from continuing operations per common share - diluted $ ( 0.75 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding – diluted 45,305,262 Pro forma results of operations for the Mawson Transaction for the year ended September 30, 2023 were not presented since the Mawson Transaction occurred on October 8, 2022 and the results for the 8-day period would be immaterial. The WAHA Transaction was included during the entire year ended September 30, 2023.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information does not reflect any operating efficiencies and cost savings that may be realized from the integration of the acquisition. All transactions that would be considered inter-company transactions for pro forma purposes have been eliminated. 5. BITCOIN As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company held 2,243 and 595 bitcoin, respectively. The following table presents the activities of the Company's bitcoin holdings for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: ($ in thousands) For the year ended September 30, 2023 2022 Balance at beginning of Fiscal Year $ 11,147 $ 23,603 Addition of bitcoin 168,121 131,000 Carrying amount of bitcoin sold ( 114,915 ) ( 130,635 ) Bitcoin issued for services ( 720 ) ( 611 ) Bitcoin issued for software ( 229 ) — Impairment loss ( 7,163 ) ( 12,210 ) Balance at end of Fiscal Year $ 56,241 $ 11,147 F- 29 The Company's bitcoin holdings are not subject to rehypothecation and do not serve as collateral for any existing loans or agreements. As of September 30, 2023, the Company held 95 % of its bitcoin in cold storage and 5 % in hot wallets. 6. INVESTMENTS As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company had total investments of $ 3,423 and $ 3,566 , respectively, that comprise of the following: International Land Alliance, Inc. On November 5, 2019, the Company entered in a binding Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with International Land Alliance, Inc. (“ILAL”), a Wyoming corporation, to lay a foundational framework where the Company will deploy its energy solutions products and services to ILAL, its energy projects, and its customers. In connection with the MOU, and to support the power and energy needs of ILAL's development and construction of certain projects, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”), dated as of November 6, 2019, with ILAL. Investment in Debt Securities (Preferred Stock) and related Embedded Derivative Asset Pursuant to the terms of the SPA with ILAL, the Company purchased 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of ILAL (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price of $ 500 (the “Stock Transaction”), less certain expenses and fees. The Series B Preferred Stock accrue cumulative in-kind accruals at a rate of 12% per annum and were redeemable on August 6, 2020. The Series B Preferred Stock can be converted into common stock at a variable rate (refer the discussion on embedded derivative assets below). This variable conversion ratio will increase by 10% with the occurrence of certain events. Since the investments were not redeemed on August 6, 2020, they are now redeemable at the Company`s option in cash or into common stock, based on the conversion ratio. The Series B Preferred Stock is recorded as an AFS debt security and is reported at its estimated fair value as of September 30, 2023 . Any change in the fair values of AFS debt securities are reported net of income tax as an element of Other Comprehensive income. The Company accrued no interest (net of allowance) on our available-for-sale debt securities, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The fair value of our investment in debt securities is $ 726 and $ 610 as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company has included gain on fair value of preferred stock amounting to $ 116 and $ 115 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as part of other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company has deemed this variable conversion feature of ILAL preferred stock as an embedded derivative instrument in accordance with ASC Topic No. 815. This topic requires the Company to account for the conversion feature on its balance sheet at fair value and account for changes in fair value as a derivative gain or loss. Unrealized gain or loss on fair valuation of this embedded feature is recognized as an income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Total fair value of investment in Derivative assets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 is $ 2,697 and $ 2,956 , respectively. The Company fair values the debt security as a straight debt instrument based on liquidation value and accrued interest to date. The fair value of the derivative asset is based on the difference in the fair value of the debt security determined as a straight debt instrument and the fair value of the debt security if converted as of the reporting date. Commitment shares - Common stock of ILAL Pursuant to the terms of the SPA with ILAL, the Company received 350,000 shares (commitment shares) of ILAL's common stock. The commitment shares were fully earned at the time of execution of the agreement. The Company sold 334,611 shares at various prices and fair valued the remaining 15,389 shares at the closing stock price of ILAL F- 30 as of September 30, 2021. During the year ended September 30, 2022 , the Company sold 15,389 commitment shares, and recorded realized gain on sale of shares for $ 1 . Investment in Equity Securities - LawClerk In February 2020, the Company made a $ 250 strategic relationship investment in LawClerk for 200,000 Series A Preferred Shares of LawClerk. This investment is recorded on a cost basis and adjusted for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment. The Company annually performs impairment analysis on this investment and concluded that the investment was not recoverable and accordingly recorded an impairment of $ 250 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Refer the table below for a reconciliation of carrying value of all investments for the year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022: ($ in thousands) ILAL Debt Securities ILAL Derivative Asset ILAL Equity Securities Law Clerk Equity Securities Balance as of September 30, 2021 $ 494 $ 4,906 $ 11 $ 250 Shares sold during the year — — ( 10 ) — Realized gain on fair value recognized in other income (expense) — — 1 — Unrealized loss recognized in other income (expense) — ( 1,950 ) ( 2 ) — Impairment loss — — — ( 250 ) Unrealized gain on fair value recognized in Other comprehensive income 116 — — — Balance as of September 30, 2022 $ 610 $ 2,956 $ — $ — Unrealized loss on derivative asset — ( 259 ) Unrealized gain on fair value recognized in other comprehensive income 116 — — — Balance as of September 30, 2023 $ 726 $ 2,697 $ — $ — 7.

During the year ended September 30, 2023 , $ 1,966 of property and equipment was disposed of for a loss of $ 1,931 . F- 31 The Company placed in service property and equipment of $ 231,135 during the year ended September 30, 2023. This increase in fixed assets primarily consisted of miners and mining equipment amounting to $ 175,558 . On April 7, 2023, CleanSpark HQ, LLC (“HQLLC”), a single member limited liability company and subsidiary wholly owned by the Company, purchased certain real property located at 10424 South Eastern Ave., Suite 200, Henderson, Nevada (the ""Eastern Property"") for $ 4,100 . The property consists of approximately 15,000 square feet of office space. The Company intends to utilize this office space as its new corporate headquarters. The real property is recorded in construction in progress as of September 30, 2023, and includes an additional $ 560 in building improvements. The completion is expected to occur in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. On May 1, 2023, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale agreement with the Development Authority of Washington County to purchase 16.35 acres of land that was previously leased by the Company and an additional 10 acres of parcels in Sandersville, GA (""Sandersville Land"") for a purchase price of $ 1,300 (the agreement was subsequently amended in June 2023 to increase the purchase price to $ 1,400 ). The leased land had been subject to an operating lease which was acquired by the Company under the Mawson Transaction. In accordance with ASC 842-Leases, the Company reassessed the lease classification as a finance lease and recorded land at the present value of the lease term (net of the carrying amount of the operating lease at time of conversion) and the land was recorded at $ 1,167 . The land was also reclassified from finance lease right of use asset to land upon final payment being made on June 30, 2023.

INCOME TAXES The Company provides for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. FASB ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently. FASB ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the Company’s opinion, it is uncertain whether they will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded. F- 35 Due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 2017, we have calculated our federal taxes using an estimated corporate tax rate of 21 %. U.S. Tax codes and laws may be subject to further reform or adjustment which may have a material impact to the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 the Company's loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes were as follows: ($ in thousands) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Domestic $ ( 131,303 ) $ ( 40,089 ) Foreign — — Loss before income taxes $ ( 131,303 ) $ ( 40,089 ) The components of the provision for income taxes in the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows: ($ in thousands) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Current: Federal $ — $ — State — — Deferred: Federal $ 857 $ — State — — Provision for income taxes $ 857 $ — The effective income tax rate for the periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 as a percentage of pre-tax income is ( 0.65 %) and 0 %, respectively. The significant reconciling items between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate for the period ended September 30, 2023 consist of valuation allowance, adjustments to deferred taxes, state taxes and permanent items. A detailed breakout is provided below: ($ in thousands) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Tax benefit at federal statutory rate $ ( 27,574 ) $ ( 8,417 ) State taxes (net of federal benefit) 5,820 ( 303 ) Meals and entertainment 18 30 Stock based compensation 356 2,061 162(m) Excess Executive Compensation 6,823 — ISO - Disqualifying Dispositions ( 127 ) ( 58 ) Deferred only adjustment ( 13,794 ) 4,408 R&D Credits — ( 200 ) Discontinued Operations — ( 3,750 ) Other 485 ( 3 ) Change in Valuation Allowance 28,850 6,232 $ 857 $ — Deferred income taxes are the result of timing differences between GAAP accounting and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities, timing of income and expense recognition of certain items, and net operating loss carry-forwards. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in the balance sheet, net of valuation allowance. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis. In evaluating its deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. This assessment requires significant judgment. The significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows: F- 36 ($ in thousands) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Deferred Tax Assets: Right of Use - Lease Liability $ 183 $ 269 Charitable Contributions 64 7 Section 1231 Loss Carryforwards 983 1,183 Tax Credits 200 401 Stock Based Compensation 4,512 3,740 Interest Expense Carryforwards 653 194 Intangible Assets 6,999 — Net Operating Loss carryforwards 66,333 93,052 Other 2,078 — Gross Deferred Tax Assets $ 82,005 $ 98,846 Valuation Allowance ( 54,608 ) ( 28,756 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 27,397 $ 70,090 Deferred Tax Liabilities Right of Use - Lease Asset $ ( 180 ) $ ( 265 ) Prepaid Expenses ( 636 ) ( 222 ) Unrealized Gain on Derivative Asset — ( 85 ) Unrealized Gain on Equity Security — ( 63 ) Gain/Loss on Sale of Assets not on TR — ( 26 ) Other ( 898 ) — Fixed Assets & Intangible Assets ( 26,540 ) ( 69,429 ) Net Deferred Tax Liability $ ( 857 ) $ — For balance sheet presentation, the Company nets non-current deferred tax assets (net of valuation allowance) and liabilities. The following table summarizes the presentation: September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Net Non-current Deferred Tax Liabilities $ ( 857 ) $ — In accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company evaluates its deferred income taxes to determine if valuation allowances are required. Pursuant to U.S. income tax accounting standards, companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a “more-likely-than-not” standard. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities. To fully utilize the net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward, the Company will need to generate sufficient future taxable income in each respective jurisdiction. Due primarily to the Company’s history of losses, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of its deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2023 will not be realized. The Company recorded a valuation allowance to offset the DTA that is not considered realizable for the tax year ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2023 2022 Valuation Allowance $ ( 54,608 ) $ ( 28,756 ) As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately $ 270,400 of federal and $ 96,400 of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, of which federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $237 ,700 have an indefinite life. The federal net operating losses will begin to expire on September 30, 2025, while state net operating losses will begin to expire in the year ending September 30, 2036. F- 37 The Company's ability to utilize its federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credit carryforwards to reduce future taxable income and future taxes, respectively, may be subject to restrictions attributable to equity transactions that may have resulted in a change in ownership as defined by Internal Revenue Code (""IRC"") Section 382. The Company is in the process of completing a detailed study for the year ended September 30, 2023, but does not expect that the results of this study will have a material impact on its financial statements. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than a 50 % likelihood of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense, if any exist. The Company has no liability, interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2023. The Company does not anticipate the need to record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the coming year. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and state jurisdictions. The 2019-2022 tax years generally remain subject to examination by the IRS and various state taxing authorities, although the Company is not currently under examination in any jurisdiction. In August 2022, two pieces of U.S. tax legislation that have significant tax-related provisions were signed into law: (1) the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act of 2022 (the “CHIPS Act”), which creates a new advanced manufacturing investment credit under new Internal Revenue Code Section 48D, and (2) the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), which has a number of tax-related provisions, including: (a) a 15 percent book minimum tax on “adjusted financial statement income of applicable corporations,” (b) a plethora of clean energy tax incentives in the form of tax credits, and (c) a one percent excise tax on certain corporate stock buybacks. The Company will monitor additional guidance and impact that the CHIPS Act, the IRA and other potential legislation may have on its income taxes. For the period ended September 30, 2023, the Company does not believe the provisions from these legislative updates will have any material impact on the Company's income taxes. 12.

Number of Shares Weighted Average Fair Value Per Share Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding at September 30, 2021 10,995 $ 27.73 $ — Granted 7,306,250 7.18 Vested ( 1,757,938 ) 13.37 Forfeited ( 110,759 ) 15.27 Outstanding at September 30, 2022 5,448,548 $ 4.93 $ 17,326 Granted 3,880,552 3.65 Vested ( 3,813,617 ) 4.58 Cancelled ( 40,000 ) - Forfeited ( 4,048 ) 29.34 Outstanding at September 30, 2023 5,471,435 $ 4.18 $ 20,846 During the year ended September 30, 2023 , the Company granted 3,880,552 RSUs, which consisted of 360,552 time-based RSUs, 60,000 performance-based RSUs (of which 40,000 market-based awards were exchanged and reflected in the table above as cancelled). Additionally, on September 29, 2023, the Compensation Committee granted 3,460,000 market-based restricted stock units to senior leadership of the Company. The market-based awards vest 33% each tranche based upon the Company's stock price reaching 200%, 300% and 400% of the stock price on the date of grant. Each tranche will vest upon the target stock price being met for at least 10 of 20 consecutive trading days and the awards are not dependent on a defined service period. The total fair value of the award is approximately $ 13,160 and is amortized over a weighted average period of less than 1 year. During the year ended September 30, 2022 , the Company granted 7,306,250 share of restricted stock awards. Certain of the awards were issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, and comprised of 120,000 service condition based awards, 146,250 that were performance condition-based awards, and 910,000 that were market condition-based awards. The market condition based RSUs consist of 60,000 units that were perpetual in nature, and therefore, were given a derived service period of 5 years. The remaining 810,000 RSUs had a stated service period of 1 year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, on September 12, 2022, the Compensation Committee granted additional grants as follows: (1) 2,565,000 service condition based RSUs which vest over a 3-year period beginning on the grant date; (2) 2,565,000 performance based RSUs, of which, 2,381,781 vested in fiscal year 2023; and (3) 760,000 restricted stock units, which vested in March 2023 when approved by our stockholders. The Compensation Committee also modified previously issued awards from the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 as follows: (1) granted immediate vesting of the 810,000 market based awards; and (2) modified the market condition based 60,000 units that were perpetual in nature, and 10,000 unvested service condition RSUs, and were replaced with (2a) 120,000 service condition-based RSUs that vest over a 3-year period, and (2b) 120,000 performance-based RSUs, of which $ 111,429 vested in fiscal year 2023. F- 42 The fair value of the market based RSUs were determined using the Monte Carlo simulation and is in the following range: $ 11.03 - $ 17.89 per unit. The inputs of market-based RSUs for each of the fiscal years are as follows: Fair value assumptions - Market-based RSUs granted: September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 Risk free interest rate 4.59 % 0.14 % - 1.26 % Expected term (years) 10.00 1.00 - 5.00 Expected volatility 129.70 % 111.37 % - 172.18 % Cost of equity 21.55 % 20.00 % - 21.00 % As of September 30, 2023 , the Company had approximately $ 22,300 unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock unit awards that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expenses related to restricted stock units, of $ 17,720 and $ 23,661 for fiscal years ended 2023 and 2022 . 15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Zachary Bradford Chief Executive Officer, Director and Former Chief Financial Officer During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company paid Blue Chip Accounting, LLC (“Blue Chip”) $ 47 for accounting, tax, administrative services and reimbursement for office supplies. Blue Chip was 50 % beneficially owned by Mr. Bradford. None of the services were associated with work performed by Mr. Bradford. The services consisted of preparing and filing tax returns, bookkeeping, accounting and administrative support assistance. During the year ended September 30, 2022 , $ 5 was paid to Blue Chip for rent. The sublease and engagement for accounting services was terminated on December 31, 2021. F- 43 16. MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND VENDORS The Company had one mining pool operator (Foundry Digital) in fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The Company had the following significant suppliers of mining equipment, with the percentage based on purchase amounts.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Future hosting agreements On March 29, 2022, the Company entered into a hosting agreement with Lancium LLC (“Lancium”). Pursuant to the agreement, Lancium has agreed to host, power and provide maintenance and other related services to the Company's mining equipment to be placed at Lancium facilities. Further, Lancium committed to provide 200 megawatts in support of the Company's mining equipment. In addition, for a period of two and a half years following the operations commencement date, the Company will have an option to increase the power capacity supplied to the equipment up to 500 MW or 40% of the aggregate capacity of all facilities owned and operated by Lancium, whichever is lesser. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not deployed any miners pursuant to the co-location mining services at Lancium’s facility in Texas. Lancium has informed the Company that it is experiencing significant delays due to the tightening of capital in the current market climate. The Company does not have any expected timeline on the readiness of these facilities for the foreseeable future. If Lancium’s situation improves in a timeline acceptable to the Company, it would anticipate utilizing Lancium as intended but there can be no assurance that Lancium's situation or market conditions will improve. Contractual future payments The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments towards our agreements as of September 30, 2023: ($ in thousands) Fiscal Year 2024 Fiscal Year 2025 Fiscal Year 2026 Fiscal Year 2027 Fiscal Year 2028 Thereafter Total Recorded contractual obligations: Operating lease obligations $ 214 $ 201 $ 203 $ 106 $ 41 $ — $ 765 Finance lease obligations 134 9 — — — — 143 Loans 8,766 8,463 821 94 74 15 18,233 Construction in progress 33,293 — — — — — 33,293 Total $ 42,407 $ 8,673 $ 1,024 $ 200 $ 115 $ 15 $ 52,434 Contingent consideration Mawson Property Acquisition In connection with the Mawson Transaction (as discussed in Note 4), the Company and seller agreed to up to $ 2,000 of seller financing if the Company received, by April 8, 2023, written confirmation reasonably acceptable to it that it will be able to utilize at least 150 MW of additional power at the site. Such written confirmation was not F- 44 received by April 8, 2023. See Note 4 for additional description of the resolution of this contingency. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has $ 0 recorded as contingent liability associated with the Mawson Transaction. Legal contingencies Bishins v. CleanSpark, Inc. et al. On January 20, 2021, Scott Bishins (“Bishins”), individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (together, the “Class”), filed a class action complaint (the “Class Complaint”) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, Zachary Bradford (“Bradford”), and its Chief Financial Officer at the time, Lori Love (“Love”) (such action, the “Class Action”). On December 2, 2021, the Court appointed Darshan Hasthantra as lead Plaintiff (together, with Bishins, the “Plaintiffs”), and Glancy, Prongay and Murray LLP as class counsel. Hasthantra filed an Amended Complaint on February 28, 2022 (the “Amended Class Complaint”). In the Amended Class Complaint, Love is no longer a defendant and S. Matthew Schultz (“Schultz”) has been added as a defendant (the Company, Bradford and Schultz, collectively, the “Defendants”). The Amended Class Complaint alleges that, between December 10, 2020 and August 16, 2021 (the “Class Period”), Defendants made material misstatements and omissions regarding the Company’s acquisition of ATL and its anticipated expansion of bitcoin mining operations. In particular, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants: (1) were misleading in their various public announcements related to the timeline for expanding ATL’s mining capacity; and (2) failed to disclose other material conditions purportedly related to the Company’s acquisition of ATL, including that an ATL predecessor had filed for bankruptcy about six months prior to the acquisition, that another bitcoin miner had declined to acquire ATL, and that a related party had performed an audit of ATL for the Company. The Amended Class Complaint seeks: (a) certification of the Class, (b) an award of compensatory damages to the Class, and (c) an award of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Class in the litigation. To date, no class has been certified in the Class Action. The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss in April 2022 which, after briefing, was denied in January 2023. On February 15, 2023, the Company filed its answer responding to Plaintiffs’ claims and asserting affirmative defenses. The case is moving forward in discovery. The Company believes that the claims raised in the Amended Class Complaint are without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims. The Class Action may distract the Company and cost the Company’s management time, effort and expense to defend against the claims made in the Amended Class Complaint. Notwithstanding the Company’s belief that the claims are without merit, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the Class Action, and in the event the Company does not prevail in such action, the Company, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Shareholder Derivative Actions Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Actions On May 26, 2021, Andrea Ciceri (“Ciceri”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “Ciceri Derivative Action”) in the United States District Court in the District of Nevada against certain of the Company’s officers and directors (collectively referred to as “Ciceri Derivative Defendants”) ( Ciceri v. Bradford, Schultz, Love, Beynon, McNeill and Wood ). On June 22, 2021, Mark Perna (“Perna”) (Ciceri, Perna, and Ciceri Derivative Defendants collectively referred to as the “Parties”) filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “Perna Derivative Action”) in the same Court against the same Ciceri Derivative Defendants, making substantially similar allegations. On June 29, 2021, the Court consolidated the Ciceri Derivative Action with the Perna Derivative Action in accordance with a stipulation among the parties (the consolidated case referred to as the “Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action”). The Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action alleges that Ciceri Derivative Defendants: (1) made materially false and misleading public statements about the Company’s business and prospects; (2) did not maintain adequate internal controls; and (3) did not disclose several related party transactions benefitting insiders, questionable uses of corporate assets, and excessive compensation. The claims asserted against all Ciceri Derivative F- 45 Defendants include breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. On or about November 2, 2021, plaintiffs in the Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action withdrew their claim for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities and Exchange Act, which had been asserted against only Bradford and Love. The Consolidated Derivative Action seeks declaratory relief, monetary damages, and imposition of adequate corporate governance and internal controls. Plaintiffs were given the opportunity to submit an Amended Complaint by November 25, 2021, but elected not to. In January 2022, the Parties agreed to stay the entirety of the case pending the outcome of the Motion to Dismiss in the Class Action. On January 5, 2023, the Class Action Motion to Dismiss was denied, thereby terminating the stay in this matter. On April 20, 2023, the Ciceri Derivative Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Consolidated Derivative Action. Plaintiffs’ filed their opposition on June 12, 2023 and Defendants’ filed their reply in further support of their Motion to Dismiss on July 13, 2023. In June 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors appointed a special litigation committee (the “SLC”), comprised of independent Directors and represented by independent counsel. The SLC was established to investigate, evaluate and prosecute as appropriate any and all claims asserted in the Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action as well as the Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions (defined below). In October 2023, the SLC moved to intervene and stay the Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action. The Ciceri Plaintiffs did not oppose that motion and, accordingly, on October 23, 2023, the Court granted it, staying the case until July 23, 2024, pending the completion of the SLC’s investigation. The Ciceri Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss was denied as moot, but may be re-filed if and when the stay is lifted. The Company believes that the claims raised in that case are without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims. The Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action may distract the Company and cost the Company’s management time, effort and expense to defend against the claims. Notwithstanding the Company’s belief that the claims are without merit, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the Consolidated Derivative Action, and in the event the Company does not prevail in such action, the Company, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions On February 21, 2023, Brandon Smith (“Smith”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County against certain of the Company’s officers and directors ( Smith v. Bradford, Love, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill and Wood). On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff Nicholas Iraci (“Iraci”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “Iraci Derivative Action”) in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County against certain of the Company’s officers and directors ( Iraci v. Bradford, Love, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill and Wood) . On March 1, 2023, Plaintiff Eric Atanasoff (“Atanasoff”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “Atanasoff Derivative Action”) in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County against certain of the Company’s Officers and Directors ( Atanasoff v. Bradford, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill, and Wood ). On March 8, 2023, Plaintiff Travis France (“France”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “France Derivative Action”) in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County against certain of the Company’s officers and directors ( France v. Bradford, Love, Tadayon, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill and Wood ). The Smith Derivative Action, Iraci Derivative Action, Atanasoff Derivative Action and France Derivative Action each contain substantially similar allegations, namely that the defendants: (1) made materially false and misleading public statements about the Company’s business and prospects; (2) were misleading in their various public announcements related to the timeline for expanding ATL’s mining capacity; (3) failed to disclose other material conditions purportedly related to the Company’s acquisition of ATL, including that an ATL predecessor had filed for bankruptcy about six months prior to the acquisition, that another bitcoin miner had declined to acquire ATL, and that a related party had performed an audit of ATL for the Company; (4) did not maintain adequate internal controls; and (5) did not disclose several related party transactions benefitting insiders and excessive compensation. Between February and June 2023, the respective parties to the Smith Derivative Action, Iraci Derivative Action, Atanasoff Derivative Action and France Derivative Action litigated federal court versus state court jurisdictional F- 46 issues and, ultimately, each of the aforementioned derivative actions were consolidated into the Smith Derivative Action in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada (the “Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions”). The claims asserted in the operative Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions include breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment and corporate waste. The damages sought include monetary damages, restitution, declaratory relief, litigation costs, and imposition of adequate corporate governance and internal controls. In September 2023, the Consolidated Smith Derivative Action filed a Motion to Dismiss the case based on the fact that the Plaintiffs lack standing, do not successfully rebut the business judgment rule, and fail to allege certain elements of the claims they assert. In June 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors appointed the SLC, comprised of independent Directors and represented by independent counsel. The SLC was established to investigate, evaluate and prosecute as appropriate any and all claims asserted in the Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action (defined above) as well as the Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions. In October 2023, the SLC moved to intervene and stay the Consolidated Smith Derivative Action, which the Plaintiffs opposed. On November 6, 2023, the Court held a hearing on the SLC’s motion during which it granted the SLC’s motion to intervene and stayed the Consolidated Smith Derivative Action for five months. The Court has not yet entered an order memorializing its decision. The Company believes that the claims raised in Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions are without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims. The Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions may distract the Company and cost the Company’s management time, effort and expense to defend against the claims. Notwithstanding the Company’s belief that the claims are without merit, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions, and in the event the Company does not prevail in such action, the Company, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Solar Watt Solutions, Inc., v. Pathion, Inc. On January 6, 2022 , Solar Watt Solutions, Inc., (“SWS”) filed suit in the Superior Court of the State of California in the County of Santa Clara against Pathion, Inc. (“Pathion”) for breach of contract, conversion, unjust enrichment and negligent misrepresentation. Prior to its acquisition by the Company, SWS paid Pathion $ 419 for solar batteries and related equipment for delivery in August 2019, later amended to November 2019. Pathion never delivered any of the items purchased by SWS. Pathion’s breach resulted in SWS being unable to complete a separate contract and cost the end-user client over $ 15 per month in electricity costs. SWS is seeking an award of compensatory damages totaling over $ 500 . Pathion filed an answer on or around February 16, 2022, generally denying the claims asserted by SWS. SWS served discovery on Pathion in May 2022; Pathion did not serve responses. Accordingly, SWS filed a Motion for Order Establishing Admissions and for Sanctions on July 25, 2022 and was awarded $ 2 in sanctions. The parties are currently engaged in the discovery process and a trial date is scheduled for March 2024. Darfon America Corp. vs. CleanSpark, Inc. On August 18, 2022, Darfon America Corp. (""Darfon"") filed a breach of contract suit in connection with a purchase contract for batteries. Plaintiff contends that the Company ordered batteries and did not pay for them. Plaintiff was seeking $ 5,400 in damages and additional costs and fees. The Company contends, among other things, that the batteries did not meet the necessary specifications. On January 27, 2023, the Superior Court of the State of California in the County of San Diego orally granted Plaintiff’s Motion for a pre-judgment Writ of Attachment. While no written order has been received as of the date of this filing, this Writ of Attachment will likely provide Plaintiff with right to seek a lien on any Company assets located in California. The Company had recorded a legal reserve of $ 1,100 in December 2022 in connection with this matter, which had represented the Plaintiff’s unmitigated damages less what the Company has already paid. In April 2023, the Company settled the suit with Darfon for a total amount of $ 3,800 . The Company recorded the additional settlement expense of $ 2,700 in March 2023, which is included in professional fees on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The case was dismissed with prejudice effective July 27, 2023. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, F- 47 there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. F- 48 18. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS We have evaluated events occurring between the end of the most recent fiscal year and the date the financial statements were issued through December 1, 2023. There were no material subsequent events except as disclosed below: At-the-Market Equity Issuances From October 1, 2023 through December 1, 2023, the Company issued 24,475,832 shares under its ATM offering facility resulting in net proceeds of $ 99,336 . Issuance of Shares under Restricted Stock Grants In October 2023, the Company settled and issued 88,888 shares to members of its Board of Directors in connection with time-based RSUs that vested on September 30, 2023. Purchase Agreement On October 6, 2023, the Company executed an agreement to purchase 4.4 exahashes per second (EH/s) of the recently announced Antminer S21 bitcoin mining machines, which have an efficiency rating of 17.5 joules per terahash (J/TH). The delivery of the mining machines are set to begin in January 2024. The agreement allows for 20% of the purchase price to be paid to the seller 365 days after the date that machines are ready-to-ship. The purchase was made pursuant to the terms of a Future Sales and Purchase Agreement entered into by and between the Company and BITMAIN TECHNOLOGIES DELAWARE LIMITED on October 6, 2023. The Company plans to use the mining machines to expand its digital currency mining activities through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. F- 49 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report (under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”)). Based on that assessment, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, as described below. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures is expressed at a level of reasonable assurance because management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO and effected by our Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our Board and management; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Under the supervision and participation of our management, including our CEO, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As part of our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, management identified the following material weakness: the Company did not adequately design and maintain effective general information technology controls over third-party information systems and applications that are relevant to the preparation of the Company’s financial statements: A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This material weakness did not result in any identified material misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Based on this material weakness, management concluded that at September 30, 2023, internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Our independent registered public accounting firm, MaloneBailey, LLP, has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, which appears on page F-2. 44 Following identification of the material weakness and prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed substantive procedures for the year ended September 30, 2023. Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our CEO and CFO has certified that, based on their knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of CleanSpark as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-K. MaloneBailey, LLP has issued an unqualified opinion on our financial statements, which appears on page F-1. REMEDIATION Management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include the following: We believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness, once management has performed its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting including the remedial measures described above. The weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be fully completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2024. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Except for the material weakness identified during the quarter, as of September 30, 2023, and except for the remedial measures described above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Item 9B. Other Information None of the Company’s directors or officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023.

Business As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” “CleanSpark, Inc.” and “CleanSpark” mean CleanSpark, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. Overview CleanSpark, Inc. is a leading bitcoin mining company incorporated in Nevada, whose common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company, through itself and its wholly owned subsidiaries, has operated in the bitcoin mining sector since December 2020. The only cryptocurrency we mine is bitcoin. From March 2014 to June 30, 2022, we provided advanced energy technology solutions to commercial and residential customers to solve modern energy challenges in the alternative energy sector. As of June 30, 2022, we deemed our energy operations to be discontinued operations due to our strategic decision to strictly focus on its bitcoin mining operations and divest of our energy assets. We are currently working on developing a long-term sustainability and clean energy plan with respect to our bitcoin mining operations. We are using clean and renewable energy resources that we currently have reasonable access to in our bitcoin mining locations in order to further support our sustainability efforts. Lines of Business Bitcoin Mining Through CleanSpark, Inc and our wholly owned subsidiaries ATL Data Centers LLC (“ATL”), CleanBlok, Inc. (“CleanBlok”), CleanSpark DW, LLC, and CleanSpark GLP, LLC, we mine bitcoin. We entered the bitcoin mining industry through our acquisition of ATL in December 2020, acquired a second data center in August 2021, a third data center and mining equipment in August 2022, a fourth data center and mining equipment in October 2022, and have had a co-location agreement with New York-based Coinmint in place since July 2021. Bitcoin mining has now become our principal revenue generating business activity. We currently intend to continue to acquire additional facilities, equipment and infrastructure capacity to continue to expand our bitcoin mining operations. In August 2022, we completed the acquisition of certain real property located in Wilkes County, Georgia, and approximately 3,400 S19 and S19j Pro series bitcoin miners capable of providing computing power of approximately 341,000 terahash per second. The property acquired provided us with a turn-key data center campus capable of supporting approximately 1 exahash per second of computing power, upon closing of the acquisition. We expect to expand the campus to support approximately 2.6 exahash per second of computing power (collectively, the “WAHA and SPRE Assets”). In October 2022, we acquired the lease for 16.35 acres of real property located in Sandersville, Washington County, Georgia, all personal property situated on such property, and 6,349 application specific integrated circuit miners (“ASICs”) capable of providing computing power of approximately 530,000 terahash per second from subsidiaries of Mawson Infrastructure Group, Inc. The property acquired provided the Company with a turn-key data center campus capable of supporting approximately 2.4 exahash per second of computing power, upon closing of the acquisition. The company expects to expand the campus to support approximately 7.0 exahash per second of computing power (collectively, the “Mawson Assets”). Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the goal of serving as a digital means of exchanging and storing value. Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that depends upon a consensus-based network and a public ledger called a “blockchain”, which contains a record of every bitcoin transaction ever processed. The bitcoin network is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network, powered by users participating in the consensus protocol, with no central authority or middlemen, that has wide network participation. The authenticity of each bitcoin transaction is protected through digital signatures that correspond with addresses of users that send and receive bitcoin. Users have full control over remitting bitcoin from their own sending addresses. All transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are transparent, allowing those running the appropriate software to confirm the validity of each transaction. To be recorded on the blockchain, each bitcoin transaction is validated through a proof-of-work consensus method, which entails solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and post them on the blockchain. This process is called 5 mining. Miners are rewarded with bitcoins, both in the form of newly-created bitcoins and fees in bitcoin, for successfully solving the mathematical problems and providing computing power to the network. Factors such as access to computer processing capacity, interconnectivity, electricity cost, environmental factors (such as cooling capacity) and location play important roles in mining. As of the date of this filing, our operating mining units are currently capable of producing over 5.75 exahash per second (“EH/s”) of computing power. In bitcoin mining, “hashrate” is a measure of the computing and processing power and speed by which a mining computer mines and processes transactions on the bitcoin network. We are actively expanding our bitcoin mining business and as of the date of this filing reached 5.75 EH/s in computing power, which exceeded our target guidance as set in August, 2022 of reaching 5.0 EH/s in computing power by December 31, 2022. We expect to continue increasing our computing power through 2023 and beyond as we expand our infrastructure at our owned sites in the State of Georgia, seek strategic acquisition targets, and through strategic co-location agreements. A company’s computing power measured in Hashrate is generally considered to be one of the most important metrics for evaluating bitcoin mining companies. We obtain bitcoin as a result of our mining operations, and we sell bitcoin from time to time, to support our operations and strategic growth. We do not currently plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin (other than as necessary to convert our bitcoin to U.S. dollars) or to engage in hedging activities related to our holding of bitcoin; however, our decisions to hold or sell bitcoin at any given time may be impacted by the bitcoin market, which has been historically characterized by significant volatility. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell bitcoin that we hold, or the number of bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell bitcoins are currently determined by management by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries CSRE Properties, LLC, CSRE Property Management Company LLC, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, CSRE Properties Washington, LLC and CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC we maintain real property holdings. Markets, Geography and Major Customers Bitcoin is a global store and exchange of value used by people across the world as an asset and to conduct daily transactions. Mining bitcoin supports the global bitcoin blockchain and the millions of people that depend on it for economic security and other benefits. Strictly speaking, there is no customer market for mining bitcoin but we consider our mining pool operators as customers because they compensate us for providing processing power to the mining pool (see Item 1A. Risk Factors- “Our reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may adversely affect an investment in us . ”). We own and operate our own facilities and do not lease mining space to other mining companies or private individuals that mine. Our wholly-owned mining operations are located in the State of Georgia in the United States. We also have a relationship with a facility located in New York State that hosts a portion of our miners. Working Capital Items The bitcoin mining industry is highly competitive and dependent on specialized mining machines that have few manufacturers. Machine purchases require large down payments and miner deliveries often arrive many months after initial orders are placed. However, over the last 12 months, we have seen a significant improvement in the availability and pricing for bitcoin mining machines. The current market conditions have provided opportunities to purchase both new and used machines on the spot-market from other miners or retail-dealers of machines for better financial terms and delivery terms, but there can be no guarantee that such opportunities will continue on a long-term basis. Currently, we are purchasing more mining machines through re-sellers than direct through manufacturers. Whether re-sellers or manufacturers have better purchase and delivery terms or more/superior inventory available is likely to change from time to time. At the time we acquired ATL in December 2020, we had approximately 3,471 bitcoin mining units with application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”) in operation, which produced approximately 190 petahash/s. Since acquiring ATL, we have expanded its operations and purchased additional ASICs. As of September 30, 2022, we had over 42,000 ASICs in daily operation, which are producing approximately 4.1 EH/s (approximately 58,500 producing 5.75 EH/s as of the date of this filing ) 6 In addition to the 58,500 ASICs in operation as of the date of this filing, the Company has received and is in the process of installing approximately 1,000 additional miners, and expect to receive an additional 6,400 miners in the coming weeks, which have been fully pre-paid. The Company expects to enter into additional agreements to purchase more miners and infrastructure in the coming year. The majority of miners we operate and expect to operate once received are the latest generation of miners manufactured by Bitmain, including the S19, S19-Pro, S19j-Pro and S19 XP. Distribution, Marketing and Strategic Relationships We have developed strategic relationships with well-established companies in key areas including traditional and renewable energy, infrastructure, construction, and bitcoin mining equipment procurement. In addition to operating our own mining facilities, we may engage with third-parties to host and operate mining equipment on behalf of the Company. Coinmint On July 8, 2021, CleanBlok entered into a services agreement with Coinmint, LLC (“Coinmint”). Pursuant to the agreement, Coinmint has agreed to house and power certain of our cryptocurrency mining equipment in its facilities, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to mine bitcoin on our behalf. All bitcoin mining services performed by Coinmint are conducted using mining equipment owned by the Company. As of the date of this filing, we have deployed approximately 16,400 total miners pursuant to the co-location mining services agreement at Coinmint’s facility in New York. Pursuant to the agreement, as consideration for the services, we pay Coinmint certain services fees, which are based on the operating costs incurred by Coinmint in performing the services, and a variable fee calculated based on the profitability of the bitcoin mined during the relevant payment period, subject to uptime performance commitments. The agreement had an initial term of one year, after which it renews automatically for three-month periods until terminated in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Lancium On March 29, 2022, the Company entered into a hosting agreement with Lancium LLC (“Lancium”). Pursuant to the agreement, Lancium has agreed to host, power and provide maintenance and other related services to our mining equipment to be placed at Lancium facilities. Further, Lancium committed to provide 200 megawatts in support of our mining equipment. In addition, for a period of two and a half years following the operations commencement date, we will have an option to increase the power capacity supplied to the equipment up to 500 MW or 40% of the aggregate capacity of all facilities owned and operated by Lancium, whichever is lesser. As of the date of this filing, we have not deployed any miners pursuant to the co-location mining services at Lancium’s facility in Texas. Lancium has informed us that they are experiencing significant delays due to the tightening of capital in the current market climate. We now expect the readiness of these facilities to be late calendar 2023, and based on market conditions, perhaps even later. If Lancium’s situation improves in a timeline acceptable to us, we anticipate utilizing Lancium as intended but there can be no assurance that their situation or market conditions will improve. As of the date of this filing, we have paid no consideration or deposits to Lancium and, accordingly, there is no direct financial risk with respect to the delays Lancium is currently experiencing. To the extent services are provided in the future, the Company has agreed to compensate Lancium based on a power and hosting fee based on kilowatt hours consumed by the Company’s equipment, subject to service level adjustments and credits, if any. The agreement has an initial term of five years from the operations commencement date (unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the Agreement), after which it will renew automatically for two-year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least ninety days prior to the expiration of the term or renewal term, as applicable. Materials and Suppliers We engage in high efficiency bitcoin mining by using ASICs. These specialized computers, often called mining rigs, have few manufacturers. A majority of the machines we purchased this year were manufactured by Bitmain, MicroBT 7 or Canaan, the top three preeminent manufacturers of bitcoin mining rigs. All three companies are headquartered in China and manufacture throughout Asia. In addition to ASICS, mining equipment includes networking equipment, power cords, racking, other specialized storage, transformers, and energy equipment. We rely on utility providers for our power needs. These utilities buy into local energy mixes to source power. We make every effort to establish our facilities in locations serviced by utilities that generate a substantial portion of their energy from clean and renewable sources. We supplement a portion of the energy mix provided by our utility providers with the purchase of renewable energy credits because the precise ratio of renewable energy in local energy mixes is not within our control. We have significant exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices through our power providers. We actively manage these risks through activities such as deployment of advanced software solutions to increase unit efficiency and energy curtailment when appropriate. These energy market prices are also significantly impacted by ongoing inflation and the war in Ukraine. Historically, our methodology and operations have been efficient and resilient enough to withstand these market pressures and global events, but there can be no certainty that we will not be negatively affected in the future. We believe that there is significant risk that energy prices will continue to be elevated in 2023. Historically, we have been able to manage our supply chains effectively, but global supply chains continue to be constrained, and from time-to-time experience substantial increases in shipping costs and logistical delays as we make efforts to ensure timely delivery of equipment. There can be no certainty that we will not be affected in the future, and we believe that there is a significant risk that equipment supply chains will continue to be affected in 2023. While some macro-economic indicators available as of the date of this filing suggest that inflation may be slowing, inflationary pressures impact virtually all aspects of our materials and suppliers, including power prices, and are likely to impact our fiscal year 2023. Environmental Issues No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from the Company’s direct operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. Starting in the fourth calendar quarter of 2021, we began to voluntarily purchase renewable energy credits to offset a significant portion of our energy usage that is derived from non-renewable sources. The Company has also engaged market professionals to enhance and build a comprehensive environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) strategy. There are increasing concerns over the large energy usage of bitcoin mining and its effects on the environment. Many media reports focus exclusively on the energy requirements of bitcoin mining and cite it as an environmental concern. However, we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets that we serve, nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Competition Bitcoin mining is a global activity. During fiscal year 2021, a majority of bitcoin mining occurred in China. After China banned bitcoin mining in May 2021, the center of mining moved to North America. Although bitcoin mining by its nature is not a directly competitive business, all miners compete for bitcoin rewards; based on this, we define competitors as other bitcoin miners. Our competitors include large, publicly-listed mining companies, large private mining companies, and, in some cases, independent, individual miners who pool resources. We believe our principal competitive advantages include our energy background, a combination of owned, operated, and co-located miners and facilities, our strategic use of the bitcoin we mine to fund operations growth, and our commitment to sustainable business practices, including sourcing renewable energy. Within North America, our major competitors include: 8 In addition to the foregoing, we compete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on mining activities at scale. We face significant competition in certain operational aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, obtaining low cost electricity, obtaining clean energy sources, obtaining access to energy sites with reliable sources of power, and evaluating new technology developments in the industry. Intellectual Property We do not currently own any patents in connection with our existing and planned bitcoin mining related operations. We do rely, and expect to continue relying, upon trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Government Regulation Bitcoin Mining Cryptocurrency mining is largely an unregulated activity at both the state and federal level. We anticipate that cryptocurrency mining will be a focus for increased regulation in the near- and long-term, and we cannot predict how future regulations may affect our business or operations. State regulation of cryptocurrency mining is important with respect to where we conduct our mining operations. The majority of our mining facilities are located in Georgia, which is one of the most favorable regulatory environments for cryptocurrency miners. However, we also have co-location operations in New York, which has generally been more aggressive in its regulation of cryptocurrency. Current New York regulation, including a recent moratorium on certain bitcoin mining operations that run on carbon-based power sources signed into law on November 22, 2022, in our view, do not impact our decision to operate our miners at the Coinmint facility in New York in the foreseeable future; however, if the regulatory landscape changes, we would have to evaluate whether to relocate our hosted miners to one of our facilities in Georgia or to other facilities outside of New York State, which could be costly and we would not be able to operate the miners while they are being relocated. Further, in March 2022, the United States announced plans to establish a unified federal regulatory regime for cryptocurrency, and a group of United States Senators sent a letter to the United States Treasury Department asking Treasury Secretary Yellen to investigate Treasury’s ability to monitor and restrict the use of cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions imposed by the United States. We are unable to predict the impact that any new regulations may have on our business at the time of filing this Annual Report. We continue to monitor and proactively engage in dialogue on legislative matters related to our industry. In August 2021, the chair of the SEC stated that he believed investors using digital asset trading platforms are not adequately protected, and that activities on the platforms can implicate the securities laws, commodities laws and banking laws, raising a number of issues related to protecting investors and consumers, guarding against illicit activity, and ensuring financial stability. The chair expressed a need for the SEC to have additional authorities to prevent transactions, products, and platforms from “falling between regulatory cracks,” as well as for more resources to protect investors in “this growing and volatile sector.” The chair called for federal legislation centering on digital asset trading, lending, and decentralized finance platforms, seeking “additional plenary authority” to write rules for digital asset trading and lending. In addition, it is possible the failure of FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”) in November 2022 and the resulting market turmoil could lead to increased SEC, CFTC, or criminal investigations, enforcement, and/or other regulatory activity. While these statements are focused on digital asset exchanges (not bitcoin miners), the failure of large exchanges may impact the adoption and value of bitcoin. Additionally, because we store and sell our bitcoin on exchanges, we may also be potentially impacted by exchange failures in that respect. For those reasons, we carefully vet our custodians 9 for adequate compliance with U.S. laws as well as liquidity, using the information available to us, but we cannot be certain that we will be able to avoid the negative effects of a large exchange failure. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, such as further regulation by the SEC, CFTC, and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” beginning on page 11 of this Annual Report. Cybersecurity Our share of bitcoins mined from our pools are initially received by us in wallets we control, which are maintained by Coinbase Inc., a U.S. based digital assets exchange. We currently sell the majority of the bitcoin we mine and utilize hot wallets to hold this bitcoin immediately prior to selling for working capital purposes. We hold any remainder of our bitcoin in cold storage. Bitcoins we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access. Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure bitcoins, such as by attacking the bitcoin network source code, exchange miners, third-party platforms (including Coinbase), cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of substantial holdings of bitcoin, and as we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats. We have established a Cybersecurity Committee, with the purpose of meeting at least semi-annually and providing recommendations to Executive Management with respect to our information technology use and protection, including but not limited to data governance, privacy, compliance and cybersecurity. To our knowledge there has been no security breach or incident, unauthorized access or disclosure, or other compromise of or relating to the Company or its subsidiaries hard wallets, cold wallets, information technology and computer systems, networks, hardware, software, data and databases, equipment or technology. We have not been notified of, and has no knowledge of any event or condition that could result in, any security breach or incident, unauthorized access or disclosure or other compromise to their IT Systems and Data, and we have implemented appropriate controls, policies, procedures, and technological safeguards to maintain and protect the integrity, continuous operation, redundancy and security of our IT Systems and Data reasonably consistent with industry standards and practices, or as required by applicable regulatory standards. We are presently in material compliance with all applicable laws or statutes and all judgments, orders, rules and regulations of any court or arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority, internal policies and contractual obligations relating to the privacy and security of IT Systems and Data and to the protection of such IT Systems and Data from unauthorized use, access, misappropriation or modification. Human Capital Resources; Employees; Personnel We believe that our future success depends, in no small part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. As of December 1, 2022, we had 130 staff members, 121 of which were full time and all located in the United States. We believe that we have adequate personnel and resources with the specialized skills required to carry out our operations successfully. Employees participate in equity incentive plans and receive generous compensation in the form of salary and benefits. We continually seek to hire and retain talented professionals, although the competition for such personnel in our segments is significant. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have a strong and engaging relationship with our employees. We cultivate trust and transparency among our employees, the communities we operate in, and the people around the world who depend on Bitcoin as we jointly strive to leave the world better than we found it, build the infrastructure of the future, and value growth for the greater good. Discontinued Operations As of June 30, 2022, we deemed our energy operations to be discontinued operations due to our strategic decision to strictly focus on bitcoin mining operations and divest of the majority of our energy assets. 10 Through our discontinued operations segment, we previously provided energy solutions through our wholly-owned subsidiaries CleanSpark, LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc., GridFabric, LLC, and through ATL Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. These solutions consisted of engineering, design and software solutions, custom hardware solutions, Open Automated Demand response (“OpenADR”), solar, energy storage for microgrid and distributed energy systems. We have since sold the majority of oursoftware and intellectual property assets related to the Energy Segment (including mPulse, mVoult and GridFabric LLC), and we are in the process of selling additional inventory and other assets. We still own patented gasification energy technologies and are not currently planning to sell or market these technologies. Our technology converts organic material into synthesis gas, which can be used as fuel for a variety of applications and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether). Other business activities Through ATL, we also provide traditional data center services to a small number of remaining clients, such as providing customers with rack space, power and equipment, and offer several cloud services including virtual services, virtual storage, and data backup services. ATL is in the process of offloading these customers. Company Websites We maintain a corporate website at: www.cleanspark.com. The contents of these websites are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report. We file reports with the SEC, which are available on our website free of charge. These reports include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Section 16 filings on Form 3, Form 4, and Form 5, and other related filings and exhibits, each of which is provided on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file such materials with or furnish them to the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, including the Company. Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize, that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Risk Factors Summary Below is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below and should be carefully considered, together with other information included in this Annual Report. Risks Related to Our Business 11 12 Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Enforcement Operations Risks Related to Our Securities Risks Related to Our Business Our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on the price of bitcoin, which has historically been volatile. Our primary focus on our bitcoin mining operations and our associated expansion efforts is largely based on our assumptions regarding the future value of bitcoin, which has been subject to significant historical volatility and may 13 be subject to influence from malicious actors, real or perceived scarcity, political, economic, and regulatory conditions, and speculation making its price more volatile. It is difficult to accurately predict the future market price of bitcoin and may also inhibit consumer trust in and market acceptance of bitcoin as a means of exchange, which could limit the future adoption of bitcoin and, as a result, our assumptions could prove incorrect. If our assumptions prove incorrect and the future price of bitcoin is not sufficiently high, our income from our bitcoin mining operations may not exceed our costs, and our operations may never achieve profitability. We have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses and negative cash flow, and we may never achieve consistent profitability. Our limited operating history, in particular our recent entry into the bitcoin mining business, makes it difficult to evaluate our business and predict our future results of operations. Although we have achieved profitable quarters in the past, to date, we have not maintained consistent profitability from period to period, and no assurances can be made that we will achieve consistent profitability in the near future, if ever. From the Company’s inception through September 30, 2022, we sustained $196,053,911 in cumulative net losses, and we had a net loss from our continuing operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 of $40,089,393. We have generated these losses as we execute our business plan and expand on our bitcoin mining activities as bitcoin prices are in a bear market. We will continue to recognize losses in our continuing operations unless and until bitcoin prices recover. Supply chain and shipping disruptions have resulted in shipping delays, a significant increase in lead times and shipping costs, and could increase expansion costs and result in lower or delayed bitcoin production. Supply chain disruptions, resulting from factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, labor supply and shipping container shortages, have impacted, and may continue to impact, us and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers. These disruptions have resulted in longer lead times and increased product costs and shipping expenses, including with respect to the delivery of miners that we have purchased. While we have taken steps to minimize the impact of these increased costs by working closely with our suppliers and customers, there can be no assurances that unforeseen events impacting the supply chain will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. Additionally, the impacts supply chain disruptions have on our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are not within our control. Although we have seen improvements in the last 12 months, it is not currently possible to predict how long it will take for these supply chain disruptions to return to pre-pandemic levels, if at all. Prolonged supply chain disruptions impacting us and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers could increase lead times, delay expansion efforts, increase product costs , result in reduced bitcoin production, result in a delay in the delivery of miners that we have purchased, and continue to increase shipping costs associated with the delivery of our purchased miners, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our future success is difficult to predict because we operate in emerging and evolving industries that are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles. The bitcoin mining and related industries are emerging and evolving, which may lead to period-to-period variability in our operating results and may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned within a business cycle, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may be unable to successfully compete. We compete in the highly competitive market for certain operational aspects of our bitcoin mining business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, obtaining the lowest cost of electricity, obtaining clean energy sources, obtaining access to energy sites with reliable sources of power, and evaluating new technology developments in the industry. Evolving industry standards, rapid price changes and product obsolescence impact the market and its various participants, including us. Our competitors include many domestic and foreign companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage. The success of our bitcoin mining business will be dependent upon our ability to 14 purchase additional miners, adapt to changes in technology in the industry, and to obtain sufficient energy at reasonable prices, amongst other things. A significant part of our success will depend on our reliance on and ability to manage our construction contractors and suppliers, including mining equipment suppliers, in order to meet our expansion efforts in keeping with planned timelines and cost estimates, and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for the purchase and delivery of our miners to support our bitcoin mining operations. There can be no assurance that such key suppliers and manufacturers will provide components, products or miners in a timely and cost-efficient manner or otherwise meet our needs and expectations. Any disruption in such key suppliers’ or manufacturers could delay our ability to expand our bitcoin mining operations. Our ability to manage such relationships and timely replace suppliers and manufacturers, if necessary, is critical to our success. Our failure to timely replace our manufacturers and suppliers, should that become necessary, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. For example, we depend on Bitmain, MicroBT and Canaan for our mining rigs and any change in their ability to manufacture and deliver these products could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Additionally, we are reliant on third parties for our expansion efforts, including construction contractors and suppliers of infrastructure, to provide accurate estimates and timelines. If those parties experience delays, cannot access adequate capital, are exposed to inflation pressures or supply chain disruptions, our expansion efforts will be similarly impacted. We rely heavily on our management team, whose continued service and performance is critical to our future success. Any failure by management to properly manage growth, including hiring and retaining competent and skilled management and other personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We currently have four executive officers — our Chief Executive Officer and President, Zachary Bradford, our Chief Financial Officer, Gary Vecchiarelli, our Chief Communications Officer, Isaac Holyoak, and S. Matthew Schulz, our Executive Chairman — who are responsible for our management functions and are responsible for strategic development, financing and other critical functions. Some of the members of our management team and our Board of Directors do not have prior experience in the bitcoin mining industry. This lack of experience may impair our management teams’ and directors’ ability to evaluate and make well-informed decisions involving our current operations and any future projects we may undertake in the industries in which we operate. Such impairment and lack of experience could adversely affect our business, financial condition and future operations. Our future success depends significantly on the continued service and performance of our existing management team. The departure, death, disability or other extended loss of services of any member of our management team, particularly with little or no notice, could cause delays on projects, frustrate our growth prospects and could have an adverse impact on our industry relationships, our project exploration and development programs, other aspects of our business and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects. Our success, growth prospects, and ability to capitalize on market opportunities also depend to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire, motivate and retain qualified managerial personnel, including additional senior members of management. Our growth may be constrained by resource limitations as competitors and customers compete for increasingly scarce human capital resources. The demand for professionals familiar with bitcoin mining and other skilled workers is currently high. Our competitors may be able to offer a work environment with higher compensation or more opportunities than we can. Any new personnel we hire may not be or become as productive as we expect, as we may face challenges in adequately or appropriately integrating them into our workforce and culture. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, our ability to successfully implement our business plan, grow our company and maintain or expand our mining operations may be adversely affected, and the costs of doing so may increase, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our expansion could also place significant demands on our management, operations, systems, accounting, internal controls and financial resources. If we experience difficulties in any of these areas, we may not be able to expand our business successfully or effectively manage our growth. Any failure by management to manage growth and to respond 15 to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have engaged in, and in the future may engage in, strategic acquisitions and other arrangements that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders, reduce our financial resources and harm our operating results. We have previously engaged in strategic transactions, including acquisitions of companies, technologies and personnel, such as our recent acquisitions of the Mawson Assets in October 2022, WAHA and SPRE Assets in August 2022, ATL in December 2020, and, as part of our growth strategy, in the future, we may seek additional opportunities to grow our mining operations, including through purchases of miners and facilities from other operating companies, including companies in financial distress. Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend on the availability of, and our ability to identify, suitable acquisition and investment opportunities at an acceptable cost, our ability to compete effectively to attract those opportunities and the availability of financing to complete acquisitions. Future acquisitions may require us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership, assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company, record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses, and become subject to litigation. The benefits of an acquisition may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition will produce the intended benefits in a timely manner or to the extent anticipated or at all. We may experience difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, and personnel of an acquired company or be subjected to liability for the target’s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest. Such integration may divert management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business. Future acquisitions may also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions, the possibility of insufficient revenues to offset the expenses we incur in connection with an acquisition and potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees and suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses. We may not be able to timely complete our future strategic growth initiatives or within our anticipated cost estimates, if at all. As part of our efforts to grow our hashrate and remain competitive in the market, we have acquired facilities, entered into new and re-negotiated purchased power agreements and invested in additional new and used mining equipment. We are also reliant on third parties for our expansion efforts, including construction contractors and providers of infrastructure equipment, who may be burdened by delays in manufacturing, supply chain problems, less access to capital due to macro economic-conditions, or inflation. This could increase our costs and/or delay our expansion and acquisition efforts. If we are unable to complete our planned expansions or acquisitions on schedule and within our anticipated cost estimates, our deployment of newly purchased miners may be delayed, which could affect our competitiveness and our results of operation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market price for our securities. We may experience increased compliance costs as a result of our strategic acquisitions. The financial statements and internal controls related to the Mawson Assets and the WAHA and SPRE Assets have not, historically, been required to be in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). Further, future strategic acquisitions could carry substantial compliance burdens, which may limit our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, and which may require our management and personnel to shift their focus to such compliance burdens and away from their other functions. Such increased costs and compliance burdens could affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of such strategic acquisitions, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may suffer as a result. In the future, we may require additional financing to sustain and expand our operations, and we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects. 16 Our ability to operate profitably and to grow our business is dependent upon, among other things, generating sufficient revenue from our operations and, when and if needed, obtaining financing. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to operate and/or expand our business, we will be required to raise additional capital to fund operating deficits (if applicable) and growth of our business, pursue our business plans and to finance our operating activities, including through equity or debt financings, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain capital through sales of bitcoin would also be impacted by declines in the price of bitcoin. We have raised capital to finance our strategic growth of our business through public offerings of our common stock, including through our at-the-market offering program, and we expect to need to raise additional capital through similar public offerings to finance the completion of current and future expansion initiatives. Utilizing those sources may be more challenging in the current financial market conditions, in particular where trading volume is diminished. We may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could impair our growth and adversely impact our existing operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, stockholder ownership interest in the Company may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights as a stockholder. Debt and equity financings, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as redeeming our shares of common stock, making investments, incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. We maintain our cash at financial institutions, which at times, exceed federally insured limits. The majority of our cash is held in accounts at U.S. banking institutions that we believe are of high quality. Cash held in non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing operating accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. If such banking institutions were to fail, we could lose all or a portion of those amounts held in excess of such insurance limitations. The impact of geopolitical and economic events on the demand for bitcoin is uncertain. Geopolitical crises may trigger large-scale purchases of bitcoin, which could rapidly increase their prices. This may, however, also increase the likelihood of a subsequent price swing in the opposite direction as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, ultimately decreasing the value of bitcoins or any other digital asset in our possession. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in generally uncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold. Alternatively, global crises and economic downturns may discourage investment in bitcoin and digital assets in general as investors shift their investments towards less volatile asset classes. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. The value of bitcoin has historically been subject to wide swings. Because we do not currently hedge our investment in bitcoin and do not intend to for the foreseeable future, we are directly exposed to bitcoin’s price volatility and surrounding risks. While bitcoin prices are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms, they have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoins, the maintenance and development of the software protocol of the bitcoin network, changes in consumer demographics and public tastes, fraudulent or illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Furthermore, pricing may be the result of, and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of bitcoin, or our share price, making prices more volatile. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell bitcoin that we hold, or the number of bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell bitcoins are currently determined by management by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time. Such decisions, however well-informed, 17 may result in untimely sales and even losses, adversely affecting an investment in us. At this time, we do not anticipate engaging in any hedging activities related to our holding of bitcoin; this would expose us to substantial decreases in the price of bitcoin. The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or other alternatives. The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to abandon bitcoin. As we exclusively mine, and expect to exclusively mine bitcoin, we could face difficulty adapting to emergent digital ledgers, blockchains, or alternatives thereto. This could prevent us from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account and harm investors. Bitcoin is subject to halving; the reward for successfully solving a block will halve several times in the future and its value may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction in the rewards we receive from our mining efforts. Halving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm. In an event referred to as bitcoin “halving,” the bitcoin reward for mining any block is cut in half. For example, the mining reward for bitcoin declined from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoin on May 11, 2020. This process is scheduled to occur once every 210,000 blocks, or roughly four years, until the total amount of bitcoin rewards issued reaches 21 million, which is expected to occur around 2140. Once 21 million bitcoin are generated, the network will stop producing more. Currently, there are more than 19 million bitcoin in circulation. While bitcoin prices have had a history of price fluctuations around halving events, there is no guarantee that the price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the price of bitcoin does not follow these anticipated halving events, the revenue from our mining operations would decrease, and we may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease mining operations altogether, which may adversely affect an investment in us. Furthermore, such reductions in bitcoin rewards for uncovering blocks may result in a reduction in the aggregate hashrate of the bitcoin network as the incentive for miners decreases. Miners ceasing operations would reduce the collective processing power on the network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions and make the bitcoin network more vulnerable to malicious actors or botnets obtaining control in excess of 50 % of the processing power active on the blockchain. Such events may adversely affect our activities and an investment in us. Our reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may adversely affect an investment in us. We currently rely on Foundry Digital’s (“pool”), open access mining pool that support bitcoin, to receive our mining rewards and fees from the network. Our pool has the sole discretion to modify the terms of our agreement at any time, and, therefore, our future rights and relationship with our pool may change. In general, mining pools allow miners to combine their computing and processing power, increasing their chances of solving a block and getting rewarded by the bitcoin network. The rewards, distributed proportionally to our contribution to the pool’s overall mining power, are distributed by the pool operator. Should our pools’ operator systems suffer downtime due to a cyber-attack, software malfunction or other similar issues, it will negatively impact our ability to mine and receive revenue. Furthermore, while we receive daily reports from our pools detailing the total processing power provided to the pools and the proportion of that total processing power, we provided to determine the distribution of rewards to us, we are dependent on the accuracy of our pool’s record keeping. Therefore, we have little means of recourse against our pools’ operators if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by the mining pool operator is incorrect, other than leaving the pools. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our pools, we may experience reduced rewards for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations. Forks in the bitcoin network may occur in the future, which may affect the value of bitcoins held by us. A small group of contributors can propose refinements or improvements to the bitcoin network’s source code that alter the protocols and software that govern the bitcoin network and the properties of bitcoin, including the 18 irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new bitcoin. This is known as a “fork.” In the event a developer or group of developers proposes modifications to the bitcoin network that are not accepted by a majority of miners and users, but that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial plurality of miners and users, two or more competing and incompatible blockchain implementations could result. This is known as a “hard fork.” The value of bitcoin after the creation of a fork is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, the value of the fork product, market reaction to the creation of the fork product, and the occurrence of forks in the future. As such, existing forks, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, and future forks may have a negative effect on bitcoin’s value and may adversely affect an investment in us. The open-source structure of the bitcoin network protocol means that the contributors to the protocol are generally not directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the protocol. A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the bitcoin network and an investment in us. As an open-source project, bitcoin does not generate revenues for its contributors, and contributors are generally not compensated for maintaining and updating the bitcoin network protocol. The lack of guaranteed financial incentives for contributors to maintain or develop the bitcoin network and the lack of guaranteed resources to adequately address emerging issues with the bitcoin network may reduce incentives to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner. To the extent that contributors may fail to adequately update and maintain the bitcoin network protocol, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. Banks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities. A number of companies that engage in bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions. To the extent that such events may happen to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. Bitcoins held by us are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections. We do not hold our bitcoins with a banking institution or a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”), and, therefore, our bitcoins are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions. As a result, we may suffer a loss with respect to our bitcoins that is not covered by insurance, and we may not be able to recover any of our carried value in these bitcoins if they are lost or stolen or suffer significant and sustained reduction in conversion spot price. If we are not otherwise able to recover damages from a malicious actor in connection with these losses, our business and results of operations may suffer, which may have a material negative impact on our stock price. Bitcoins we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access. There is a risk that some or all of our bitcoins could be lost or stolen. Bitcoins are stored in and accessed by cryptocurrency sites commonly referred to as “wallets.” A hot wallet refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the Internet. Generally, hot wallets are easier to set up and access than wallets in cold storage, but they are also more susceptible to hackers and other technical vulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold storage is generally more secure than hot storage, but is not ideal for quick or regular transactions. When we keep our bitcoin in cold storage, we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of our cryptocurrency assets. We currently mine bitcoin by contributing to and benefiting from our pools’ processing power. Our share of bitcoins mined from our pools are initially received by us in wallets we control, which are maintained by Coinbase Inc., a U.S. based digital assets exchange. We currently sell the majority of the bitcoin we mine and utilize hot wallets to hold this 19 bitcoin immediately prior to selling for working capital purposes. We hold any remainder of our bitcoin in cold storage. Bitcoins we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access. Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure bitcoins, such as by attacking the bitcoin network source code, exchange miners, third-party platforms (including Coinbase), cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of substantial holdings of bitcoin, and as we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments and profitability. If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on the bitcoin network, such actor or botnet could manipulate the network to adversely affect us, which would adversely affect an investment in us. If a malicious actor or botnet, a collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers, obtains over 50% of the processing power dedicated to mining bitcoin, such actor may be able to construct fraudulent blocks or prevent certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at all. The malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the order of transactions, though it could not generate new units or transactions using such control. The malicious actor could also “double-spend,” or spend the same bitcoin in more than one transaction, or it could prevent transactions from being validated. In certain instances, reversing any fraudulent or malicious changes made to the bitcoin blockchain may not be possible. Although there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of blockchains achieved through controlling over 50% of the processing power on the bitcoin network, it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded, and could exceed, the 50% threshold on the bitcoin network. This possibility creates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of bitcoin transactions. To the extent that the bitcoin ecosystem, and the administrators of mining pools, do not have adequate controls and responses in place, the risk of a malicious actor obtaining control of the processing power may increase. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account and harm investors. The loss or destruction of private keys required to access our bitcoins may be irreversible. Our loss of access to our private keys or our experience of a data loss relating to our bitcoins could adversely affect an investment in us. Bitcoins may only be controlled by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which they are held. We publish the public key relating to digital wallets in use when we verify the receipt or transfers of bitcoins to and from our wallets and disseminate such information into the network on an anonymous basis, but we safeguard the private keys relating to such digital wallets. Digital asset exchanges, such as Coinbase, where we hold our bitcoin, engage in similar practices. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our bitcoins and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our bitcoins whether by us or digital asset exchanges where we hold our bitcoin, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. The digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, trade are relatively new and largely unregulated, and thus may be exposed to fraud and failure. Such failures may result in a reduction in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and can adversely affect an investment in us. Digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies trade are relatively new and, in most cases, largely unregulated. Many digital exchanges do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, cryptocurrency exchanges, including prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of the volume of digital asset trading. For example, in the first half of 2022, each of Celsius Network, Voyager Digital Ltd., and Three Arrows Capital declared bankruptcy, resulting in a loss of confidence in participants of the digital asset ecosystem and negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly. In November 2022, FTX, the third largest digital asset exchange by volume at the time, halted customer withdrawals and shortly thereafter, FTX and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy. 20 In response to these events, the digital asset markets, including the market for bitcoin specifically, have experienced extreme price volatility and several other entities in the digital asset industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected, further undermining confidence in the digital assets markets and in bitcoin. These events have also negatively impacted the liquidity of the digital assets markets as certain entities affiliated with FTX engaged in significant trading activity. If the liquidity of the digital assets markets continues to be negatively impacted by these events, digital asset prices (including the price of bitcoin) may continue to experience significant volatility and confidence in the digital asset markets may be further undermined. These events are continuing to develop and it is not possible to predict at this time all of the risks that they may pose to us, our service providers or on the digital asset industry as a whole. A perceived lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to business failure, hackers or malware, government-mandated regulation, or fraud, may reduce confidence in digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in cryptocurrency values. These potential consequences of a digital asset exchange’s failure could adversely affect an investment in us. We may not have adequate sources of recovery if our digital assets are lost, stolen or destroyed. We rely on Coinbase to facilitate the custody of our bitcoins. If our bitcoins are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party, including Coinbase, liable to us, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy our claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for us might be limited, to the extent identifiable, to other responsible third parties (e.g., a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim of ours. Incorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoins may thus be irretrievable. While we exchange our bitcoins directly for U.S. dollars on Coinbase and do not presently use, or expect to use, our bitcoins for any other transactions other than limited payroll related payments, any incorrectly executed or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may still adversely affect our investments and assets. We may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on not only the price of bitcoin but our ability to mine bitcoin. A disruption of the Internet may adversely affect the mining and use of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. Generally, cryptocurrencies and our business of mining bitcoin is dependent upon the Internet. A significant disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt bitcoin’s network operations until the disruption is resolved and have an adverse effect on the price of bitcoin and our ability to mine bitcoin. The limited rights of legal recourse available to us expose us and our investors to the risk of loss of our bitcoins for which no person is liable. At this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative or prosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrency; though law enforcement agencies like the FBI have recovered stolen bitcoin, that recovery has required significant amounts of time. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations of and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. The sale of our bitcoins to pay for expenses at a time of low bitcoin prices could adversely affect an investment in us. We sell our bitcoins to pay for operating expenses and growth on an as-needed basis. Consequently, we may sell our bitcoins at a time when bitcoin prices are low, which could adversely affect an investment in us. At this time, we do not engage in contractual or financial hedging activities related to our bitcoin holdings to mitigate potential decreases in the price of bitcoin. See the above risk factor entitled, “The value of bitcoin has historically been subject to wide 21 swings. Because we do not currently hedge our investment in bitcoin and do not intend to for the foreseeable future, we are directly exposed to bitcoin’s price volatility and surrounding risks."" Demand for bitcoin is driven, in part, by its status as a prominent and secure cryptocurrency. It is possible that a cryptocurrency other than bitcoin could have features that make it more desirable to a material portion of the digital asset user base, resulting in a reduction in demand for bitcoins. Bitcoin holds a “first-to-market” advantage over other cryptocurrencies. This first-to-market advantage is driven in large part by having the largest user base and, more importantly, the largest combined mining power in use. Nonetheless, another form of cryptocurrency could become materially popular due to either a perceived or exposed shortcoming of the bitcoin network or a perceived advantage of another form of digital currency. If another form of digital currency obtains significant market share, this could reduce the interest in, and value of, bitcoin and the profitability of our bitcoin operations. Our mining costs may be in excess of our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business and adversely impact an investment in us. Mining operations are costly and our expenses may increase in the future. Increases in mining expenses may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue (i.e. the value of bitcoin mined). Our expenses may become greater than we anticipate, and our investments to make our business more cost-efficient may not succeed. Further, even if our expenses remain the same or decline, our revenues may not exceed our expenses to the extent the price of bitcoin continues to decrease without a corresponding decrease in bitcoin network difficulty. Increases in our costs without corresponding increases in our revenue would adversely affect our profitability and could seriously harm our business and an investment in us. The properties included in our mining operation may experience damages, including damages that may not be covered by insurance. Our current mining locations and any future sites we establish will be subject to a variety of risks relating to physical condition and operation, including but not limited to: Although our mining sites are equipped with standard security measures normally associated with a traditional data center, and insured by tier one insurance providers, our mining sites could still be rendered inoperable, temporarily or permanently, as a result of a fire or other natural disaster or by a terrorist or other events outside of our control. The measures we take to prevent and insure against these risks may not be sufficient or effective. We are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power. The operation of a bitcoin mining facility requires significant amounts of electrical power. Any mining site we currently operate or establish in the future can only be successful if we can continue to obtain sufficient electrical power for that site on a cost-effective basis. We currently have four fully-owned campuses and operate additional miners under two active hosting agreements, each of which have unique power agreements. Geopolitical events including the war in Ukraine and inflationary impacts have caused power prices to increase worldwide; if power prices continue to increase while bitcoin prices decrease, it would impact our ability to profitability mine bitcoin. We may curtail the energy used by our mining operations in times of heightened energy prices or in the case of a grid-wide electricity shortage either voluntarily or by agreement with utility providers. We may also encounter other 22 situations where utilities or government entities restrict or prohibit the provision of electricity to mining operations. In these cases, our ability to produce bitcoin may be negatively affected. Because we also expect to expand to additional sites, there may be significant competition for suitable locations with access to affordable power. Additionally, our facilities could be adversely affected by a power outage. Although we maintain limited backup power at certain sites, it would not be feasible to run miners on back-up power generators in the event of a government restriction on electricity or a power outage. To the extent we are unable to receive adequate power supply and are forced to reduce or cease our operations due to the availability or cost of electrical power, our business would be adversely affected. Further, one of our key strategies is to use sustainable and environmentally friendly sources of energy, including nuclear energy sources. To the extent we are unable to obtain sustainable sources of energy on a cost-effective basis and execute on this strategy, our business could be adversely affected. Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our ESG practices and the impacts of climate change may result in additional costs or risks. Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. In May 2021, the SEC proposed rule changes that would require public companies to include certain climate-related disclosures in their periodic reports, including information about climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on their business, results of operations, or financial condition, and certain climate-related financial statement metrics in a note to their audited financial statements. The SEC noted that such rule changes were proposed in response to investor demands for consistent and comparable data on climate change. Furthermore, increased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in increased public scrutiny of our business and our industry, and our management team may divert significant time and energy away from our operations and towards responding to such scrutiny and reassuring our employees. In addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and could increase our insurance and other operating costs, including, potentially, to repair damage incurred as a result of extreme weather events or to renovate or retrofit facilities to better withstand extreme weather events. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on our operations, or if our operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted. Our operations and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in cryptocurrencies. We compete with other users and/or companies that are mining cryptocurrencies and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed by or linked to cryptocurrencies. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrencies directly, which could limit the market for our shares and reduce their liquidity. The emergence of other financial vehicles and exchange-traded funds have increased scrutiny on cryptocurrencies, and such scrutiny could be applicable to us and impact our ability to successfully establish or maintain a public market for our securities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors. From time to time, as market conditions change, large holders of bitcoin may sell large amounts all at once into the market, thereby constraining the growth of the price of bitcoin. 23 There are very large holders of bitcoin, including other miners, that may choose or be forced to sell large quantities of bitcoin all at once or over a short period of time. Such an increase in selling volume could create downward pressure on the market price of bitcoin. Potential that, in the event of a bankruptcy filing by a custodian, bitcoin held in custody could be determined to be property of a bankruptcy estate and we could be considered a general unsecured creditor thereof. The treatment of bitcoins held by custodians that file for bankruptcy protection is uncharted territory in U.S. Bankruptcy law. We cannot say with certainty whether bitcoin held in custody by a bankrupt custodian would be treated as property of a bankruptcy estate and, accordingly, whether the owner of that bitcoin would be treated as a general unsecured creditor. There are risks related to technological obsolescence, the vulnerability of the global supply chain for cryptocurrency hardware disruption, and difficulty in obtaining new hardware which may have a negative effect on our business. As our mining facility operates, our miners experience ordinary wear and tear, and may also face more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors beyond our control. The degradation of our miners will require us to, over time, to repair or replace miners which are no longer functional. Additionally, as technology evolves, we may be required to acquire newer models of miners to remain competitive in the market. This upgrading process requires substantial capital investment, and we may face challenges in doing so on a timely and cost-effective basis. Further, the global supply of miners is unpredictable and presently heavily dependent on manufacturers headquartered in China, with manufacturing in Asia, which was severely affected by the emergence of the COVID-19 coronavirus global pandemic. We currently utilize several types of ASIC miners as part of our mining operation, including Bitmain Antminers, Canaan Avalon miners and MicroBT WhatsMiners, all of which are produced in China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Geopolitical matters, including the U.S. relationship with China, may impact our ability to import ASIC miners. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate replacement parts for our existing miners or obtain additional miners from manufacturers on a timely basis. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors. Since there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of digital assets, including bitcoin, it is unclear how we will be required to account for transactions involving digital assets. Because there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition and no official guidance has yet been provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC, it is unclear how companies may in the future be required to account for cryptocurrency transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards or interpretation by the SEC could result in changes in our accounting treatment and the necessity to restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could adversely impact the accounting for the bitcoins we hold and bitcoin transactions and, more generally, negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to grow our hashrate, we may be unable to compete, and our results of operations could suffer. Generally, a bitcoin miner’s chance of solving a block on the bitcoin blockchain and earning a Bitcoin reward is a function of the miner’s hashrate (i.e., the amount of computing power devoted to supporting the Bitcoin blockchain), relative to the global network hashrate. As demand for bitcoin has increased, the global network hashrate has increased, and to the extent more adoption of bitcoin occurs, we would expect the demand for bitcoin would increase, drawing more mining companies into the industry and further increasing the global network hashrate. As new and more powerful miners are deployed, the global network hashrate will continue to increase, meaning a miner’s percentage of the total daily rewards will decline unless it deploys additional hashrate at pace with the growth of global hashrate. Accordingly, to compete in this highly competitive industry, we believe we will need to continue to acquire new miners, both to replace those lost to ordinary wear-and-tear and other damage, and to increase our hashrate to keep up with a growing global network hashrate. 24 We plan to grow our hashrate, in part, by acquiring newer, more effective, and energy-efficient miners. These new miners are highly specialized servers that are very difficult to produce at scale. As a result, there are limited producers capable of producing large numbers of sufficiently effective miners. The cost of these miners is directly correlated to bitcoin prices and the profitability of bitcoin mining. Demand for new miners increased in response to increased bitcoin prices in 2021 followed by a decreased in demand due to falling bitcoin prices in 2022. We observed the price of these new miners followed changes in demand, resulting in elevated machine prices when bitcoin mining economics are high and significantly lower prices when these economics are strained. As a result, positive bitcoin economics may negatively impact our future equipment costs and the increase the competition to secure mining equipment. If we can’t acquire sufficient numbers of new miners or access sufficient capital to fund our acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect investments in our securities. Our business has been, and in the future may be, subject to risks arising from pandemic, epidemic, or an outbreak of diseases, such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. Since then, COVID-19 spread across the globe and impacted worldwide economic activity, including through quarantines, travel bans and restrictions, shelter-in-place orders, shutdowns of businesses, reductions in business activity, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. These measures impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, as well as the operations of our customers, our partners and our vendors and suppliers. Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, and many of our key suppliers, are located in regions which have been and continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Our suppliers worldwide have also been affected by COVID-19 and may continue to experience material impacts well beyond the end of the pandemic. Specifically, the manufacture of components of our products, the final assembly of our products, and other critical operations are concentrated in China and other geographic locations that have been impacted by COVID-19 and in which local governments continue to take measures to try to contain the pandemic. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. Such measures, as well as restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and other factors have adversely affected our supply chain, consistent with its effect across many industries, including creating shipping and logistics challenges and placing significant limits on component supplies. They have also significantly increased the costs of shipping miners, related components and infrastructure. We expect these impacts, including potentially delayed product availability, to continue for as long as the global supply chain is experiencing these challenges. In addition, while the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular are difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our working capital and liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall spending, adversely affecting demand for bitcoin, our business, and the value of our common stock. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, further related restrictions on travel, any reopening plans worldwide, the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, including, without limitation, the effectiveness and timing of vaccination initiatives in the United States and worldwide and the duration, timing, and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, even after the pandemic subsides worldwide, could have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of 25 operations, access to sources of capital and financial condition, though the full extent and duration of any such impact is also uncertain. Global economic conditions, including continuing or worsening inflationary issues and associated changes in monetary policy and potential economic recession, and geopolitical events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the subsequent imposition of sanctions as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. General economic and political conditions such as economic recessions, interest rates, rising inflation, commodity prices, foreign currency fluctuations, international tariffs, social, political and economic risks, hostilities or the perception that hostilities may be imminent, military conflict and acts of war, including further escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the related response, including sanctions or other restrictive actions, by the United States and/or other countries could adversely impact our business, supply chain or partners. While the price of bitcoin miners has dropped as the price of bitcoin has dropped, the U.S. inflation rate has steadily increased since 2021 and into 2022. These inflationary pressures, as well as disruptions in our supply chain, have increased the costs of most other goods, services and personnel, which have in turn caused our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. Sustained levels of high inflation caused the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to increase interest rates, which have raised the cost of acquiring capital and reduced economic growth, either of which—or the combination thereof—could hurt the financial and operating results of our business. In addition, the extent and duration of the situation in Ukraine, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be significant. The effects of such global economic conditions, including continuing or worsening inflationary issues and associated changes in monetary policy or potential economic recession, and geopolitical events could adversely affect our ability to access the capital and other financial markets, and if so, we may need to consider alternative sources of funding for some of our growth and operations and for working capital, which may increase our cost of, as well as adversely impact our access to, capital. Divestitures and discontinued operations could negatively impact our business, and retained liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial results. In connection with the execution of our strategy to focus entirely on bitcoin mining, we have completed several divestitures, including the divestiture of a part of our former energy business. We intend to make further dispositions in connection with our non-bitcoin mining related businesses, which we may not be able to complete on favorable terms or at all. If we do not realize the expected benefits of these divestitures or our post-completion liabilities and continuing obligations are substantial and exceed our expectations, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. As a result of such dispositions, bitcoin mining is now the sole driver of our business and revenues and is expected to continue to be the source of substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, which has the effect of increasing our exposure to the risks described in this Annual Report. Further, in the course of our discontinued operations, we may become subject to legal actions based on a claim that our legacy energy products are or were defective in workmanship or have caused personal or other injuries. We may also be subject to lawsuits and other claims in the future if our legacy products or installed systems malfunction, including, for example, if any of our energy system offerings (such as installed racking systems, photovoltaic modules, batteries, inverters, or other products) causes injuries. Because energy systems and many of our other current and anticipated products are electricity-producing devices, it is possible that customers or their property could be injured or damaged by our products, whether due to product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. Further, since our products are used in systems that are made up of components sourced from third party manufacturers, we may be subject to product liability claims even if our products do not malfunction. Additionally, any of our products could be subject to recalls due to product malfunctions or defects. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages that could require us to make significant payments, as well as subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position. We rely on third-party manufacturing warranties, warranties provided by our manufacturing partners and our general liability insurance to cover product liability claims and have not obtained separate product 26 liability insurance. Such warranties and insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims. Moreover, even if such warranties and insurance coverage are sufficient, any successful claim could significantly harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Enforcement Operations If regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require our registration as a money services business (an “MSB”) under the regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”), or otherwise under state laws, we may incur significant compliance costs, which could be substantial or cost-prohibitive. If we become subject to these regulations, our costs in complying with them may have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations. To the extent our bitcoin mining activities cause us to be deemed an MSB under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the BSA, we may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate us to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records. To the extent that our cryptocurrency activities cause us to be deemed a “money transmitter” ​(an “MT”) or be given an equivalent designation, under state law in any state in which we operate, we may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. Currently, the New York State Department of Financial Services maintains a comprehensive “BitLicense” framework for businesses that conduct “virtual currency business activity.” In July 2020, Louisiana enacted the Virtual Currency Businesses Act, becoming the second state after New York to enact a stand-alone virtual currency law. We will continue to monitor for developments in state-level legislation, guidance or regulations applicable to us. Such additional federal or state regulatory obligations in the United States or obligations that could arise under the regulatory frameworks of other countries may cause us to incur significant expenses, possibly affecting its business and financial condition in a material and adverse manner. Furthermore, we and our service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to MSBs and MTs or similar obligations in other countries. If we are deemed to be subject to such additional regulatory and registration or licensing requirements, we may be required to substantially alter our bitcoin mining activities and possibly cease engaging in such activities. Any such action may adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and an investment in our company. Current regulation regarding the exchange of bitcoins under the CEA by the CFTC is unclear; to the extent we become subject to regulation by the CFTC in connection with our exchange of bitcoin, we may incur additional compliance costs, which may be significant. The Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the “CEA”), does not currently impose any direct obligations on us related to the mining or exchange of bitcoins. Generally, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), the federal agency that administers the CEA, regards bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as commodities. This position has been supported by decisions of federal courts. However, the CEA imposes requirements relative to certain transactions involving bitcoin and other digital assets that constitute a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option on such a contract), a swap, or a transaction involving margin, financing or leverage that does not result in actual delivery of the commodity within 28 days to persons not defined as “eligible contract participants” or “eligible commercial entities” under the CEA (e.g., retail persons). Changes in the CEA or the regulations promulgated by the CFTC thereunder, as well as interpretations thereof and official promulgations by the CFTC, may impact the classification of bitcoins and, therefore, may subject them to additional regulatory oversight by the agency. Although to date the CFTC has not enacted regulations governing non-derivative or non-financed, margined or leveraged transactions in bitcoin, it has authority to commence enforcement actions against persons who violate certain prohibitions under the CEA related to transactions in any contract of sale of any commodity, including bitcoin, in interstate commerce (e.g., manipulation and engaging in certain deceptive practices). 27 We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins under the law. Any requirements imposed by the CFTC related to our mining activities or our transactions in bitcoin could cause us to incur additional extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company. In addition, changes in the classification of bitcoins could subject us, as a result of our bitcoin mining operations, to additional regulatory oversight by the agency. Although to date the CFTC has not enacted regulations governing non-derivative or non-financed, margined or leveraged transactions in bitcoin, it has authority to commence enforcement actions against persons who violate certain prohibitions under the CEA related to transactions in any contract of sale of any commodity, including bitcoin, in interstate commerce (e.g., manipulation and engaging in certain deceptive practices). Moreover, if our mining activities or transactions in bitcoin were deemed by the CFTC to constitute a collective investment in derivatives for our shareholders, we may be required to register as a commodity pool operator with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in the Company. While no provision of the CEA, or CFTC rules, orders or rulings (except as noted herein) appears to be currently applicable to our business, this is subject to change. If the SEC or another regulatory body considers bitcoin to be a security under U.S. securities laws, we may be required to comply with significant SEC registration and/or other requirements. In general, novel or unique assets such as bitcoin and other digital assets may be classified as securities if they meet the definition of investment contracts under U.S. law. In recent years, the offer and sale of digital assets other than bitcoin, most notably Kik Interactive Inc.’s Kin tokens and Telegram Group Inc.’s TON tokens, have been deemed to be investment contracts by the SEC. While we believe that bitcoin is unlikely to be considered an investment contract, and thus a security under the investment contract definition, we cannot provide any assurances that digital assets that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, including bitcoin, will never be classified as securities under U.S. law. This would obligate us to comply with registration and other requirements by the SEC and, therefore, cause us to incur significant, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company. It may be illegal now, or in the future, to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize similar cryptocurrency assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which could adversely affect us. Although currently cryptocurrencies generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, several countries, such as China, India and Russia, may continue taking regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell or use these cryptocurrency assets or to exchange for local currency. For example, in China and Russia (India is currently proposing new legislation), it is illegal to accept payment in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrencies. In addition, in March 2021, the governmental authorities for the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia banned bitcoin mining in the province due to the industry’s intense electrical power demands and its negative environmental impacts. If other countries, including the U.S., implement similar restrictions, such restrictions may adversely affect us. For example, in New York State, a moratorium on certain bitcoin mining operations that run on carbon-based power sources was signed into law on November 22, 2022. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and thus harm investors. Changing environmental regulation and public energy policy may expose our business to new risks. Our bitcoin mining operations require a substantial amount of power and can only be successful, and ultimately profitable, if the costs we incur, including for electricity, are lower than the revenue we generate from our operations. As a result, any mine we establish can only be successful if we can obtain sufficient electrical power for that mine on a cost-effective basis, and our establishment of new mines requires us to find locations where that is the 28 case. For instance, our plans and strategic initiatives for expansion are based, in part, on our understanding of current environmental and energy regulations, policies, and initiatives enacted by federal, New York State and Georgia State regulators. If new regulations are imposed, or if existing regulations are modified, the assumptions we made underlying our plans and strategic initiatives may be inaccurate, and we may incur additional costs to adapt our planned business, if we are able to adapt at all, to such regulations. In addition, there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty for our business because the bitcoin mining industry, with its high energy demand, may become a target for future environmental and energy regulation. New legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. Further, any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. For example, the recently passed legislation in the state of New York imposing a moratorium on certain bitcoin mining operations that run carbon-based power. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be addressed, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Future developments regarding the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax purposes could adversely impact our business. Due to the new and evolving nature of digital assets and the absence of comprehensive legal guidance with respect to digital assets and related transactions, many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax treatment of transactions involving digital assets, such as the purchase and sale of bitcoin and the receipt of staking rewards and other digital asset incentives and rewards products, are uncertain, and it is unclear what guidance may be issued in the future with respect to the tax treatment of digital assets and related transactions. Current IRS guidance indicates that for U.S. federal income tax purposes digital assets such as bitcoins should be treated and taxed as property, and that transactions involving the payment of bitcoins for goods and services should be treated in effect as barter transactions. The IRS has also released guidance to the effect that, under certain circumstances, hard forks of digital currencies are taxable events giving rise to taxable income and guidance with respect to the determination of the tax basis of digital currency. However, current IRS guidance does not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets and related transactions. Moreover, although current IRS guidance addresses the treatment of certain forks, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of income inclusions for various crypto asset transactions, including, but not limited to, staking rewards and other crypto asset incentives and rewards products. While current IRS guidance creates a potential tax reporting requirement for any circumstance where the ownership of a bitcoin passes from one person to another, it preserves the right to apply capital gains treatment to those transactions, which is generally favorable for investors in bitcoin. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not alter its existing position with respect to digital assets in the future or that other state, local and non-U.S. taxing authorities or courts will follow the approach of the IRS with respect to the treatment of digital assets such as bitcoins for income tax and sales tax purposes. Any such alteration of existing guidance or issuance of new or different guidance may have negative consequences including the imposition of a greater tax burden on investors in bitcoin or imposing a greater cost on the acquisition and disposition of bitcoin, generally; in either case potentially having a negative effect on the trading price of bitcoin or otherwise negatively impacting our business. In addition, future technological and operational developments that may arise with respect to digital currencies may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital currencies for U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax purposes. 29 The open-source structure of the bitcoin network protocol means that the contributors to the protocol are generally not directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the protocol. A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the bitcoin network and an investment in us. As an open-source project, bitcoin does not generate revenues for its contributors, and contributors are generally not compensated for maintaining and updating the bitcoin network protocol. The lack of guaranteed financial incentives for contributors to maintain or develop the bitcoin network and the lack of guaranteed resources to adequately address emerging issues with the bitcoin network may reduce incentives to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner. To the extent that contributors may fail to adequately update and maintain the bitcoin network protocol, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. Banks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities. A number of companies that engage in bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions. To the extent that such events may happen to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. Our interactions with the bitcoin network may expose us to SDN or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distributed ledger technology. The Office of Financial Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the US Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its specially designated nationals (“SDN”) list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. We also may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the persons with whom we transact. Risks Related to Our Securities The price of our common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate widely, which could result in substantial losses for investors. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: 30 In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Specifically, the trading price of our common stock has already been correlated, and, in the future, as we continue to expand our bitcoin mining business, may be increasingly correlated, to the trading prices of bitcoin. Bitcoin companies' stock have shown volatility relative to bitcoin, with many such stocks outperforming bitcoin in 2020 and 2021, but underperforming relative to bitcoin in 2022. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency market prices, which have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors (including those discussed herein), are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms. As noted elsewhere herein, while we had no direct exposure to FTX, the failure or insolvency of large exchanges like FTX may cause the price of bitcoin to fall and decrease confidence in the ecosystem, which could negatively impact our stock price. Furthermore, such prices may be subject to factors such as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to additional influence from fraudulent or illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Pricing may be the result of, and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of bitcoin, or our share price, inflating and making their market prices more. For example, the closing sales price of our common stock on January 3, 2022 was $9.59 and the closing price of bitcoin was $46,458 and, as of September 30, 2022, our closing sales price of our common stock was $3.18, and the closing price of Bitcoin was $19,431. In addition, the stock markets in general have often experienced volatility, including, most recently, in the wake of COVID-19, that has sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations have caused, and may continue to cause, the trading price of our common stock to decline. A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital, on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects, and on the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type may be expensive to defend and may divert our management’s attention and resources from the operation of our business. We have the right to designate and issue additional shares of preferred stock. If we were to designate and/or issue additional preferred stock, it is likely to have rights, preferences and privileges that may adversely affect the common stock. We are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of blank-check Preferred Stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix for any series the dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights, and other rights, preferences and privileges for the Preferred Stock. Currently, 2,000,000 shares are designated as Series A Preferred Stock, of which 1,750,000 shares are outstanding. The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock entitled to have the Company redeem each share of Series A Preferred Stock for three shares of our common stock only if a change of control event (as defined in the certificate of designation) occurs, and they are entitled to vote together with the holders of the Company’s common stock on all matters submitted to stockholders at a rate of forty-five (45) votes for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held. The issuance of shares of Preferred Stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the Preferred Stock, could reduce the voting rights and powers of the common stock and the portion of our assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution in the book value per share of the common stock. The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, to the detriment of the investors in the common stock offered hereby. We cannot assure that we will not, under certain circumstances, issue shares of our Preferred Stock. 31 We are currently the subject of a shareholder class action, and may be subject to shareholder litigation in the future; our costs of defending such litigation, arbitration and other proceedings and any adverse outcome of such litigation, arbitration or other proceeding may have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations. We are currently, and may from time to time in the future be, involved in and subject to material litigation and other legal proceedings. In particular, on January 20, 2021, a purported shareholder of our company, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated (together, the “Class”), filed a putative class action complaint (the “Class Complaint”) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain members of our executive management team. The Class Complaint alleges that, between December 31, 2020 and January 14, 2021, we and certain members of our executive management team failed to disclose certain material information to investors and that, as a result of the foregoing, our positive statements about our business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. The claims made in the Class Complaint appear to be derived from a short seller report that was published about us. We have financed our strategic growth primarily by issuing new shares of our common stock in public offerings, which dilutes the ownership interests of our current stockholders, and which may adversely affect the market price of our securities. We have raised capital to finance our strategic growth of our business through public offerings of our common stock, including through our at-the-market offering program, and we expect to need to raise additional capital through similar public offerings to finance the completion of current and future expansion initiatives. Utilizing those sources may be more challenging in the current financial market conditions, in particular where trading volume is diminished. We may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could impair our growth and adversely impact our existing operations. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and the per share value of our common stock could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, the holders of any debt we issue would likely have priority over the holders of shares of our common stock in terms of order of payment preference. We may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or take other actions including terms that require us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios that could otherwise not be in the interests of our stockholders. We have not paid dividends on shares of our common stock in the past and have no immediate plans to pay do so in the future. We have not paid, and do not plan to pay, any cash dividends with respect to our common stock in the immediate future. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to market our products and to cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We cannot assure stockholders that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, stockholders should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock. If securities or industry analysts do not publish or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us now or in the future issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations. In April 2022, we entered into a Master Equipment Financing Agreement with Trinity Capital Inc., as the lender (the “Financing Agreement”). The Financing Agreement provides for up to $35 million of borrowings to finance our acquisition of blockchain computing equipment. We received a loan of $20 million at close, with the remaining $15 32 million fundable upon our request no later than December 31, 2022, As of the date of this filing $16,058,383 in principal is outstanding and due to Trinity Capital Inc. Our indebtedness could: increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; result in greater interest rate risk and volatility; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including our obligation to repay our Financing Agreement under certain circumstances, or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all. We incur significant costs and demands upon management and accounting and finance resources as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies; any failure to establish and maintain adequate internal controls and/or disclosure controls or to recruit, train and retain necessary accounting and finance personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to accurately and timely prepare our financial statements and otherwise make timely and accurate public disclosure. As a public company, we incur significant administrative, legal, accounting and other burdens and expenses beyond those of a private company, including public company reporting obligations and Nasdaq listing requirements. In particular, we have needed, and continue to need, to enhance and supplement our internal accounting resources with additional accounting and finance personnel with the requisite technical and public company experience and expertise to enable us to satisfy such reporting obligations. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls (including internal control over financial reporting) could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis, or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose us to regulatory enforcement action and shareholder claims. Furthermore, as a non-accelerated filer under the Exchange Act, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, but we are required to document and test our internal control procedures and prepare annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Therefore, our internal controls over financial reporting will not receive the level of review provided by the process relating to the auditor attestation included in annual reports of issuers that are subject to the auditor attestation requirements, which may adversely impact market perception of our business and our common shares. Our assessments must include disclosure of identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting. Testing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting involves significant costs and could divert management’s attention from other matters that are important to our business. Additionally, we may not be successful in remediating any deficiencies that may be identified. If we are unable to remediate any such deficiencies or otherwise fail to establish and maintain adequate accounting systems and internal control over financial reporting, or we are unable to continue to recruit, train and retain necessary accounting and finance personnel, we may not be able to accurately and timely prepare our financial statements and otherwise satisfy our public reporting obligations. During our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 and concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, our internal controls were effective. Any inaccuracies in our financial statements or other public disclosures (in particular, if resulting in the need to restate previously filed financial statements), or delays in our making required SEC filings, whether as a result of our internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the confidence in our financial reporting, our credibility in the marketplace and the trading price of our common shares. 33 We qualify as a smaller reporting company, and, under the smaller reporting company rules, we are subject to scaled disclosure requirements that may make it more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects. Currently, we qualify as a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. We have elected to provide disclosure under the smaller reporting company rules and, therefore, are subject to decreased disclosure obligations in our filings with the SEC, including being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements in our annual reports. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects. Provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions. Members of our Board of Directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws as authorized by the Nevada Revised Statutes. Specifically, Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a director or officer is not individually liable to the company or its shareholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer unless it is proven that (1) the directors or officers act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and (2) his or her breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This provision is intended to afford directors and officers protection against and to limit their potential liability for monetary damages resulting from suits alleging a breach of the duty of care by a director or officer. Accordingly, stockholders may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their fiduciary duty of care. In addition, our Bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if one were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses they incurred in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties On October 8, 2022, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC, closed on the acquisition of a lease for real property and the purchase of tangible property located at 2015 George J. Lyons, Sandersville, Georgia 31082. The property is located in Washington County and consists of 41 existing modular data centers. The Company intends to utilize the property to conduct its bitcoin mining activities. On August 17, 2022, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, CSRE Properties Washington, LLC, closed on the purchase of real property located at 197 Dixie Wood Road, Washington, Georgia, 30673 (the ""Washington Property""). The total purchase price was $15,000,000 and the seller conveyed fee simple title by limited warranty deed. The property is located in Wilkes County, Georgia and contains approximately 27 acres. The Company intends to utilize the property to conduct its bitcoin mining activities. On August 6, 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, closed on the purchase of real property located at 5295 Brook Hollow Parkway, Norcross, Georgia, 30071 (the “Norcross Property”). The total purchase price was $6,550,000 and the seller conveyed fee simple title by limited warranty deed. The Norcross Property consists of an office building of approximately 86,000 square feet on approximately 7 acres of land. The Norcross Property is utilized by CleanBlok to conduct bitcoin mining activities. 34 On May 20, 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary ATL, closed on the purchase of real property located at 2380 Godby Road, College Park, Georgia, 30349 (the “Godby Road Property”), which it had been leasing prior to the purchase. The total purchase price was $4,711,799 and the seller conveyed fee simple title by limited warranty deed. The Godby Road Property consists of an office/warehouse building of approximately 41,387 square feet on approximately 6 acres of land. The Godby Road Property is utilized by ATL and CleanBlok to conduct bitcoin mining activities. On June 15, 2021, the Company entered into a lease for warehouse and office space at 2042 Corte Del Nogal, Suite C, Carlsbad, California, 92011. The 5-year lease is for an approximately 12,704 square foot industrial unit and part of a larger 47,744 square foot multi-tenant industrial flex building and requires monthly base rent payments of $11,307. The leased property was utilized by our energy business, and we intend to identify a suitable sublessor once we are no longer utilizing the space. On August 26, 2021, the Company entered into a lease for office space at 2370 Corporate Circle, Suite 160, Henderson, Nevada, 89074. The 65-month lease is for 4,552 rentable square feet an initial base rent of $10,925 and increases 3% each year. The Corporate Circle space is utilized as the CleanSpark corporate and executive headquarters. We also have an office located at 1185 S. 1800 W, Suite 3, Woods Cross Utah 84087. We are currently on a year-to-year lease agreement that calls for us to make payments of $2,300 per month. This property is utilized by corporate employees. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to litigation, claims, investigations and audits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see footnote 15 pertaining to commitments and contingencies included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Item 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as anticipate, estimate, plan, project, continuing, ongoing, expect, believe, intend, may, will, should, could, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. See ""Forward-Looking Statements."" Business Overview We are a sustainable bitcoin mining operator that owns and operates facilities as well as holds contracts with co-location and hosting operators. A bitcoin mining company uses specialized computers to verify transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. Without mining, there would be no bitcoin. Prior to June 2022, we also operated in a specialized energy industry that provided advanced energy technology solutions to commercial and residential customers. Effective June 30, 2022, the Company deemed its energy operations to be discontinued operations due to its strategic decision to strictly focus on its bitcoin mining operations and divest of its energy assets. Accordingly, the Company now solely operates in one business segment. The energy segment has now been classified as held-for-sale and will be discussed in this management discussion & analysis within the ""Results of Discontinued Operations"" section. On November 18, 2022, we disposed of the majority of our intellectual property and software related to the energy segment. We are currently working to sell the remaining assets and inventory of the energy segment, but currently plan to maintain ownership of the patents related to the gasifier technology. Results of Operations for the Year Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 Bitcoin Mining Operations Bitcoin mining revenue We earned $130,999,686 in revenues during the year ended September 30, 2022, which was an increase of $92,153,053, or 237%, as compared with $38,846,633 in revenues for the year ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to increase in revenues from our bitcoin mining operations. Bitcoin mining revenues are determined by two main drivers; quantity of bitcoin mined and the price of bitcoin on the date the bitcoin is mined. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we mined 3,752 bitcoin with an average bitcoin price of $34,916 as compared to 899 bitcoin with an average bitcoin price of $43,232 during the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in the quantity of bitcoin mined is primarily based on the increased number of miners in operation which increased to approximately 42,000 as of September 30, 2022. The increase in miners in operation increases our hashrate, which is our total computational power, and which when understood in the context of global hashrate, determines how much bitcoin we are able to mine. Other services revenues Other services revenues pertain to our data center operations for which we earned $524,759 in revenue from our data center operation for the year ended September 30, 2022, which is an increase of $84,287, or 19% as compared to $440,472 for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was due to a full year of data center operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, whereas the prior fiscal year saw data center operations begin in December 2020 as the result of the ATL acquisition. Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense) Our cost of revenues were $41,233,650 for the year ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $35,970,621, or 683%, as compared with cost of revenues of $5,263,029 for the year ended September 30, 2021. These costs were primarily related to energy costs to operate the mining equipment within our owned facilities, which was $13,554,648 for the 37 year ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $10,610,995 as compared to $2,943,653 for the year ended September 30, 2021. We also incurred hosting fees of $22,707,539 for the year ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $20,761,197 as compared to $1,946,342 for the year ended September 30, 2021, which was the result of our co-location agreement with Coinmint. The increases in both utilities and hosting fees were due to the increases in the volume of mining equipment installed in both our owned and co-locations as well as a general increase in the cost of each MW utilized. Professional fees Professional fees, which consists primarily of legal, accounting and consulting fees, were $6,469,064 for the year ended September 30, 2022, a slight decrease of $68,998, or 1%, from $6,538,062 for the year ended September 30, 2021. Legal expenses were $2,713,726 for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $4,496,482 in the prior year. Other professional fees, namely accounting, audit and consulting, were $3,755,338 for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to $2,041,580 for the year ended September 30, 2021 an increase of $1,713,758. This increase was primarily attributable to additional activity in litigation and transactional costs. Payroll expenses Payroll expenses increased to $40,920,163 for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $21,181,905 for the same period ended September 30, 2021. Our payroll expenses include all compensation related expenses for our employees and mainly includes salaries, wages, payroll related taxes and benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation. Payroll expenses were $9,492,676 the year ended September 30, 2022, representing a decrease of 29% from $13,450,299 in the prior year ended September 30, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the Company’s exit from the energy business, some costs of which were classified as discontinued operations. We grant stock-based awards to certain employees as a significant portion of our payroll related costs. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, was $31,464,994 for the year ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $22,918,282, or 268%, from $8,546,712 the prior year ended September 30, 2021. General and administrative expenses General and administrative fees increased to $10,422,716 for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $5,716,465 for the same period ended September 30, 2021, representing an increase of $4,706,251. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in corporate overhead including, but not limited to, insurance premiums, travel expenses and rent expenses. Other impairment expense (related to bitcoin) Impairment expense in the amount of $12,210,269 was recognized for the year ended September 30, 2022 an increase of $5,602,193 as compared to $6,608,076 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The impairment expense consists of bitcoin impairments due to the general decrease in bitcoin prices during the year. Decreases in bitcoin prices for periods subsequent to the mining date are recorded as impairment expense. ASC Topic 350 - Goodwill and Other requires subsequent increases in bitcoin prices are not allowed to be recorded (unrealized gains) unless the bitcoin is sold, at which point the gain is recognized. Realized gain on sale of bitcoin Realized gain on sale of bitcoin decreased to $2,567,101 for the year ended September 30, 2022 from a realized gain of $3,104,378 for the year ended September 30, 2021 due to the decrease in bitcoin prices during the period. Depreciation and amortization 38 Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $49,044,877 for the year ended September 30, 2022, from $8,982,123 for the same period ended September 30, 2021, an increase of $40,062,754. Depreciation expense increased by $39,676,525, or 536%, during the year ended September 30, 2022, to $47,081,550 from $7,405,025 due to increase in mining related equipment being placed in service during the comparative period. Amortization expense for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $1,963,328, a decrease of $386,230, or 24%, from $1,577,098 for the prior year ended September 30, 2021 Other Income (Expenses) Other expense was $2,224,472 for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared with other income of $3,669,015 for the year ended September 30, 2021, which is a variance of $5,893,487. Other expense for the year ended September 30, 2022 consisted primarily of an unrealized loss on derivative security of $1,949,770 as compared to gain for the same prior year period of $2,790,387. This change between the periods is the result of a change in fair value of the underlying instrument. Interest expense in the current fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 also increased by $932,099 to $1,077,827 from $145,728 in the prior year comparable period. This increase was due to the Company increasing the amount of long-term debt during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 Net Loss from Continuing Operations Net loss from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $40,089,393 as compared to net loss of $8,229,162 for the year ended September 30, 2021. Results of Discontinued Operations Revenues from our former energy segment, which is now classified as discontinued operations remained fairly consistent for fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 from fiscal 2021, $9,667,290 and $10,151,010 respectively. The total costs and expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022 increased to $26,900,776 from $23,725,506 for the year ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to impairment expenses related to the energy business and severance related payroll expenses. As a result, the net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2022 increased to $17,236,961 from $13,582,848 in the prior year ended September 30, 2021. The Company expects that most costs related to discontinued operations have been incurred as of the period ended September 30, 2022 and future period costs will significantly decline in subsequent periods. Net Loss Net loss for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $57,326,354, in increase of $35,514,344 compared to net loss of $21,812,010 for the year ended September 30, 2021. Non-GAAP Measure We present adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, CleanSpark management believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure that exclude non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) impacts of interest, taxes, and depreciation; (ii) significant non-cash expenses such as our share-based compensation expense, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items that we believe are not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) significant impairment losses related to long-lived and digital assets, which include our bitcoin for which the accounting requires significant estimates and judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly 39 in comparison to other companies; and (iv) and impacts related to discontinued operations that would not be applicable to our future business activities. The Company's adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. The Company's adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Our management does not consider adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. We are providing non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”) that excludes the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, our share-based compensation expense, and impairment of assets, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items, certain non-recurring expenses, and impacts related to discontinued operations; Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure and is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and, as a result, this supplemental financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure internally to help understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and to help make operating decisions. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from the adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, and directors. We have also excluded impairment losses on assets, including impairments of our bitcoin from adjusted EBITDA, which may continue to occur in future periods as a result of our continued holdings of significant amounts of bitcoin. Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We rely primarily on such Consolidated Financial Statements to understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and use adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. 40 The following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of (i) interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization; (ii) our share-based compensation expense; (iii) impairment expense; (iv) unrealized gains/losses on securities; and (v) impacts related to discontinued operations, to its most directly comparable GAAP measure (i.e., net loss) for the periods indicated: Years Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA Net loss $ (57,326,354 ) $ (21,812,010 ) Loss on discontinued operations 17,236,961 13,582,848 Other impairment loss (related to bitcoin) 12,210,269 6,608,076 Impairment expense - other 250,000 - Impairment expense - goodwill 12,048,419 - Depreciation and amortization 49,044,877 8,982,123 Share-based compensation expense 31,464,994 8,546,712 Other income (308,036 ) (544,777 ) Change in fair value of contingent consideration (305,731 ) (84,198 ) Realized gain on sale of bitcoin (2,567,101 ) (3,104,378 ) Realized gain on sale of equity security (665 ) (179,046 ) Unrealized loss of equity security 1,847 5,153 Unrealized loss (gain) of derivative security 1,949,770 (2,790,387 ) Interest income (190,540 ) (221,488 ) Interest expense 1,077,827 145,728 Gain on disposal of assets (642,691 ) - Legal fees related to litigation 522,338 2,577,555 Legal fees related to financing & business development transactions 827,136 46,760 Severance expenses 404,749 PPP debt forgiveness — $ (531,169 ) Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA $ 65,698,069 $ 11,227,502 The following is a reconciliation of fair market value of our bitcoin holdings to the current carrying value at September 30, 2022 and 2021: September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Carrying Value (1) Fair Market Value (2) Carrying Value (1) Fair Market Value (2) Number of Bitcoins held 595 595 627 627 Value per coin (1) (2) $ 18,735 $ 19,403 $ 37,645 $ 43,929 Total $ 11,147,478 $ 11,544,785 $ 23,603,415 $ 27,543,483 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, inventory management, capital expenditures, public company costs and general corporate needs. We expect these needs to continue as we further develop and grow our business. For the year ended September 30, 2022, our primary sources of liquidity came from existing cash and cash equivalents, and bitcoin. Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and bitcoin, together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements until we reach profitability, and we are not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in a decrease in liquidity of our assets. We are likely to require additional capital to respond to technological advancements, competitive dynamics or technologies, business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and in either the short-term or long-term may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. If we are unable to 41 obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In particular, rising inflation and interest rates, and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption and volatility in the global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital. If we are unable to raise additional funds when or on the terms desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. As of September 30, 2022, we had total current assets of $50,775,974, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, bitcoin, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and other current assets, investment in debt security and related derivative asset, current assets held for sale, and total assets in the amount of $452,624,772. Our total current liabilities and total liabilities as of September 30, 2022 were $34,040,775 and $48,612,961, respectively. We had a working capital of $16,735,199 as of September 30, 2022. In addition, we have access to equity financing through our At-the-Market (""ATM"") offering facility and debt financing through the lending arrangement we entered into in April 2022. Material Cash Requirements We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022, while others are considered future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to purchase goods or services, primarily miners and equipment, entered into in the normal course of business and operating leases. The Company also has contractual obligations outside the normal course of business related to acquisitions deemed to be business combinations. For information regarding our contractual obligations, see Contractual Obligations below and refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies included elsewhere in this Annual Report. For information regarding our contractual obligations related to acquisitions deemed to be business combinations, refer to Note 4 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Operating Activities from Continuing Operations Operating activities provided $77,806,160 in cash for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to cash outflows of $12,159,108 for the same period ended September 30, 2021. Our sale of bitcoin of $133,201,006, depreciation and amortization of $49,044,877, stock-based compensation of $31,464,994, and impairment of bitcoin of $12,210,269 were the main components of our operating cash flow for year ended September 30, 2022, offset primarily by the increase in bitcoin mining of $130,999,686, net loss of $57,326,354, and increase in prepaid and other current assets of $2,393,320. Our use of net cash in operating activities during the year ended September 30, 2021 were primarily driven by net loss from continuing operations for the period of $8,229,162, bitcoin mining of $38,846,633, and unrealized gain on derivative asset of $2,790,387, offset by stock based compensation of $8,546,712, depreciation and amortization of $9,336,941, impairment of bitcoin of $6,608,076, sale of bitcoin of $11,443,132, and increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4,246,445. Cash provided by operating activities increased significantly primarily due to increased sales of bitcoin. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company mined significantly more bitcoin than the prior year, resulting in greater cash proceeds generated. Investing Activities from Continuing Operations Cash flows used by investing activities during the year ended September 30, 2022 was $210,981,538 as compared with $228,157,922 for the year ended September 30, 2021. Our payments on miner equipment purchase and deposits of $171,181,268, purchase of fixed assets of $19,285,904, and sale of miners of $3,497,654 were the main components of our investing cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2022. Our purchase of fixed assets of $139,234,948, and deposits on mining equipment of $89,260,010 were the main components of our negative investing cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2021. The negative cash flow from 42 investing activities was offset by acquisition of ATL Data Center, net of cash received of $45,783 and sale of equity securities of $373,121. Financing Activities from Continuing Operations Cash flows generated by financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2022 amounted to $141,959,688, as compared with $268,058,393 for the year ended September 30, 2021. Our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 consisted primarily of proceeds from underwritten offering of $125,047,987 and proceeds from equipment backed loan of $19,620,356. Our cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 consisted of $270,656,118 in proceeds from offerings, $3,750,932 in proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options offset by repayments of $5,882,553 on promissory notes and $288,602 in finance leases. In June 2021, we implemented an at-the-market share offering program (“ATM Offering”), whereby we may offer and sell our shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500 million. During our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, under this program, we sold 17,722,026 shares at a weighted average price of $7.06 per share, generating net proceeds of $125,047,987. The proceeds were used primarily to make acquisitions of capital equipment, including but not limited to bitcoin mining equipment, electrical infrastructure and acquisitions deemed business combinations. Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations The Company experienced significant cash outflows from its energy segment, which is a significant reason the Company concluded to exit the energy business segment. The cash used in the operating activities of the energy segment (discontinued operations) for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $6,362,067, as compared to cash used of $11,827,102 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The Company anticipates that the sale of its energy business will improve the future total cash provided by operating activities, and will improve liquidity to fund future growth initiatives in the bitcoin mining segment. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. This new guidance is effective for the Company for its fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is evaluating its potential impact but does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on October 1, 2020 (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model that reflects expected credit losses, including credit losses related to trade receivables, and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates, which generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. As the Company was a Smaller Reporting Company at the time of issuance of the ASU, the Company expects to adopt the ASU effective October 1, 2023, including the interim periods within the fiscal year. Early application of the adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating its potential impact but does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),” which reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments will be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net income 43 per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. The treasury stock method should no longer be used to calculate diluted net income per share for convertible instruments. The amendment will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We expect the adoption of ASU 2020-06 to not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures. The Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in the footnotes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 however we consider our critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition, long-lived assets, fair value of financial instruments, bitcoin, and stock-based compensation. Our significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company’s goodwill impairments and estimations of recoverability for long-lived assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not required for smaller reporting companies. 44 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Index to Financial Statements Required by Article 8 of Regulation S-X: Audited Consolidated Financial Statements: F- 1 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 206 ) F- 3 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021; F- 4 Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021; F- 5 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 F- 7 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021; F- 9 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 45 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of CleanSpark, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CleanSpark, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Evaluation of the Accounting for and Disclosure of Bitcoin Mining Revenue Recognized As disclosed in Note 2, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company provides computing power to the mining pools and in exchange for providing such computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the pool operator receives for successfully adding a block to the blockchain, plus a fractional share of the transaction fees attached to that block. The Company’s fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized net bitcoin mining revenue of approximately $131.0 million. We identified the accounting for and disclosure of bitcoin mining revenue recognized F- 1 as a critical audit matter because, currently, no specific definitive guidance exists for the accounting for and disclosure of bitcoin mining revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s management has exercised significant judgment in their determination of how existing GAAP should be applied to the accounting for and disclosure of bitcoin mining revenue recognized. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: · Performed a site visitation of the facilities where the Company’s mining hardware is located. The visitation included an observation of the physical and environmental controls and mining equipment inventory observation procedures; · Evaluated management’s rationale for the application of ASC 606 to account for bitcoin awards earned; · Evaluated management’s disclosures of its bitcoin activities in the financial statement footnotes; · Evaluated and tested management’s rationale and supporting documentation associated with the valuation of bitcoin awards earned; · Independently confirmed certain financial data and wallet records directly with the mining pool; · Compared the Company’s wallet records of bitcoin mining revenue received to publicly available blockchain records; and · Undertook an analytical review of total bitcoin mining revenue expected to be recognized by the Company by assessing the total hash power contributed onto the network by the Company against total block rewards and transaction fees issued over the year. Evaluation of the Accounting for and Disclosure of Bitcoin Held As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, bitcoin held by the Company as of September 30, 2022, are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and have been included in current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s bitcoin as of September 30, 2022 amounted to approximately $11.1 million. We identified the accounting for and disclosure of bitcoin held as a critical audit matter because, currently, no specific definitive guidance exists for the accounting for and disclosure of bitcoin held in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company’s management has exercised significant judgment in their determination of how existing GAAP should be applied to the accounting for bitcoin held, the associated financial statement presentation and accompanying footnote disclosures. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: · Evaluated management’s rationale for the application of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350 to account for bitcoin held and examined management’s processes for determining the amount of impairment expense recognized; · Evaluated management’s rationale for the inclusion of bitcoin as a current asset on the consolidated balance sheets; · Independently and directly confirmed the balance and ownership of bitcoin that is in the custody of a third party; · Evaluated management’s disclosures of its bitcoin activities in the financial statement footnotes; and · Examined supporting sale and cash receipt evidence for bitcoin sales, including management’s processes for calculating any gains or losses on sales of its bitcoin. /s/ MaloneBailey, LLP www.malonebailey.com We have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.

F- 8 CLEANSPARK, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND LINE OF BUSINESS Organization The Company – CleanSpark, Inc. (“CleanSpark,” “we,” “our,” ""Company"") was incorporated in the state of Nevada on October 15, 1987 as SmartData Corporation. In October 2016, the Company changed its name to CleanSpark, Inc. CleanSpark, Inc. is a sustainable bitcoin mining company. The Company, through itself and its wholly owned subsidiaries, has operated in the bitcoin mining sector since December 2020. Lines of Business Bitcoin Mining Business Through CleanSpark, Inc., and the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, ATL Data Centers LLC (“ATL”), CleanBlok, Inc. (“CleanBlok”), CleanSpark DW, LLC, and CleanSpark GLP, LLC, the Company mines bitcoin. The Company entered the bitcoin mining industry through its acquisition of ATL in December 2020. It acquired a second data center in August 2021 and has had a co-location agreement with New York-based Coinmint, LLC in place since July 2021. Bitcoin mining has now become the Company’s principal revenue generating business activity. The Company currently intends to acquire additional facilities, equipment and infrastructure capacity to continue to expand our bitcoin mining operations. Through the Company’s subsidiaries CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, CSRE Property Management Company, LLC, CSRE Properties, LLC, CSRE Properties Washington, LLC and CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC the Company maintains real property holdings. Discontinued Operations As of June 30, 2022, the Company deemed its energy operations to be discontinued operations due to its strategic decision to strictly focus on its bitcoin mining operations and divest of the majority of its energy assets. Through our discontinued operations segment, we previously provided energy solutions through our wholly-owned subsidiaries CleanSpark, LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc., GridFabric, LLC, and Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. These solutions consisted of engineering, design and software solutions, custom hardware solutions, Open Automated Demand response (“OpenADR”), solar, energy storage for microgrid and distributed energy systems. The Company has since sold the majority of its software and intellectual property assets related to the Energy Segment, and is in the process of selling additional remaining inventory and assets. We still own patented gasification energy technologies and are not currently planning to sell or market these technologies. Our technology converts organic material into synthesis gas, which can be used as fuel for a variety of applications and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether). Other business activities Through ATL, the Company also provides traditional data center services to a small number of remaining customers, such as providing customers with rack space, power and equipment, and offers several cloud services including virtual services, virtual storage, and data backup services. The Company is in the process of offloading those customers. F- 9 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Liquidity The accompanying audited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and have been filed with the SEC on December 14, 2022 (“Form 10-K”). As shown in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $ 40,089,393 and $ 8,229,162 during the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. While the Company has experienced negative cash flows from investing activities due to its continued investments in capital expenditures in support of its bitcoin mining operations, it has generated positive cash flows from operating and financing activities in fiscal 2022. The Company has sufficient working capital to support its ongoing operations for the next twelve months. In addition, the Company has access to equity financing through its at-the-market (""ATM"") offering facility and debt financing through the lending arrangement the Company entered into in April 2022 (see Note 9 and Note 11). As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the Company had working capital of $ 16,735,199 and $ 47,663,299 , respectively. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CleanSpark, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, CleanSpark, LLC, CleanSpark II, LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems Inc., p2kLabs, Inc, GridFabric, LLC, ATL Data Centers LLC, CleanBlok, Inc., CSRE Properties, LLC, Solar Watt Solutions, Inc, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC and CSRE Property Management Company, LLC. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities. As of June 30, 2022, the Company deemed its energy operations to be discontinued operation due to its strategic shift to strictly focus on its bitcoin mining operations and divest of its energy assets. The disposal groups related to the energy operations are part of the following entities: CleanSpark, LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems Inc., GridFabric, LLC, and Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue in operation one year after the date these financial statements are issued and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The evaluation of going concern under the accounting guidance requires significant judgment which involves the Company to consider that it has historically incurred losses in recent years as it has prepared to grow its business through acquisition opportunities. The Company must also consider its current liquidity as well as future market and economic conditions that may be deemed outside the control of the Company as it relates to obtaining financing and generating future profits. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had $ 20,462,570 of available cash on-hand and Bitcoin with a fair market value of $ 11,147,478 . In determining whether there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, the Company may consider the effects of any mitigating plans for additional sources of financing. The Company identified additional financing sources it believes are currently available to fund its operations and drive future growth that include (i) the ability to access capital using the ATM equity offering program available to the Company whereby the Company may sell additional shares of its common stock (discussed in Note 11 – Stockholders’ Equity), and (ii) the ability to raise additional financing from other sources. (Refer to Note 11 for further details). Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company’s goodwill and bitcoin impairment, intangible assets acquired, F- 10 impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition from bitcoin mining, valuation of derivative assets and liabilities, available-for-sale investments, allowances for uncollectible accounts, valuation of bitcoin, valuation of contingent consideration, warranty, and the valuations of share based awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the Financial Accounting Standard Board's (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, which requires that five steps be followed in evaluating revenue recognition: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identity the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfied a performance obligation. Our accounting policy on revenue recognition for our bitcoin mining segment (sole reporting unit as of September 2022) by type of revenue is provided below. Revenues from bitcoin mining The Company has entered into contracts with digital asset mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining pools. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and the Company’s enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company starts providing computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives (less net digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain, plus a fractional share of the transaction fees attached to that blockchain. The Company’s fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm. The transaction consideration the Company receives is noncash consideration, in the form of bitcoin, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or time the Company has earned the award from the mining pools. Fair value of the bitcoin award received is determined using the spot price of the related bitcoin on the date earned. There is currently no definitive guidance under GAAP or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for bitcoin recognized as revenue or held, and management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the FASB, the Company may be required to change its policies, which could have an effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results from operations. The total revenue recognized from bitcoin mining for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 is $ 130,999,686 and $ 38,846,633 , respectively. Revenues from data center services The Company provides data services such as providing its customers with rack space, power and equipment, and cloud services such as virtual services, virtual storage, and data backup services, generally based on monthly services provided at a defined price included in the contracts. The performance obligations are the services provided to a customer for the month based on the contract. The transaction price is the price agreed with the customer for the monthly services provided and the revenues are recognized monthly based on the services rendered for the month. The total revenue recognized from data center services for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 is $ 524,759 and $ 440,472 , respectively. Cost of Revenues Bitcoin mining segment (sole reportable segment) F- 11 The Company includes energy costs and external co-location mining hosting fees in cost of revenues. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks and restricted cash. The Company’s restricted cash represents amounts held in trust for certain construction projects. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported in the consolidated balance sheets that agrees to the total of those amounts as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows. September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash $ 20,462,570 $ 14,571,198 Restricted cash - construction escrow account — 3,469,129 Cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ 20,462,570 $ 18,040,327 Accounts receivable Accounts receivable is comprised of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms. They are initially recorded at the invoiced amount upon the sale of goods or services to customers, and do not bear interest. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and management closely monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reviewed periodically for collectability. If management determines that collection is unlikely, an allowance that reflects management’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected is recorded. Accounts receivable, net consists of the following: September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Accounts Receivable, gross $ 246,839 $ 307,067 Provision for doubtful allowances ( 219,810 ) — Total Accounts Receivable, net $ 27,029 $ 307,067 Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being measured on a first-in, first-out basis. For solar panel and battery installations, the Company transfers component parts from inventories to cost of goods sold once installation is complete. The Company periodically reviews inventories for unusable and obsolete items based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Based on this evaluation, provisions are made to write inventories down to their net realizable value. There were no write-downs of inventory as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. Prepaid expense and other current assets The Company records a prepaid expense for costs paid but not yet incurred. Those expected to be incurred within one year are recognized and shown as a short-term pre-paid expense. Any costs expected to be incurred outside of one year would be considered other long term assets. Other current assets are assets that consist of supplies, deposits, and interest receivable. Deposits and interest we expect to receive within one year are shown as short-term. Those we expect to receive outside of one year are shown as other long-term assets. Investment securities F- 12 Investment securities include debt securities and equity securities. Debt securities are classified as available for sale (“AFS”) and are reported as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their estimated fair value. As the fair values of AFS debt securities change, the changes are reported net of income tax as an element of OCI, except for other-than-temporarily-impaired securities. When AFS debt securities are sold, the unrealized gains or losses are reclassified from OCI to non-interest income. Securities classified as AFS are securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sell a security classified as AFS would be based on various factors, including significant movements in interest rates, changes in the maturity mix of the Company’s assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, decline in credit quality, and regulatory capital considerations. Interest income is recognized based on the coupon rate and increased by accretion of discounts earned or decreased by the amortization of premiums paid over the contractual life of the security. For individual debt securities where the Company either intends to sell the security or more likely than not will not recover all of its amortized cost, OTTI (other than temporary impairment) is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. For individual debt securities for which a credit loss has been recognized in earnings, interest accruals and amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts are suspended when the credit loss is recognized. Interest received after accruals have been suspended is recognized in income on a cash basis. The Company holds investments in both publicly held and privately held equity securities. However, as described in Note 1, the Company is primarily doing business of in the bitcoin mining sector, and not in the business of investing in securities. Privately held equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment. All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized or unrealized, are recorded through gains or losses on equity securities on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Publicly held equity securities are based on fair value accounting with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as unrealized gains or losses on equity securities in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Concentration Risk At times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of FDIC limits. The cash balance, in excess of the FDIC limits was $ 20,212,570 and $ 17,790,327 for periods ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The accounts offered by custodians of the Company’s bitcoin are not insured by the FDIC. The fair market value of bitcoin held in accounts covered by FDIC limits was $ 11,147,478 and $ 23,603,210 for the periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in these accounts. The Company has certain customers and vendors who individually represented 10% or more of the Company’s revenue or capital expenditures. In fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 , revenue is concentrated with one mining pool operator and all bitcoin reside in one exchange. Refer to Note 16 - Major Customers and Vendors. Leases In accordance with ASC 842, the Company assesses whether an arrangement contains a lease at contract inception. When an arrangement contains a lease, the Company categorizes leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in “Fixed Assets, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases. F- 13 The Company records right-of use (""ROU"") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments. Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Some leases include multiple year renewal options. The Company’s decision to exercise these renewal options is based on an assessment of its current business needs and market factors at the time of the renewal. Currently, the Company has no leases for which the option to renew is reasonably certain and therefore, options to renew were not factored into the calculation of its right of use asset and lease liability as of September 30, 2022. For all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. Stock -based compensation The Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10 Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company may issue compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management, accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services. The Company determines the grant date fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For equity awards granted by the Company that are contingent upon market-based conditions, the Company fair values these awards using the Monte Carlo simulation model. For discussion of accounting for restricted stock units (""RSUs""), please refer Note 13 – Stock-Based Compensation. Loss per share The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10 “Earnings Per Share,” which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021 , there were 7,069,706 and 2,173,578 , respectively, units of common stock equivalents that consist of options, warrants, and restricted stock units, as well as 5,250,000 shares issuable upon preferred stock conversions, that were excluded from the current and prior period diluted (loss) per share calculation as their effect is anti-dilutive. Provided below is the loss per share calculation for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021: F- 14 For the Year Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Continuing Operations Numerator Income (loss) from continuing operations $ ( 40,089,393 ) $ ( 8,229,162 ) Preferred stock dividends 335,439 177,502 Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders $ ( 40,424,832 ) $ ( 8,406,664 ) Denominator Weighted- average common shares outstanding, basic 42,614,197 29,441,364 Dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards — — Weighted- average common shares outstanding, diluted 42,614,197 29,441,364 Income (loss) from continuing operations per common share attributable to common shareholders Basic $ ( 0.95 ) $ ( 0.29 ) Diluted $ ( 0.95 ) $ ( 0.29 ) Discontinued Operations Numerator Loss on discontinued operations $ ( 17,236,961 ) $ ( 13,582,848 ) Denominator Weighted- average common shares outstanding, basic 42,614,197 29,441,364 Dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards — — Weighted- average common shares outstanding, diluted 42,614,197 29,441,364 Loss on discontinued operations per common share attributable to common shareholders Basic $ ( 0.40 ) $ ( 0.46 ) Diluted $ ( 0.40 ) $ ( 0.46 ) Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Construction in progress is the construction or development of assets that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use. Depreciation for machinery and equipment, mining equipment, buildings, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for its intended use. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Useful life (years) Land Improvements 15 Building 30 Leasehold improvements ﻿ Shorter of lease term or 15 years Miners 3 - 5 Mining Equipment 3 - 15 Infrastructure asset Shorter of lease term or 5 years Machinery and equipment 1 - 10 Furniture and fixtures 3 - 7 F- 15 In accordance with the FASB ASC 360-10, ""Property, Plant and Equipment” the carrying value of property and equipment, and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 the Company did not record an impairment expense for assets within its continuing operations. However, in connection with property and equipment in our discontinued operations, an impairment expense in the approximate amount of $ 32,000 was recognized and included in loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Business combinations, Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, where the total purchase price is allocated to the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The difference between the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration transferred is initially recognized at fair value. Contingent consideration classified as a liability or an asset is remeasured to fair value each period until settlement, with changes recognized in profit or loss. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured. Acquisition-related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred. The Company reviews its indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In accordance with its policies, the Company performed an assessment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill for the year end September 30, 2022. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred the following impairment losses: September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Impairment of bitcoin $ 12,210,269 $ 6,608,076 Impairment of goodwill 12,048,419 — Total impairment loss $ 24,258,688 $ 6,608,076 2022 Goodwill Impairment analysis In completing the 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company elected to perform a quantitative assessment for our goodwill. The assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the entity, including goodwill, to its estimated fair value. In accordance with ASU 2017-04, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. In determining the fair value for which the quantitative assessment was performed, the Company engaged a valuation specialist to perform the quantitative impairment analysis. The valuation report included a combination of the market and income approach to test for goodwill impairment. The income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. Using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, revenue is projected and applied to fixed and variable cost experience rates to arrive at the future cash flows. A terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream. Future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. The discount rate used was the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. In determining the estimated fair value, several factors were estimated, including projected operating results, growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows and the discount rate. The market valuation approach evaluated the company's market value as compared to the net asset balance. The assessment indicated that impairment of goodwill was necessary. Based on the assessment for impairment, the Company recognized an impairment expense of goodwill of $ 12,048,419 for the year ended September 30, 2022. F- 16 In completing the 2021 annual goodwill impairment analysis, there were no impairments recognized. The following table reflects goodwill activity for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively: Total Goodwill- September 30, 2020 $ — New Acquisitions 12,048,419 Impairment — Goodwill- September 30, 2021 12,048,419 New Acquisitions — Impairment ( 12,048,419 ) Goodwill- September 30, 2022 $ — The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives, which range between two and twenty years as follows: Useful life (years) Websites 3 Software 4 - 7 Strategic contract 5 Bitcoin Bitcoin are included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Bitcoin is recorded at cost less impairment. They are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other, and are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition policy detailed above and in Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. Quantitative impairment is measured using the quoted price of the bitcoin at the time its fair value is being measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. Quoted prices are obtained from the principal market. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted as per ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. Bitcoin earned by the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The sales of bitcoin are also included within operating activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and any realized gains or losses from such sales are included in operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first in first out (“FIFO”) method of accounting. The following table presents the activities of the bitcoin for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021: F- 17 Amount Balance as on September 30, 2020 $ — Addition of bitcoin 38,846,633 Sale of bitcoin ( 11,443,132 ) Bitcoin issued for services ( 296,593 ) Realized gain on sale of bitcoin 3,104,378 Impairment loss ( 6,608,076 ) Balance as on September 30, 2021 $ 23,603,210 Addition of bitcoin 130,999,686 Sale of bitcoin ( 133,201,006 ) Bitcoin issued for services ( 611,244 ) Realized gain on sale of bitcoin 2,567,101 Impairment loss ( 12,210,269 ) Balance as on September 30, 2022 $ 11,147,478 Fair Value Measurement of financial instruments, derivative asset and contingent consideration Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable. Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices included for identical or similar assets and liabilities that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. These are typically obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments. Level 3 Unobservable inputs, where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect the reporting entity’s own beliefs about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available in the circumstances. The carrying value of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term portion of loan payable approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company's long-term portion of loan payable is also stated at fair value since the stated rate of interest approximates market rates. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The following table presents the Company’s financial instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets on a recurring basis, and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021: September 30, 2022: Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Derivative asset $ 2,955,890 $ — $ — $ 2,955,890 Investment in debt security 610,108 — — 610,108 Total $ 3,565,998 $ — $ — $ 3,565,998 September 30, 2021: F- 18 Amount Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Derivative asset $ 4,905,660 $ — $ — $ 4,905,660 Investment in equity security 10,772 10,772 — — Investment in debt security 494,608 — — 494,608 Contingent cash consideration 820,802 — — 820,802 Total $ 6,231,842 $ 10,772 $ — $ 6,221,070 There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 or 3 during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The activities of the financial instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on the Company's balance sheets on a recurring basis during years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are included in Note 5 - Investments. Income taxes The Company’s calculation of its tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. The Company recognizes tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on management’s estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes will be required. The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. Deferred income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Temporary differences arise from net operating losses, differences in depreciation methods of archived images, and property and equipment, stock-based and other compensation, and other accrued expenses. A valuation allowance is established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S., or the various state jurisdictions, may be materially different from managements estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. Interest and penalties are included in tax expense. The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the provision for income taxes. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Income tax expense/(benefit) from operations for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $ 0 and $ 0 in each period, which resulted primarily from maintaining a full valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets. Segment Reporting The Company determines its operating segments based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (""CODM"") views and evaluates operations, performance and allocates resources. As of June 30, 2022, the Company only has the bitcoin mining business as its operating segment due to its determination to consider the energy business as discontinued operation based on its decision to make a strategic shift to focus on the bitcoin mining business and divest of its energy assets. Discontinued Operations The Company deems it appropriate to classify a business as a discontinued operation if the related disposal group meets all the following criteria: 1) The disposal group is a component of the Company; 2) The component meets the held-for-sale criteria; and 3) The disposal of the component represents a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. As of June 30, 2022, the Company deemed its energy operations to be F- 19 discontinued operation due to its strategic shift to strictly focus on its bitcoin mining operations and divest of its energy assets . Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. In June 2022, the Company made a strategic shift to focus on the bitcoin mining business and divest its energy assets. As a result, assets and liabilities related to the energy segment have been classified as held for sale for all periods presented. Additionally, amounts previously presented as part of continuing operations have been reclassified into discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, the following reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations or net assets of the Company and are as follows: Commitments and contingencies The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies and loss recoveries, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business. The Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as the Company’s ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available with its external and internal counsel to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed. Recently issued accounting pronouncements In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. This new guidance is effective for the Company for its fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is evaluating its potential impact but does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on October 1, 2020 (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model that reflects expected credit losses, including credit losses related to trade receivables, and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates, which generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. As the Company was a Smaller Reporting Company at the time of issuance of the ASU, the Company expects to adopt the ASU effective October 1, 2023, including the interim periods within the fiscal year. Early application of the adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating its potential impact but does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),” which reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments will be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net income F- 20 per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. The treasury stock method should no longer be used to calculate diluted net income per share for convertible instruments. The amendment will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We expect the adoption of ASU 2020-06 to not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures. 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS The Company determined to make available for sale the asset groups related to the energy segment due to its strategic shift to strictly focus on its bitcoin mining operations. As a result, the Energy segments' results of operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all periods presented. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of this segment are separately reported as “assets and liabilities held for sale” as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 in the consolidated balance sheets. The results of operations of this segment, for all periods, are separately reported as “discontinued operations” in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss . Provided below are the key areas of the financials that constitute the discontinued operations: September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 ASSETS Current assets Accounts receivable, net $ 2,813,166 $ 2,312,890 Inventory 4,399,915 2,592,933 Prepaid expense and other current assets 212,800 2,991,243 Total current assets held for sale $ 7,425,881 $ 7,897,066 Property and equipment, net 11,284 53,193 Operating lease right of use asset 665,071 824,435 Intangible assets, net 868,319 4,476,306 Goodwill — 7,000,779 Long-term assets held for sale $ 1,544,674 $ 12,354,713 Total assets held for sale $ 8,970,555 $ 20,251,779 LIABILITIES Current liabilities Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 918,758 $ 1,289,713 Contract liabilities 116,690 — Operating lease liability 163,248 152,064 Total current liabilities held for sale 1,198,696 1,441,777 Long-term liabilities Operating lease liability, net of current portion 511,530 674,779 Total liabilities held for sale $ 1,710,226 $ 2,116,556 F- 21 For the year ended September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Revenues, net Energy hardware, software and services revenue $ 9,667,290 $ 10,151,010 Total revenues, net 9,667,290 10,151,010 Costs and expenses Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below) 8,710,760 8,701,681 Professional fees 115,960 486,583 Payroll expenses 4,911,322 4,173,778 General and administrative expenses 1,640,920 823,508 Impairment expense - fixed assets 31,833 — Impairment expense - intangibles 1,402,016 1,531,711 Impairment expense - other 871,649 — Impairment expense - goodwill 7,000,779 4,746,000 Depreciation and amortization 2,215,537 3,262,245 Total costs and expenses 26,900,776 23,725,506 Loss from operations ( 17,233,486 ) ( 13,574,496 ) Other income (expense) Interest expense ( 3,475 ) ( 8,352 ) Total other income (expense) ( 3,475 ) ( 8,352 ) Loss before income tax (expense) or benefit ( 17,236,961 ) ( 13,582,848 ) Income tax (expense) or benefit — — Net loss $ ( 17,236,961 ) $ ( 13,582,848 ) 4. ACQUISITIONS Acquisitions Relating to Continuing Operations SPRE COMMERCIAL GROUP, INC. AND WAHA TECHNOLOGIES, INC. On August 17, 2022, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, CSRE Properties Washington, LLC, (“CSRE”), completed the purchase of real property, together with all improvements situated thereon and all rights, easements and appurtenances belonging thereto (collectively, the “Property”), from SPRE Commercial Group, Inc. f/k/a WAHA, Inc. (“SPRE”), (the “Seller”), pursuant to a Land Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of August 5, 2022 and amended on August 17, 2022. Additionally, on August 17, 2022, in connection with the Land Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Company completed the purchase of a mix of S19 and S19 J Pro bitcoin miners with a total processing power equal to approximately 341,985 terahashes, pursuant to an equipment purchase and sale agreement (together with the Land Purchase and Sale Agreement, the “Acquisition”), from Waha Technologies, Inc., a Georgia corporation (“WAHA”, collectively with the Seller ""WAHA & SPRE"" or the ""Sellers""), an affiliate of the Seller. Pursuant to the Land Purchase and Sale Agreement and the Equipment Purchase and Sale Agreement the Company acquired substantially all of WAHA & SPRE's assets. The transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of a business. Total consideration for the Property and miners consisted of (i) $1,961,747 in financing provided by the Seller to the Company at an interest rate of 12% per annum, to be repaid in 12 monthly installments of $173,651, (ii) the Company’s assumption of a mortgage with a maximum principal amount of $2,158,253 and an interest rate of 13% and (iii) $19,771,610 of cash consideration paid by the Company to the Seller. Acquisition related costs of $118,058, consisting primarily of legal and recording fees, were expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 805 and are reflected in professional fees on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. F- 22 The Company determined the fair value of the consideration given to the Sellers in connection with the transaction and the allocation of the purchase price in accordance with ASC 820 were as follows: Consideration: Fair Value Cash $ 19,771,610 Financing provided by Seller 1,961,747 Mortgage assumed 2,158,253 Total Consideration $ 23,891,610 Purchase Price Allocation Preliminary Allocation at Acquisition Date Land $ 100,000 Building/Improvements 14,700,000 Miners 9,091,610 Total $ 23,891,610 The total purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets deemed acquired based on their estimated fair values. The fair values of the assets have been recorded and are reflected in property and equipment, net on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in this annual report. The useful life for the building and improvements is estimated to be 30 years consistent with the Company's policy. The useful life for miners was estimated to be 3 years consistent with the Company's policy for depreciating used miners. Land is not depreciated. Financing provided by the Seller and the mortgage assumed have been recorded as loans payable and are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. ATL DATA CENTERS, LLC On December 9, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “ATL Merger”) with ATL Data Centers LLC (“ATL”) and its members. The Company accounted for the acquisition of ATL as an acquisition of a business under ASC 805 – Business Combination. At the closing, ATL became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In exchange, the Company issued 1,618,285 shares of restricted common stock to the selling members of ATL, of which: (i) 642,309 shares were fully earned on closing, and (ii) an additional 975,976 shares were issued and held in escrow, subject to holdback pending satisfaction of certain indemnification claims and future milestones, with all such shares subject to a lock up of no less than 180 days and a leak out of no more than 10% of the average daily trading value of the prior 30 days . The Company determined the fair value of the consideration given to the sellers of ATL in connection with the transaction in accordance with ASC 820 was as follows: Consideration Preliminary Allocation at Acquisition Date Adjustments to Fair Value Final Allocation at Acquisition Date 642,309 shares of common stock $ 8,407,826 — $ 8,407,826 975,976 shares of common stock – held in escrow 12,775,525 — 12,775,525 Total Consideration $ 21,183,351 — $ 21,183,351 Of the 975,976 shares held in escrow, 515,724 shares were released to the selling members of ATL and 68,194 shares were returned to the Company and canceled due to nonsatisfaction of certain indemnification claims during the year ended September 30, 2021. The remaining 392,058 shares held in escrow consist of 72,989 shares subject to holdback pending satisfaction of further indemnification claims and 319,069 shares subject to satisfaction of future milestones. F- 23 In connection with the return of the 68,194 shares held in escrow that were cancelled due to the non-satisfaction of certain indemnification claims, total consideration and the related goodwill, decreased by $ 892,659 during the year ended September 30, 2021. The consideration remitted in connection with the ATL Merger is subject to adjustment based on post-closing adjustments to closing cash, indebtedness, and transaction expenses of ATL within 90 days of closing. The Company also assumed approximately $ 6.9 million in debts of ATL at closing. As part of the transaction costs, the Company issued 41,708 shares of common stock for an aggregate value of $ 545,916 to the broker which were expensed upon issuance of the shares. Purchase Price Allocation Preliminary Allocation at Acquisition Date Adjustments to Fair Value Final Allocation at Acquisition Date Strategic Contract $ 7,457,970 $ 2,342,000 $ 9,799,970 Goodwill 14,205,245 ( 1,264,167 ) 12,941,078 Other Assets and Liabilities assumed, net ( 479,864 ) ( 1,077,833 ) ( 1,557,697 ) Total $ 21,183,351 $ — $ 21,183,351 The Company made measurement period adjustments, primarily to strategic contract and goodwill, to better reflect the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition represents the strategic benefits of growing the Company’s service portfolio and the expected revenue growth from increased market penetration. Acquired goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The total purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets deemed acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. The strategic contract relates to supply of a critical input to our bitcoin mining business. The other assets and liabilities assumed include $ 5,670,000 of bitcoin mining equipment and approximately $ 5,475,000 of notes payable related to this equipment, which was settled by the Company in December 2020. In connection with the acquisition, the Company had acquired an operating lease related to a rental building, which had a purchase option associated with the lease agreement. The Company exercised the purchase option to buy the property in May 2021 and, as a result, terminated the lease. The amortization period for strategic contracts is estimated to be 5 years . The Company estimated the fair value of the identified strategic contract using a discounted cash flow model. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands over its remaining useful life, and discount rates the Company believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with strategic contract, which is 6.4 %. The Company believes the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. Net sales and net income of this business included in CleanSpark’s consolidated results of operations in fiscal year 2021 were approximately $ 30,234,683 and $ 14,449,160 , respectively. Acquisitions Relating to Discontinued Operations SOLAR WATT SOLUTIONS, INC. On February 23, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “SWS Merger Agreement”) with Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. (“SWS”) and its owners (the “Sellers”). The Company accounted for the acquisition of SWS as an acquisition of a business under ASC 805 – Business Combination. At the closing on February 24, 2021, SWS became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In exchange, the Company issued (i) 477,703 shares of restricted common stock with a deemed value of $ 15,640,000 calculated based on the five-day average closing price of the Company's common stock for the trading days including and immediately F- 24 preceding the closing date of $ 32.74 per share to the Sellers, of which (a) 167,685 shares with a deemed value of $ 5,490,000 would be fully earned on closing, and (b) an additional 310,018 shares with a deemed fair value of $ 10,150,000 were issued to an escrow agent and only earned by Sellers, subject to holdback pending Sellers’ satisfaction of certain future milestones with all such shares subject to a lock up of no less than 180 days and a leak out of no more than 10% of average daily trading value of the prior 30 days for a period of 36 months following the closing, and (ii) up to $3,850,000 in cash to the Sellers, minus the Sellers’ debt, minus the difference between the Actual Amount and Expected Amount consisting of: (a) $1,350,000 (no changes post acquisition date) in cash payable on a pro rata basis to Sellers at closing, less payment of $500,000 (no changes post acquisition date) to settle Sellers’ debt at closing, which includes (x) $200,000 (no changes post acquisition date) in cash held back by the Company to satisfy potential damages from indemnification claims and any amounts owed pursuant to post-closing adjustments, (y) an additional $100,000 (no changes post acquisition date) in cash held back by the Company to satisfy any amounts owed pursuant to post-closing adjustments, and (b) up to $2,500,000 (fair valued at $155,000 at acquisition date) in cash held back by the Company and only payable pro rata to Sellers upon meeting certain future milestones and subject to satisfaction of any amounts owing from SWS to the Company resulting from damages required to be indemnified under the SWS Merger Agreement. The Company determined the fair value of the consideration given to the sellers of SWS in connection with the transaction in accordance with ASC 820 was as follows: Consideration: Fair Value Cash $ 1,350,000 Contingent consideration 155,000 310,018 shares of common stock as contingent equity consideration 533,002 167,685 shares of common stock 4,649,905 Total Consideration $ 6,687,907 Preliminary Allocation at Acquisition Date Adjustments to Fair Value Final Allocation at Acquisition Date Customer List $ 5,122,733 $ ( 4,932,733 ) $ 190,000 Goodwill 1,642,409 5,178,126 6,820,535 Other Assets and Liabilities assumed, net ( 77,235 ) ( 245,393 ) ( 322,628 ) Total $ 6,687,907 $ — $ 6,687,907 The goodwill recorded as result of the acquisition represents the strategic benefits of growing the Company’s service portfolio and the expected revenue growth from increased market penetration. Acquired goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The total purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets deemed acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. The amortization period for customer list is estimated to be 1.5 years. The Company estimated the fair value of the identified customer list using a discounted cash flow model. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected incremental future cash flows over its remaining useful life, and discount rates the Company believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with customer list, which is 14 %. The Company believes the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. On January 31, 2022, the Company entered into a Merger Satisfaction and Release Agreement (the ""Merger Satisfaction Agreement"") with the Sellers of SWS. In consideration of fully satisfying the terms under the SWS Merger Agreement, the Company paid the Sellers $ 625,000 and released from escrow 77,500 shares of the Company's common stock. Additionally, the Sellers agreed to release back to the Company 232,518 shares of the Company's common stock held in escrow. Upon delivery of such consideration, the parties agreed that the shares and cash holdbacks contained in the original merger agreement were fully satisfied.

On November 5, 2019, the Company entered in a binding Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with International Land Alliance, Inc. (“ILAL”), a Wyoming corporation, to lay a foundational framework where the Company will deploy its energy solutions products and services to ILAL, its energy projects, and its customers. In connection with the MOU, and to support the power and energy needs of ILALs development and construction of certain projects, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”), dated as of November 6, 2019, with ILAL. Investment in Debt Securities (Preferred Stock) and related Embedded Derivative Asset Pursuant to the terms of the SPA with ILAL, the Company purchased 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of ILAL (the “Preferred Stock”) an aggregate purchase price of $ 500,000 (the “Stock Transaction”), less certain expenses and fees. The Series B Preferred Stock accrue cumulative in-kind accruals at a rate of 12% per annum and were redeemable on August 6, 2020. The Preferred Stock can be converted into common stock at a variable rate (refer the discussion on embedded derivative assets below). This variable conversion ratio will increase by 10% with the occurrence of certain events. Since the investments were not redeemed on August 6, 2020, they are now redeemable at the Company`s option in cash or into common stock, based on the conversion ratio. The Preferred Stock is recorded as an AFS debt security and is reported at its estimated fair value as of September 30, 2022 . Any change in the fair values of AFS debt securities are reported net of income tax as an element of Other Comprehensive income. The Company accrued interest (net of allowance) on our available-for-sale debt securities totaling $ 0 and $ 399,863 , as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, is included in prepaid expense and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

F- 26 The Company has deemed this variable conversion feature of ILAL preferred stock as an embedded derivative instrument in accordance with ASC Topic No. 815. This topic requires the Company to account for the conversion feature on its balance sheet at fair value and account for changes in fair value as a derivative gain or loss. Unrealized gain or loss on fair valuation of this embedded feature is recognized as an income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Total fair value of investment in Derivative assets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 is $ 2,955,890 and $ 4,905,660 . The Company fair values the debt security as a straight debt instrument based on liquidation value and accrued interest to date. The fair value of the derivative asset is based on the difference in the fair value of the debt security determined as a straight debt instrument and the fair value of the debt security if converted as of the reporting date. Commitment shares - Common stock of ILAL Pursuant to the terms of the SPA with ILAL, the Company received 350,000 shares (commitment shares) of ILALs common stock. The commitment shares were fully earned at the time of execution of the agreement.

INCOME TAXES The Company provides for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. FASB ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently. FASB ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the Company’s opinion, it is uncertain whether they will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset. Accordingly, a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been recorded. Due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 2017, we have calculated our deferred tax assets using an estimated corporate tax rate of 21 %. U.S. Tax codes and laws may be subject to further reform or adjustment which may have a material impact to the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 the Company's income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income taxes were as follows: September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Domestic $ ( 40,089,393 ) $ ( 8,229,162 ) Foreign - - Loss before income taxes $ ( 40,089,393 ) $ ( 8,229,162 ) The component of the provision for income taxes in the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows: September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Current: Federal $ - $ - State - - Deferred: Federal $ - $ - State - - Provision for income taxes $ - $ - Income tax benefit attributable to loss from continuing operations differed from the amounts computed by applying the statutory U.S federal income tax rate of 21 % to pretax loss from continuing operations as a result of the following: September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Tax Benefit at Federal statutory rate $ ( 8,417,258 ) $ ( 1,728,117 ) Tax Benefit at State rate ( 303,448 ) ( 62,300 ) Meals and Entertainment 30,339 114 Stock Based Compensation 2,060,702 - Non deductible Payroll expense - ( 231,134 ) ISO - Disqualifying Dispositions ( 58,493 ) Penalties - 375 True Ups 4,407,634 323,497 R&D Credits ( 200,000 ) ( 200,457 ) Discontinued Operations ( 3,750,257 ) ( 2,955,236 ) Other ( 1,569 ) ( 1,172 ) Change in Valuation Allowance 6,232,350 4,854,430 $ - $ - F- 38 The significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: September 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 Deferred Tax Assets: Right of Use - Lease Liability $ 268,771 $ - Charitable Contributions 7,034 507 Section 1231 Loss Carryforwards 1,183,440 2,995,030 Tax Credits 400,457 200,457 Stock Based Compensation 3,740,106 135,366 Interest Expense Carryforwards 193,804 - Net Operating Loss carryforwards 93,052,447 42,880,598 Gross Deferred Tax Assets $ 98,846,059 $ 46,211,958 Valuation Allowance ( 28,756,392 ) ( 22,524,043 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 70,089,667 $ 23,687,915 Deferred Tax Liabilities Right of Use - Lease Asset $ ( 264,566 ) $ - Prepaid Expenses ( 222,566 ) ( 187,790 ) Unrealized Gain on Derivative Asset ( 85,415 ) ( 857,243 ) Unrealized Gain on Equity Security ( 62,859 ) ( 63,261 ) Gain/Loss on Sale of Assets not on TR ( 25,732 ) ( 602 ) Fixed Assets & Intangible Assets ( 69,428,529 ) ( 22,579,019 ) Net Deferred Tax Assets $ - $ - For the year ended September 30, 2022, based on all available objective evidence, including the existence of cumulative losses, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets were fully realizable as of September 30, 2022. Accordingly, the Company established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had $ 417.8 million of federal and $ 91.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, of which federal net operating loss carryforwards of $ 358.6 million have an indefinite life. The federal net operating losses began to expire in 2007, while state net operating losses begin to expire in 2025. The Company's ability to utilize its federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credit carryforwards to reduce future taxable income and future taxes, respectively, may be subject to restrictions attributable to equity transactions that may have resulted in a change in ownership as defined by Internal Revenue Code (""IRC"") Section 382, for which the Company is in the process of completing a study. In the event that the Company has such a change in ownership, the Company's utilization of these carryforwards could be severely restricted and could result in the expiration of a significant amount of these carryforwards prior to the Company recognizing their benefit. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and state jurisdictions. The 2018-2021 tax years generally remain subject to examination by the IRS and various state taxing authorities, although the Company is not currently under examination in any jurisdiction. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted March 27, 2020. Among the business provisions, the CARES Act provided for various payroll tax incentives, changes to net operating loss carryback and carryforward rules, business interest expense limitation increases, and bonus depreciation on qualified improvement property. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 was signed on December 27, 2020 which provided additional COVID relief provisions for businesses. The Company has evaluated the impact of both the Acts and has determined that any impact is not material to its financial statements. 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES F- 39 Purchase of bitcoin mining equipment The Company has cancellable purchase commitments totaling approximately $ 27 million related to purchase of miners and approximately $ 1.5 million related to purchase of mining operations related equipment and construction projects as of September 30, 2022 , and the Company has paid approximately $ 3 million towards these commitments as of the end of this period. As of September 30, 2022 , the remaining commitment for future payments was approximately $ 28.5 million. Future hosting agreements On March 29, 2022, the Company entered into a Hosting Agreement (the ""Lancium Agreement"") with Lancium LLC (“Lancium”). Pursuant to the Lancium Agreement, Lancium has agreed to host, power and provide maintenance and other related services to the Company’s mining equipment to be placed at Lancium facilities. Pursuant to the Agreement, Lancium will provide 200 megawatts in support of Company’s mining equipment. In addition, for a period of two and a half years following the operations commencement date under the Agreement, the Company will have an option to increase the power capacity supplied to the Company up to 500 MW or 40% of the aggregate capacity of all facilities owned and operated by Lancium, whichever is lesser. As consideration for the Services, the Company shall pay Lancium a power charge fee based on kilowatt hours consumed by the Company’s equipment and a hosting fee based on power consumed, subject to service level adjustments and credits, if any. The Agreement further provides that through December 31, 2023, Lancium, subject to certain limited exceptions, will not enter into any all-in fixed price agreements with other customers with the same or less power draw as the Company that contains more favorable terms for the fixed all-in price than those in the Lancium Agreement, unless the Company is provided with the same lower fixed price under the Lancium Agreement. The Agreement has an initial term of five years from the operations commencement date (unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the Agreement), after which it will renew automatically for two-year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least ninety days prior to the expiration of the term or renewal term, as applicable. As of September 30, 2022, the Company did not have any contractual future payment obligations under the terms of the Agreement. Contractual future payments The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments towards our agreements as of September 30, 2022: 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Total Recorded contractual obligations: Operating lease obligations $ 135,368 $ 139,429 $ 143,612 $ 147,920 $ 50,659 $ 616,988 Finance Lease obligations 274,651 161,766 21,607 1,853 - 459,877 Mining equipment 27,000,000 - - - - 27,000,000 Mining operations related equipment 1,504,093 - - - - 1,504,093 Total $ 28,914,112 $ 301,195 $ 165,219 $ 149,773 $ 50,659 $ 29,580,958 Contingent Consideration GridFabric, LLC On August 31, 2020, the Company acquired GridFabric, LLC. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, additional shares of the Company’s common stock valued at up to $ 750,000 were issuable if GridFabric, LLC achieves certain revenue and product release milestones. On September 30, 2021, the contingent consideration was re-measured to $ 500,000 . On November 23, 2021, the Company settled all contingent consideration due to GridFabric, LLC resulting in a payment of 8,404 shares of common stock valued at $ 150,000 . Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. F- 40 On February 24, 2021, the Company acquired Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, additional cash consideration of up to $ 2,500,000 (fair valued at $ 155,000 at acquisition date) in cash held back by the Company and only payable pro rata to Sellers upon meeting certain future milestones and subject to satisfaction of any amounts owing from SWS to the Company resulting from damages required to be indemnified under the SWS Merger Agreement. The contingent cash consideration was re-measured to $ 615,249 at December 31, 2021. On January 31, 2022, the Company settled all contingent consideration due to the SWS sellers, resulting in a payment of $ 625,000 , 77,500 shares of common stock released out of escrow to the SWS sellers, and SWS sellers releasing 232,518 shares of common stock back the Company. Legal contingencies From time to time we may be subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. Based on the opinion of legal counsel and other factors, management believes that the final disposition of these existing matters will not have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Company. The Company has identified certain claims as a result of which a loss may be incurred, but in the aggregate the loss is expected to be insignificant. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may materially differ from our current estimates. For other claims regarding proceedings that are in an initial phase, the Company is unable to estimate the range of possible loss, if any, but at this time believes that any loss related to such claims will not be material. Risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify, and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. We maintain liability insurance to reduce such risk exposure to the Company. Despite the measures taken, such policies may not cover future litigation, or the damages claimed may exceed our coverage which could result in contingent liabilities.. Bishins v. CleanSpark, Inc. et al. On January 20, 2021, Scott Bishins (“Bishins”), individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (together, the “Class”), filed a class action complaint (the “Class Complaint”) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, Zachary Bradford (“Bradford”), and its Chief Financial Officer, Lori Love (“Love”) (such action, the “Class Action”). The Class Complaint alleged that, between December 31, 2020 and January 14, 2021, the Company, Bradford, and Love “failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the Company had overstated its customer and contract figures; (2) that several of the Company’s recent acquisitions involved undisclosed related party transactions; and (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.” The Class Complaint sought: (a) certification of the Class, (b) an award of compensatory damages to the Class, and (c) an award of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Class in the litigation. On December 2, 2021, the Court appointed Darshan Hasthantra as lead Plaintiff (together, with Bishins, the “Plaintiffs”), and Glancy, Prongay and Murray LLP as class counsel. Hasthantra filed an Amended Complaint on February 28, 2022 (the “Amended Class Complaint”). In the Amended Class Complaint, Love is no longer a defendant and S. Matthew Schultz (“Schultz”) has been added as a defendant (the Company, Bradford and Schultz, collectively, the “Defendants”). The Amended Class Complaint alleges that, between December 10, 2020 and August 16, 2021 (the “Class Period”), Defendants made material misstatements and omissions regarding the Company’s acquisition of ATL Data Centers, Inc. (“ATL”) and its anticipated expansion of bitcoin mining operations. In particular, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants: (1) were misleading in their various public announcements related to the timeline for expanding ATL’s mining capacity; and (2) failed to disclose other material conditions purportedly related to the Company’s acquisition of ATL, including that an ATL predecessor had filed for bankruptcy about six months prior to the acquisition, that another bitcoin miner had declined to acquire ATL, and that F- 41 a related party had performed an audit of ATL for the Company. The Amended Class Complaint seeks: (a) certification of the Class, (b) an award of compensatory damages to the Class, and (c) an award of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Class in the litigation. To date, no class has been certified in the Class Action. The Company filed its Motion to Dismiss on April 28, 2022. The Motion to Dismiss seeks dismissal of all claims asserted in the Amended Class Complaint with prejudice and without leave to amend on the grounds that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Plaintiffs filed their opposition on June 27, 2022. Defendants’ reply in further support of their Motion to Dismiss was filed on August 11, 2022. The parties are awaiting a decision or oral argument on the Motion to Dismiss. Although the ultimate outcome of the Class Action cannot be determined with certainty, the Company stands behind all of its prior statements and disclosures and believes that the claims raised in the Amended Class Complaint and the Class Complaint are entirely without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims. Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ allegations’ lack of merit, however, the Class Action may distract the Company and cost the Company’s management time, effort and expense to defend against the claims made in the Amended Class Complaint. Notwithstanding the Company’s belief that the Company and its management have complied with all of their obligations under applicable securities regulations, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the Class Action, and in the event the Company does not prevail in such action, the Company, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Ciceri, derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., v. Bradford, Love, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill, and Wood (consolidated with Perna, derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., v. Bradford, Love, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill, and Wood) On May 26, 2021, Andrea Ciceri (“Ciceri”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “Ciceri Derivative Action”) in the United States District Court in the District of Nevada against Chief Executive Officer, Zachary Bradford (“Bradford”), Chief Financial Officer, Lori Love (“Love”) and Directors Matthew Schultz, Roger Beynon, Larry McNeill and Tom Wood (Bradford, Love and Directors collectively referred to as “Ciceri Derivative Defendants.”) On June 22, 2021, Mark Perna (“Perna”) (Ciceri, Perna, and Ciceri Derivative Defendants collectively referred to as the “Parties”) filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “Perna Derivative Action”) in the same Court against the same Ciceri Derivative Defendants, making substantially similar allegations. On June 29, 2021, the Court consolidated the Ciceri Derivative Action with the Perna Derivative Action in accordance with a stipulation among the parties (the consolidated case referred to as the “Derivative Action”). The Derivative Action alleges that Ciceri Derivative Defendants: (1) made materially false and misleading public statements about the Company’s business and prospects; (2) did not maintain adequate internal controls; and (3) did not disclose several related party transactions benefitting insiders, questionable uses of corporate assets, and excessive compensation. The claims asserted against all Ciceri Derivative Defendants include breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. A claim for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities and Exchange Act is asserted against only Bradford and Love. The Derivative Action seeks declaratory relief, monetary damages, and imposition of adequate corporate governance and internal controls. Plaintiffs were given the opportunity to submit an Amended Complaint by November 25, 2021, but elected not to. In January 2022, the Parties agreed to stay the entirety of the case pending the outcome of the Motion to Dismiss in the Class Action. Any of the Parties may also terminate the stay on 20 days’ notice. Although the ultimate outcome of the Derivative Action cannot be determined with certainty, the Company stands behind all of its prior statements and disclosures, and believes that the claims raised in that case are entirely without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims. Notwithstanding the Derivative Action’s lack of merit, however, it may distract the Company and cost the Company’s management time, effort and expense to defend against the claims. Notwithstanding the Company’s belief that the F- 42 Company and its management have complied with all of their obligations under applicable securities regulations, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the Derivative Action, and in the event the Company does not prevail in such action, the Company, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Solar Watt Solutions, Inc., v. Pathion, Inc. On January 6, 2022 , Solar Watt Solutions, Inc., (“SWS”) filed suit in the Superior Court of the State of California in the County of Santa Clara against Pathion, Inc., (“Pathion”) for breach of contract, conversion, unjust enrichment and negligent misrepresentation. Prior to its acquisition by the Company, SWS paid Pathion $ 418,606 for solar batteries and related equipment for delivery in August 2019, later amended to November 2019. Pathion never delivered any of the items purchased by SWS. Pathion’s breach resulted in SWS being unable to complete a separate contract and cost the end-user client over $ 15,000 per month in electricity costs. SWS is seeking an award of compensatory damages totaling over $ 500,000 . Pathion filed an answer on or around February 16, 2022, generally denying the claims asserted by SWS. SWS served discovery on Pathion in May 2022; Pathion did not serve responses. Accordingly, SWS filed a Motion for Order Establishing Admissions and for Sanctions on July 25, 2022, and was awarded $ 1,750 in sanctions. The parties are currently engaged in discovery process. Darfon America Corp., etc. vs. CleanSpark, Inc., etc., et al. On August 18, 2022, Darfon America Corp filed a breach of contract suit in connection with a purchase contract for batteries. In short, Plaintiff contends that the Company ordered batteries and did not pay for them. Plaintiff is seeking $ 5.4 million in damages and additional co sts and fees. The Company contends, among other things, that the batteries did not meet the necessary specifications. This case is in a very early stage as discovery has only just commenced. The Company is confident in its legal position and does not anticipate a loss. 16.

F- 44 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report (under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”)). Based on that assessment, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures is expressed at a level of reasonable assurance because management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO and effected by our Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting include policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our Board and management; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Under the supervision and participation of our management, including our CEO, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this evaluation under the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022. This Annual Report does not include an attestation report by MaloneBailey, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Item 9B. Other Information None. 44 Item 9C.

Business As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” “CleanSpark, Inc.” and “CleanSpark” mean CleanSpark, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. Overview CleanSpark, Inc. is a leading bitcoin mining and diversified energy company incorporated in Nevada, whose common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market . We sustainably mine bitcoin; we also provide advanced energy technology solutions to commercial and residential customers to solve modern energy challenges. The Company, through itself and its wholly owned subsidiaries, has operated in the digital currency mining sector since December 2020, and in the alternative energy sector since March 2014. We are currently working with industry leaders and other advisors in developing a long-term sustainability and clean energy plan. We are also using all available clean and renewable energy resources that we currently have reasonable access to in all of our bitcoin mining locations in order to further support our sustainability efforts. Lines of Business Digital Currency Mining Segment Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, ATL Data Centers LLC (“ATL”) and CleanBlok, Inc. (“CleanBlok”) , we mine bitcoin. We entered the bitcoin mining industry through our acquisition of ATL in December 2020. We acquired a second data center in August 2021 and have had a co-location agreement with N ew York-based Coinmint in place since July 2021. Bitcoin mining has now become our principal revenue generating business activity. We currently intend to continue to acquire additional facilities, equipment and infrastructure capacity to continue to expand our bitcoin mining operations. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the goal of serving as a digital means of exchanging and storing value. Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that depends upon a consensus-based network and a public ledger called a “blockchain,” which contains a record of every bitcoin transaction ever processed. The bitcoin network is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network, powered by users participating in the consensus protocol, with no central authority or middlemen, that has wide network participation. The authenticity of each bitcoin transaction is protected through digital signatures that correspond with addresses of users that send and receive bitcoin. Users have full control over remitting bitcoin from their own sending addresses. All transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are transparent, allowing those running the appropriate software to confirm the validity of each transaction. To be recorded on the blockchain, each bitcoin transaction is validated through a proof-of-work consensus method, which entails solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and post them on the blockchain. This process is called mining. Miners are rewarded with bitcoins, both in the form of newly-created bitcoins and fees in bitcoin, for successfully solving the mathematical problems and providing computing power to the network. Factors such as access to computer processing capacity, interconnectivity, electricity cost, environmental factors (such as cooling capacity) and location play important roles in mining. As of the date of this filing, our mining units are currently capable of producing over 1.3 exahash/s (“EH”) in hash rate capacity. In cryptocurrency mining, “hash rate” is a measure of the processing capacity and speed by which a mining computer mines and processes transactions on the bitcoin network. Our activities in this area are complemented by our energy background and planning is underway to deploy our portfolio of energy technologies to advance our bitcoin mining business, with the goal of maximizing energy savings, increasing total power capacity, providing resilient electricity, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We are expanding our bitcoin mining business with the goal of reaching 2.0 EH/s in hashrate capacity at or near the end of December 31, 2021. We expect to exceed 3 EH/s in capacity by mid-to-late 2022. Hash rate capacity is one of the most important metrics for evaluating bitcoin mining companies. We obtain bitcoin as a result of our mining operations; while we retain a significant portion of the bitcoin, we have sold, and intend to sell bitcoin from time to time, to support our operations and strategic growth. We do not currently plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin (other than as necessary to convert our bitcoin to U.S. dollars) or to engage in hedging activities related to our holding of bitcoin; however, our decisions to hold or sell bitcoin at any given time may be impacted by the bitcoin market, which has been historically characterized by significant volatility. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell bitcoin that we hold, or the number of bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell bitcoins are currently determined by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time. Through our recently formed wholly owned subsidiaries, CSRE Properties, LLC, CSRE Property Management Company LLC, and CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, we maintain real property holdings for ATL and CleanBlok. Energy Segment We provide energy solutions through our wholly-owned subsidiaries CleanSpark, LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc., GridFabric, LLC, and Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. These solutions consist of engineering, design and software solutions , custom hardware solutions, Open Automated Demand response (“OpenADR”), solar, energy storage for microgrid and distributed energy systems to military, commercial and residential customers in Southern California and through the world . Our solutions are supported by our proprietary suite of software platforms (collectively, the “Platforms”) that include microgrid energy modeling, energy market communications and energy management solutions as summarized below: The Platforms were developed to enable the designing, building, and operating of distributed energy systems and microgrids which efficiently manage energy assets. These strategies are generally targeted to achieve resiliency and economic optimization. We also own patented gasification energy technologies. Our technology converts organic material into synthesis gas, which can be used as fuel for a variety of applications and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether). As previously disclosed, we currently plan to continue to focus on our other offerings. Other business activities Through p2kLabs, Inc., we provide design, software development, and other technology-based consulting services. The services provided are generally hourly or fixed-fee project-based arrangements. Through ATL, we also provide traditional data center services, such as providing customers with rack space, power and equipment, and offer several cloud services including virtual services, virtual storage, and data backup services. Markets, Geography and Major Customers Digital Currency Mining Segment Bitcoin is a global store and exchange of value used by people across the world as an asset and to conduct daily transactions. Mining bitcoin supports the global bitcoin blockchain and the millions of people that depend on it for economic security and other benefits. Strictly speaking, there is no customer market for mining bitcoin but we consider our mining pool operators as customers because they compensate us for providing processing power to the mining pool (see Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on our mining pool operators). We own and operate our own facilities and do not lease mining space to other mining companies or private individuals that mine. Our wholly-owned mining operations are located in the State of Georgia in the United States. We also have a relationship with a facility located in New York State that hosts a portion of our miners. Energy Segment Around the world, an aging energy infrastructure is becoming unstable and unreliable due to increases in loads and limited new, large-scale generation facilities. This inherent instability is compounded by the push to integrate a growing number and variety of renewable but intermittent energy generation assets and advanced technologies into outdated electrical grid systems. Defense installations, industrial complexes, communities, campuses and other aggregators across the world are turning to microgrids as a means to decrease their reliance on the grid, reduce utility costs, utilize cleaner power, and enhance energy security. The Company’s products and services predominantly serve the energy markets throughout the Americas in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. Federal, state and local governmental bodies provide incentives to owners and system integrators of solar energy systems to promote renewable energy in the form of rebates, tax credits, and other similar incentives. These incentives help to catalyze customer acceptance of renewable energy systems as an alternative to utility-provided power. Over the most recent year, our energy business operated extensively in California’s residential energy markets by participating in the state’s Self-Generation Incentive Program (“SGIP”). For the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, 61.2% and 64.8% of our total energy revenues were associated primarily with three customers. A loss or decline in business with these customers could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We provide our hardware products under manufacturing and distribution agreements. We provide our software and services at customer locations and from our office located in Carlsbad, California . Working Capital Items Digital Currency Mining Segment The bitcoin mining industry is highly competitive and dependent on specialized mining machines that have few manufacturers. Machine purchases require large down payments and miner deliveries often arrive many months after initial orders are placed. At the time the Company acquired ATL in December 2020, the Company had approximately 3,471 bitcoin mining units with application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”) in operation, which produced approximately 190 petahash/s. Since acquiring ATL, the Company has expanded its operations and purchased additional ASICs. The Company now has 12,900 ASICs (as of the date of this filing ) in daily operation, which are producing approximately 1.3 EH/s. In addition to the ASICs in operation, the Company has also entered into futures contracts, pursuant to which it has pre-paid significant down payments to acquire additional mining machines. The majority of miners we operate and expect to operate once received are the latest generation Antminers manufactured by Bitmain, including the S19, S19-Pro, and S19j-Pro. We believe that Bitmain’s miners are the most efficient and productive miners currently on the market, though that may change as new manufacturers enter the market. In addition to our currently deployed fleet of approximately 12,900 latest-generation miners (as of the date of this filing), we have purchased an additional 26,830 miners that are slated for delivery over the next 12 months. With the full deployment of these miners, our total fleet will consist of approximately 38,610 miners. Energy Segment We currently possess a significant amount of inventory, however, our short-term demand currently exceeds our current inventory levels. We are actively working with our current suppliers to satisfy our short-term and anticipated long-term needs. Due to current supply chain dynamics worldwide constraining our ability to secure certain inventory, these constraints have resulting in a significant customer backlog. Distribution, Marketing and Strategic Relationships Digital Currency Mining Segment We have developed strategic relationships with well-established companies in key areas including traditional and renewable energy, infrastructure, and bitcoin mining equipment procurement. Coinmint In addition to operating our own mining facilities, we may engage with third-parties to operate mining equipment on behalf of the Company. On July 8, 2021, CleanBlok entered into a services agreement with Coinmint, LLC (“Coinmint”). Pursuant to the agreement, Coinmint has agreed to house and power certain of our cryptocurrency mining equipment in its facilities, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to mine bitcoin on our behalf. All bitcoin mining services performed by Coinmint are conducted using mining equipment owned by the Company. As of the date of this filing, we have received and deployed approximately 6,700 total miners pursuant to the co-location mining services agreement at Coinmint’s facility in New York. Pursuant to the agreement, as consideration for the services, we pay Coinmint certain services fees, which are based on the operating costs incurred by Coinmint in performing the services, and a variable fee calculated based on the profitability of the bitcoin mined during the relevant payment period, subject to uptime performance commitments. The agreement has an initial term of one year, after which it will renew automatically for three-month periods until terminated in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Energy Segment We have developed strategic relationships with well-established companies in key areas including distribution and manufacturing. We sell our products worldwide, with a primary focus on Southern California and the Americas, through our direct product sales force, and partner networks. Materials and Suppliers Digital Currency Mining Segment We engage in high efficiency bitcoin mining by using ASICs. These specialized computers, often called mining rigs, have few manufacturers. A majority of the machines we purchased this year were manufactured by Bitmain, a Chinese company and the preeminent manufacturer of bitcoin mining rigs. In addition to ASICS, mining equipment includes networking equipment, power cords, racking, other specialized storage, transformers, and energy. We rely on utility providers for our power needs. These utilities buy into local energy mixes to source power. We make every effort to establish our facilities in locations serviced by utilities that generate a substantial portion of their energy from clean and renewable sources. We supplement the energy mix provided by our partners with the purchase of renewable energy credits because the precise ratio of renewable energy in local energy mixes is not within our control. We also intend to generate a portion of our own power through renewable solar energy by installing our microgrid solutions at our mining centers. Historically, we have been able to manage our supply chains effectively, but global supply chains are highly constrained, and we are experiencing substantial increases in shipping costs and unprecedented logistical delays as we make efforts to ensure timely delivery of equipment. There can be no certainty that we will not be affected in the future, and we believe that there is significant risk that equipment supply chains will be affected in 2022. Inflationary pressures may also impact our fiscal year 2022. Energy Segment Although most components essential to our energy business are generally available from multiple sources, we believe there are component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to us could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The Company also currently engages a contract manufacturer, whereby they exclusively manufacture parallel switchgear, automatic transfer switches and related control and circuit protective equipment for us. The Company sources energy storage devices (batteries) from a variety of vendors based on availability, cost, and quality. If we fail to maintain or expand our relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers, or if one or more that we rely upon to meet anticipated demand reduces or ceases production, it may be difficult to quickly identify and qualify alternatives on acceptable terms. In addition, equipment prices may increase in the coming years, or not decrease at the rates we historically have experienced, due to tariffs or other factors. In 2021, we experienced periodic supply chain constraints around certain inventory items, most notably battery energy supply systems. Global supply chains are highly constrained, and unprecedented logistical delays have the potential to impact our abilities timely delivery of equipment. There can be no certainty that we will not be affected in the future, and we believe that there is significant risk that equipment supply chains will be affected in 2022. Inflationary pressures may also impact our fiscal year 2022. Environmental Issues Digital Currency Mining and Energy Segments No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from the Company’s direct operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. Starting in the fourth calendar quarter of 2021, we began to voluntarily purchase renewable energy credits to offset a significant portion of our energy usage that is derived from non-renewable sources. The Company has also engaged market professionals to enhance and build a comprehensive environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) strategy. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets that we serve, nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Competition Digital Currency Mining Segment Bitcoin mining is a global activity. During our most recent fiscal year, a majority of bitcoin mining occurred in China. After China banned bitcoin mining in May 2021, the center of mining moved to North America. Although bitcoin mining by its nature is not a directly competitive business, all miners compete for bitcoin rewards; based on this, we define competitors as other bitcoin miners. Our competitors include large, publicly-listed mining companies, large private mining companies, and, in some cases, independent, individual miners who pool resources. We believe our principal competitive factors include our energy technology background, a combination of owned, operated, and co-located miners and facilities, our strategic use of the bitcoin we mine to fund growth, and our commitment to sustainable business practices, including sourcing renewable energy. Within North America, our major competitors include: In addition to the foregoing, we compete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on mining activities at scale. We face significant competition in certain operational aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, obtaining the lowest cost of electricity, obtaining clean energy sources, obtaining access to energy sites with reliable sources of power, and evaluating new technology developments in the industry. Energy Segment The markets we address in our energy operations are characterized by the presence of both new start-ups and well-established product providers. This industry is capital intensive and highly competitive. The ability to compete effectively is determined by product features, scalability, relative price, lifetime operating cost, product durability and reliability, safety, ease of integration, customer support, design innovation, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation. We offer turnkey energy solutions which include system design, installation and grid integration. Our P latforms are capable of interoperating with the local utility grid to help users optimize power for their homes or businesses. Our solutions are vendor agnostic . Our solutions are ideal for commercial, industrial, mining, defense, campus and community users, both small and large, with an aim to deliver power at or below the customers cost of utility power. These attributes contribute to our ability to compete with larger, more established competitors. Our major competitors include: Intellectual Property Digital Currency Mining Segment We do not currently own any patents in connection with our existing and planned digital currency mining related operations. We do rely, and expect to continue relying, upon trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Energy Segment In relation to our microgrid business, we own the following patent: Patent No. 9,941,696 B2 “ Establishing Communication and Power Sharing Links Between Components of a Distributed Energy System,” awarded April 10, 2018, which addresses our engineering and data-analytics technologies, processes and procedures. The patent covers our ability to receive data from a plurality of sources within a microgrid, which is then analyzed to forecast power needs across the microgrid, or a combination of multiple 'fractal' microgrids, and then determining whether or when to share power with the requesting module. In relation to our legacy gasifier business, we own the following patents: Patent No. 9,359,567 “Gasification Method Using Feedstock Comprising Gaseous Fuels;” Patent No. 8,518,133 “Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method;” Patent No. 8,105,401 “Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method;” Patent No. 8,347,829 “Electrolytic Reactor and Related Methods for Supplementing the Air Intake of an Internal Combustion Engine.” Another patent, ""Parallel Path Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method, US 9,890, 340 B2,"" awarded February 13, 2018, further enhanced our patent portfolio surrounding our proprietary gasification and waste-to-energy technologies. Our patents begin to expire between 2028 and 2035. Government Regulation Digital Currency Mining and Energy Segments We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. It is anticipated that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with existing federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and human health will not have a material effect upon us, our capital expenditures, or earnings. We cannot predict the effects of any additional regulation or legislation, enforcement policies thereunder and claims for damages for injuries to property, employees, other persons and the environment resulting from our operations. Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by state and federal authorities including the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA ” ). This regulation has not increased the cost of planning, designing and operating to date. Although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of these operations, there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities, including criminal or civil penalties, will not be incurred. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, including stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages for injuries to property or persons resulting from our activities could result in substantial costs and liabilities. In the conduct of our activities, our operations will be subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act ( “ OSHA ” ) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and similar state statutes require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in our operations. Certain of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in OSHA workplace standards. Blockchain technologies and digital currencies, including bitcoin, are increasingly becoming subject to governmental regulation, both in the U.S. and internationally. B lockchain technologies and cryptocurrency are under review with a number of U.S. governmental agencies, including, without limitation, the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. State and local regulations also may apply to our digital currency mining. Other governmental or quasi-governmental regulatory bodies have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in digital currency related business. For instance, the Cyber-Digital Task Force of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) published a report entitled “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework” in October 2020. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the possible threats and enforcement challenges the DOJ views as associated with the use and prevalence of digital currencies, amongst other things. Further, in early March 2021, the SEC chairperson nominee expressed an intent to focus on investor protection issues raised by cryptocurrencies. Presently, we do not believe any U.S. or State regulatory body has taken any action or position adverse to our digital currency mining activities; however, future changes to existing regulations or entirely new regulations may affect our business in ways it is not presently possible for us to predict with any reasonable degree of reliability. In addition, regulators and the media have expressed concerns related to the potential environmental impacts of bitcoin mining, and its energy-intensive nature in particular. We are not materially impacted by any current regulations targeted toward the digital currency mining industry. Other than the above regulations and maintaining our good standing in the states in which we operate, complying with applicable local business licensing requirements, complying with all state and federal tax requirements, preparing our periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and complying with other applicable securities laws, rules, and regulations, we do not believe that existing governmental regulations will have a material effect on our operations. Certain governmental and quasi-governmental bodies are considering additional regulations in the bitcoin mining and energy industries; it is not currently known whether any such regulations would have a material impact on our businesses. We do not currently require the approval of any governmental agency or affiliated program for our operations. In the future we may become subject to new laws and/or regulations, such as further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect our digital currency mining and other activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see the Section entitled “Risk Factors,” below. Product Development Digital Currency Mining and Energy Segments Because the distributed energy and related software industry is still in a relatively early state of adoption, our ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. We continue to enhance our existing products in order to drive further commercialization. We may also expand the range of our product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. Bitcoin mining by its nature has no products. Human Capital Resources; Employees; Personnel Digital Currency Mining and Energy Segments We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. As of December 1, 2021, we had 87 staff members, 86 of which were full time. Employees participate in equity incentive plans and receive generous compensation in the form of salary and benefits. We continually seek to hire and retain talented professionals, although the competition for such personnel in our segments is significant. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. Company Websites We maintain a corporate website at: www.cleanspark.com and informational websites for our subsidiaries at www.cleanblok.com, www.gridfabric.io , and www.p2klabs.com. The contents of these websites are not incorporated in, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report. We file reports with the SEC, which are available on our website free of charge. These reports include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Section 16 filings on Form 3, Form 4, and Form 5, and other related filings, each of which is provided on our website as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file such materials with or furnish them to the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, including the Company. Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize, that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Risk Factors Summary Below is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below and should be carefully considered, together with other information included in this Annual Report. Risks Related to Our Business Our business has been, and in the future may be, subject to risks arising from pandemic, epidemic, or an outbreak of diseases, such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. Since then, COVID-19 has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity, including through quarantines, travel bans and restrictions, shelter-in-place orders, shutdowns of businesses, reductions in business activity, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. These measures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, as well as the operations of our customers, our partners and our vendors and suppliers. Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, and many of our key suppliers, are located in regions which have been and continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been affected by COVID-19 and may continue to experience material impacts well beyond the end of the pandemic. Specifically, the manufacture of components of our products, the final assembly of our products, and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations that have been impacted by COVID-19 and in which local governments continue to take measures to try to contain the pandemic. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. Such measures, as well as restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and other factors have adversely affected our supply chain, consistent with its effect across many industries, including creating shipping and logistics challenges and placing significant limits on component supplies. These effects on our supply chain have resulted in delayed product availability in our energy business, especially when combined with the demand for our products, and have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to meet our energy product demand, result in additional costs, or may otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations. They have also significantly increased the costs of shipping miners, related components and infrastructure. We expect these impacts, including delayed product availability, to continue for as long as the global supply chain is experiencing these challenges. The spread of COVID-19 has also caused us to modify our business practices as we comply with state-mandated requirements for safety in the workplace to ensure the health, safety, and welling-being of our employees. While the company has implemented a Vaccination and Testing Policy, we still maintain other measures includ ing personal protective equipment, social distancing, cleanliness of our facilities, and daily monitoring of the health of employees in our facilities, as well as modifying our policies on employee travel and the cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences. We may take further actions in response to the pandemic as may be required by government authorities or that we may determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. However, we have not developed a specific and comprehensive contingency plan designed to address the challenges and risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and, even if and when we do develop such a plan, there can be no assurance that such plan will be effective in mitigating the potential adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, while the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular are difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our working capital and liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall spending, adversely affecting demand for our products and services, our business, and the value of our common stock. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, further related restrictions on travel, any reopening plans, the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, including, without limitation, the effectiveness and timing of vaccination initiatives in the United States and worldwide and the duration, timing, and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, even after the pandemic subsides, could have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of capital and financial condition, though the full extent and duration of any such impact is also uncertain. Supply chain and shipping disruptions have resulted in shipping delays, a significant increase in shipping costs, and could increase product costs and result in lost sales, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Supply chain disruptions, resulting from factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, labor supply and shipping container shortages, have impacted, and may continue to impact, us and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers. These disruptions have resulted in longer lead times and increased product costs and shipping expenses, including with respect to the delivery of miners that we have purchased. While we have taken steps to minimize the impact of these increased costs by working closely with our suppliers and customers, there can be no assurances that unforeseen events impacting the supply chain will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. Additionally, the impacts supply chain disruptions have on our third-party manufacturers and suppliers are not within our control. It is not currently possible to predict how long it will take for these supply chain disruptions to cease. Prolonged supply chain disruptions impacting us and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers could interrupt product manufacturing, increased lead times, increased product costs and result in lost sales and bitcoin production, result in a delay in the delivery of miners that we have purchased, and continue to increase shipping costs associated with the delivery of our purchased miners, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses and negative cash flow, and we may never achieve consistent profitability. Our limited operating history, including our recent entry into the digital currency mining business, makes it difficult to evaluate our business and predict our future results of operations. Although we have achieved profitable quarters in the past, to date, we have not maintained consistent profitability from period to period, and no assurances can be made that we will achieve consistent profitability in the near future, if ever. From the Company’s inception through September 30, 2021, we sustained $138,392,118 in cumulative net losses, and we had a net loss for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 of $21,812,010. We have generated these losses as we attempt to implement our business plan, including expanding our existing products and customer base. We will not achieve consistent profitability unless and until we can develop a substantial and stable revenue base. Our future success is difficult to predict because we operate in emerging and evolving industries that are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles. The renewable energy, bitcoin mining, microgrid and related industries are emerging and evolving, which may lead to period-to-period variability in our operating results and may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our energy products and services are based on unique technology that we believe offers significant advantages to our customers, but the markets we serve are in a relatively early stage of development and it is uncertain how rapidly they will develop. It is also uncertain whether our energy products will achieve high levels of demand and acceptance as these markets grow. If companies and customers in the industries we serve do not perceive or value the benefits of our technologies and products, or if they are unwilling to adopt our products as alternatives to traditional power solutions, the market for our products and services may not develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, which could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. As a supplier to the renewable energy, microgrid and related industries, we may be subject to business cycles, the timing, length, and volatility of which may be difficult to predict. The cyclical nature of our business may be driven by sudden changes in customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers’ products, inventory levels relative to demand and access to affordable capital. These changes may affect the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology, and affect our orders, net sales, operating expenses, and net income. In addition, we may not be able to respond adequately or quickly to any declines in demand by reducing our costs. To meet rapidly changing demand in each of the industries we serve, we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity. During periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, effectively manage our supply chain, and motivate and retain key employees. During periods of increasing demand for our products, we must have sufficient inventory to fulfill customer orders, effectively manage our supply chain, and attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned within a business cycle, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may be unable to successfully compete. We compete in the highly competitive market for renewable energy products and microgrid technology and associated services , as well as in certain operational aspects of our digital currency mining business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, obtaining the lowest cost of electricity, obtaining clean energy sources, obtaining access to energy sites with reliable sources of power, and evaluating new technology developments in the industry . Evolving industry standards, rapid price changes and product obsolescence impact the market and its various participants, including us. Our competitors include many domestic and foreign companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage. Our current competitors or new market entrants could introduce new or enhanced technologies, products or services with features that render our technologies, products or services obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. The success of our energy business will be dependent upon our ability to develop products that are superior to existing products and products introduced in the future, and which are cost effective. In addition, we may be required to continually enhance any products that are developed as well as introduce new products that keep pace with technological change and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of the marketplace. Even if our current technologies prove to be commercially feasible, there is extensive research and development being conducted on alternative energy sources that may render our technologies and protocols obsolete or otherwise non-competitive. The success of our digital currency mining business will be further dependent upon our ability to purchase additional miners, adapt to changes in technology in the industry, and to obtain sufficient energy at reasonable prices, amongst other things. We may also be unable to keep pace with the technological demands of the marketplace or successfully develop products that will succeed in the marketplace. Since many of our competitors are larger, well-established companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other resources than us, we are at an inherent competitive disadvantage. We may not have the capital resources available to undertake the research that may be necessary to upgrade our equipment or develop new devices to meet the efficiencies of changing technologies. Our inability to adapt to technological change could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. We rely on a variety of intellectual property rights to protect our technology, and enforcing those rights could disrupt our business operation and divert resources that could ultimately harm our future prospects. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and procedures and patents to protect our proprietary technologies. Our business primarily relies upon trade secret laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and work-for-hire provisions, to protect our technology, know-how and other proprietary information. It may be cost prohibitive for us to seek to enforce such rights through the legal-enforcement mechanisms available to us, and, in any case, such laws and contractual restrictions may not provide meaningful protection to us against the possible unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets. In relation to our microgrid business, we also own patents that protect our ability to receive data from a plurality of sources within a microgrid, which is then analyzed to forecast power needs across the microgrid, or a combination of multiple ‘fractal’ microgrids, and then determine whether or when to share power with the requesting module. The claims contained in those and any other patents we own may not provide adequate protection for our products and technology. In the absence of patent protection, our competitors may attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know-how. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to our technology to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. In addition, our ongoing expansion of our business, including, in particular, through the development of products, may result in claims of intellectual property infringement, regardless of merit. If an infringement claim or other dispute arises concerning our technology, we could become involved in litigation that might involve substantial cost. Litigation could divert substantial management attention away from our operations and into efforts to enforce our patents, protect our trade secrets or know-how or determine the scope of the proprietary rights of others. If a proceeding resulted in adverse findings, we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties, and we might also be required to seek licenses from third parties to manufacture or sell our products. Our ability to manufacture and sell our products may also be adversely affected by other unforeseen factors relating to any such proceeding or its outcome. A significant part of our success will depend on our ability to manage our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers. We rely upon a limited number of suppliers to provide the components necessary to build our energy products and contract manufacturers to procure components and assemble our products. In addition, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for the purchase and delivery of our miners to support our digital currency mining operations. There can be no assurance that such key suppliers and contract manufacturers will provide components , products or miners in a timely and cost-efficient manner or otherwise meet our needs and expectations. Any disruption in such key suppliers’ or contract manufacturers could delay our ability to provide our products to our customers or to expand our digital currency mining operations . Our ability to manage such relationships and timely replace suppliers and contract manufacturers, if necessary, is critical to our success. Our failure to timely replace our contract manufacturers and suppliers, should that become necessary, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers. For example, we depend on Bitmain for the majority of our mining rigs and Pioneer Custom Electrical Products Corp. as a sole source contract manufacturer of our switchgear product lines, and any change in their ability to manufacture and deliver these products could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Our success is dependent upon our relationships with certain key customers. In the past, w e have derived a significant portion of our revenues from a relatively limited number of customers. Our dependence on a limited number of customers may continue in the future. The loss of any one of our major customers or decrease in demand by those customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and our cash flows. We have limited experience selling our distributed energy focused products and solutions for use in residential markets, and our increased efforts in this regard may not be as successful as we expect or at all. A s a result of our recent acquisition of Solar Watt, we now are provid ing solar and alternative energy solutions for homeowners, as well as commercial businesses, and have developed a proprietary platform to enable integration and optimization of solar, energy storage and back-up solutions for residential applications. Historically, however, our products and solutions have been primarily sold into commercial and governmental markets. We have limited experience pursuing the residential markets, and there are unique challenges associated with sales to homeowners and others in the residential market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in growing profitably (or at all) sales of our residential market focused products and solutions or otherwise achieving success in our efforts in this regard. Further, the success of these efforts will depend on part on expansion of homeowner use of solar energy. To date, solar energy has only achieved limited market acceptance (particularly in regions outside of Southern California, in which regions we intend to expand our services and capabilities), and its continued market acceptance and growth may depend on continued support in the form of performance-based incentives, rebates, tax credits and other incentives from federal, state, local and foreign governments. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop our planned proprietary platform to enable integration and optimization of solar, energy storage and back-up generators for residential applications. Our solar energy business is concentrated in Southern California, putting us at risk of region-specific disruptions. Our solar energy customer base is currently concentrated in Southern California, and we expect many of our future solar energy installations to be in California, which could further concentrate our solar energy customer base and operational infrastructure. Accordingly, our business and results of operations are particularly susceptible to adverse economic, regulatory, political, weather and other conditions in California, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and any legislative changes related to grid operations . If we are the subject of future product defect or liability suits, or our products are subject to a recall, our business and our reputation could be adversely affected. In the course of our planned operations, we may become subject to legal actions based on a claim that our energy products are defective in workmanship or have caused personal or other injuries. We may also be subject to lawsuits and other claims in the future if our products malfunction, including, for example, if any of our solar service offerings (such as our racking systems, photovoltaic modules, batteries, inverters, or other products) causes injuries. Because solar energy systems and many of our other current and anticipated products are electricity-producing devices, it is possible that customers or their property could be injured or damaged by our products, whether due to product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. Further, since our products are used in systems that are made up of components sourced from third party manufacturers, we may be subject to product liability claims even if our products do not malfunction. Additionally, any of our products could be subject to recalls due to product malfunctions or defects. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages that could require us to make significant payments, as well as subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position and adversely affect sales of our systems and other products. We rely on third-party manufacturing warranties, warranties provided by our manufacturing partners and our general liability insurance to cover product liability claims and have not obtained separate product liability insurance. Such warranties and insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims. Moreover, even if such warranties and insurance coverage are sufficient, any successful claim could significantly harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, product liability claims, injuries, defects or other problems experienced by other companies in the industries in which we operate could lead to unfavorable market conditions for the industry as a whole, and may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract customers and thereby have an adverse effect our growth and financial performance. We rely heavily on our management team, whose continued service and performance is critical to our future success. Any failure by management to properly manage growth, including hiring and retaining competent and skilled management and other personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We currently have four executive officers — our Chief Executive Officer and President, Zachary Bradford, our Chief Financial Officer, Lori Love, our Chief Revenue Officer, Amer Tadayon, and S. Matthew Schulz, our Executive Chairman — who are responsible for our management functions and are responsible for strategic development, financing and other critical functions. Some of the members of our management team and our board of directors may not have prior experience in the energy or cryptocurrency mining industries. This lack of experience may impair our management teams’ and directors’ ability to evaluate and make well-informed decisions involving our current operations and any future projects we may undertake in the industries in which we operate. Such impairment and lack of experience could adversely affect our business, financial condition and future operations. Our future success depends significantly on the continued service and performance of our existing management team. The departure, death, disability or other extended loss of services of any member of our management team, particularly with little or no notice, could cause delays on projects, frustrate our growth prospects and could have an adverse impact on our client and industry relationships, our project exploration and development programs, other aspects of our business and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects. Our success, growth prospects, and ability to capitalize on market opportunities also depend to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire, motivate and retain qualified managerial personnel, including additional senior members of management. Our growth may be constrained by resource limitations as competitors and customers compete for increasingly scarce human capital resources. The demand for trained software engineers, electrical engineers, professionals familiar with cryptocurrency mining and other skilled workers is currently high. Our competitors may be able to offer a work environment with higher compensation or more opportunities than we can. Any new personnel we hire may not be or become as productive as we expect, as we may face challenges in adequately or appropriately integrating them into our workforce and culture. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, our ability to successfully implement our business plan, grow our company and maintain or expand our product offerings may be adversely affected, and the costs of doing so may increase, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our expansion could also place significant demands on our management, operations, systems, accounting, internal controls and financial resources. If we experience difficulties in any of these areas, we may not be able to expand our business successfully or effectively manage our growth. Any failure by management to manage growth and to respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have engaged in, and in the future may engage in, strategic acquisitions and other arrangements that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders, reduce our financial resources and harm our operating results. We have previously engaged in strategic transactions, including acquisitions of companies, product lines, technologies and personnel, such as our recent acquisitions of ATL in December 2020 and Solar Watt in February 2021, and, as part of our growth strategy, in the future, we may seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by pursuing strategic transactions. Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend on the availability of, and our ability to identify, suitable acquisition and investment opportunities at an acceptable cost, our ability to compete effectively to attract those opportunities and the availability of financing to complete acquisitions. Future acquisitions may require us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership, assume or otherwise be subject to liabilities of an acquired company, record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, incur large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses, and become subject to litigation. The benefits of an acquisition may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular acquisition will produce the intended benefits in a timely manner or to the extent anticipated or at all. We may experience difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company or be subjected to liability for the target’s pre-acquisition activities or operations as a successor in interest. Such integration may divert management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business. Future acquisitions may also expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience (such as our acquisition of our ATL subsidiary, in light of its cryptocurrency mining operations), especially when competitors in such markets have stronger market positions, the possibility of insufficient revenues to offset the expenses we incur in connection with an acquisition and potential loss of, or harm to, our relationships with employees, customers, consumers and suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses. Our energy business is substantially dependent on utility rate structures and government incentive programs that encourage the use of alternative energy sources. The reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for energy-related technologies would harm our business. We believe that near-term growth of energy-related technologies, including power conversion and solar energy technology, relies partly on the availability and size of government and economic incentives and grants (including, but not limited to, the U.S. Investment Tax Credit and various state and local incentive programs). These incentive programs could be challenged by utility companies, or for other reasons found to be unconstitutional, or could be reduced or discontinued for other reasons, all of which are outside of our control. The reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives could harm our business. A combination of utility rate structures and government subsidies that encourage the use of alternative energy sources is a primary driver of demand for our energy products. For example, public utilities are often allowed to collect demand charges on commercial and industrial customers in addition to traditional usage charges. In addition, the federal government and many states encourage the use of alternative energy sources through a combination of direct subsidies and tariff incentives such as net metering for users that use alternative energy sources such as solar power. California also encourages alternative energy technology through its Self-Generation Incentive Program, or SGIP, which offers rebates for businesses and consumers who adopt certain new technologies. Other states have similar incentives and mandates which encourage the adoption of alternative energy sources. Notwithstanding the adoption of other incentive programs, we expect that California will be the most significant market for the sale of our energy products in the near term. Should California or another state in which we derive a substantial portion of our product revenues in the future change its utility rate structure or eliminate or significantly reduce its incentive programs, demand for our products could be substantially affected, which would adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and operating results. In the future, we may require additional financing to sustain and expand our operations, and we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects. Our ability to operate profitably and to grow our business is dependent upon, among other things, generating sufficient revenue from our operations and, when and if needed, obtaining financing. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to operate and/or expand our business, we will be required to raise additional capital to fund operating deficits (if applicable) and growth of our business, pursue our business plans and to finance our operating activities, including through equity or debt financings, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, stockholder ownership interest in the Company may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights as a stockholder. Debt and equity financings, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as redeeming our shares of common stock, making investments, incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. We maintain our cash at financial institutions, which at times, exceed federally insured limits. The majority of our cash is held in accounts at U.S. banking institutions that we believe are of high quality. Cash held in non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing operating accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. If such banking institutions were to fail, we could lose all or a portion of those amounts held in excess of such insurance limitations. If we fail to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the market may have reduced confidence in our reported financial information. We must continue to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We will continue to perform the documentation and evaluations needed to comply with Section 404. If during this process our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective, which may cause market participants to have reduced confidence in our reported financial condition. Risks Related to Our Cryptocurrency Mining Operations Through our acquisition of ATL in December 2020, we expanded our business to include bitcoin mining, and we are actively trying to grow our bitcoin mining infrastructure, equipment and capacity. Bitcoin mining is a significant portion of our business and revenues and is expected to continue to be the source of a majority of our revenues in the future. Our bitcoin mining activities, both now and in the future, may subject us to inherent risks, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report . If regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require our registration as a money services business (an “MSB”) under the regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”), or otherwise under state laws, we may incur significant compliance costs, which could be substantial or cost-prohibitive. If we become subject to these regulations, our costs in complying with them may have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations. To the extent our bitcoin mining activities cause us to be deemed an MSB under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the BSA, we may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate us to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records. To the extent that our cryptocurrency activities cause us to be deemed a “money transmitter” ​(an “MT”) or be given an equivalent designation, under state law in any state in which we operate, we may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. Currently, the New York State Department of Financial Services maintains a comprehensive “BitLicense” framework for businesses that conduct “virtual currency business activity.” In July 2020, Louisiana enacted the Virtual Currency Businesses Act, becoming the second state after New York to enact a stand-alone virtual currency law. We will continue to monitor for developments in state-level legislation, guidance or regulations applicable to us. Such additional federal or state regulatory obligations in the United States or obligations that could arise under the regulatory frameworks of other countries may cause us to incur significant expenses, possibly affecting its business and financial condition in a material and adverse manner. Furthermore, we and our service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to MSBs and MTs or similar obligations in other countries. If we are deemed to be subject to such additional regulatory and registration or licensing requirements, we may be required to substantially alter our bitcoin mining activities and possibly cease engaging in such activities. Any such action may adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and an investment in our company. Current regulation regarding the exchange of bitcoins under the CEA by the CFTC is unclear; to the extent we become subject to regulation by the CFTC in connection with our exchange of bitcoin, we may incur additional compliance costs, which may be significant. The Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the “CEA”) , does not currently impose any direct obligations on us related to the mining or exchange of bitcoins. Generally , the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), the federal agency that administers the CEA, regards bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as commodities. This position has been supported by decisions of federal courts. However, the CEA imposes requirements relative to certain transactions involving bitcoin and other digital assets that constitute a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option on such a contract), a swap, or a transaction involving margin, financing or leverage that does not result in actual delivery of the commodity within 28 days to persons not defined as “eligible contract participants” or “eligible commercial entities” under the CEA (e.g., retail persons). Changes in the CEA or the regulations promulgated by the CFTC thereunder, as well as interpretations thereof and official promulgations by the CFTC, may impact the classification of bitcoins and, therefore, may subject them to additional regulatory oversight by the agency. Although to date the CFTC has not enacted regulations governing non-derivative or non-financed, margined or leveraged transactions in bitcoin, it has authority to commence enforcement actions against persons who violate certain prohibitions under the CEA related to transactions in any contract of sale of any commodity, including bitcoin, in interstate commerce (e.g., manipulation and engaging in certain deceptive practices). We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins under the law. Any requirements imposed by the CFTC related to our mining activities or our transactions in bitcoin could cause us to incur additional extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company. In addition, changes in the classification of bitcoins could subject us, as a result of our bitcoin mining operations, to additional regulatory oversight by the agency. Although to date the CFTC has not enacted regulations governing non-derivative or non-financed, margined or leveraged transactions in bitcoin, it has authority to commence enforcement actions against persons who violate certain prohibitions under the CEA related to transactions in any contract of sale of any commodity, including bitcoin, in interstate commerce (e.g., manipulation and engaging in certain deceptive practices). Moreover, if our mining activities or transactions in bitcoin were deemed by the CFTC to constitute a collective investment in derivatives for our shareholders, we may be required to register as a commodity pool operator with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in the Company. While no provision of the CEA, or CFTC rules, orders or rulings (except as noted herein) appears to be currently applicable to our business, this is subject to change. If the SEC or another regulatory body considers bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency that we may mine in the future to be a security under U.S. securities laws, we may be required to comply with significant SEC registration and/or other requirements. In general, novel or unique assets such as bitcoin and other digital assets may be classified as securities if they meet the definition of investment contracts under U.S. law. In recent years, the offer and sale of digital assets other than bitcoin, most notably Kik Interactive Inc.’s Kin tokens and Telegram Group Inc.’s TON tokens, have been deemed to be investment contracts by the SEC. While we believe that bitcoin is unlikely to be considered an investment contract, and thus a security under the investment contract definition, we cannot provide any assurances that digital assets that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, including bitcoin, will never be classified as securities under U.S. law. To the extent that any digital asset we have already mined or will mine is deemed a security, we may be obligated to comply with registration and/or other requirements by the SEC. This would cause us to incur significant, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in the Company. If regulations or interpretations change and regulation of bitcoin under the U.S. securities laws or otherwise is promulgated, we may be classified as an investment company. Current and future legislation and the SEC’s rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which bitcoin is treated for classification and clearing purposes. The SEC’s July 25, 2017 Report expressed its view that digital assets may be securities depending on the facts and circumstances. As of the date of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any rules that have been proposed to regulate bitcoin as a security, and SEC staff have publicly suggested that bitcoin is not a security for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), because current purchasers of bitcoin are not relying on the essential managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of others to produce a profit. We cannot be certain, however, as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoin under the law. For example, in the event that the bitcoin (or, in the future, any digital assets) held by us, whether as a result of our cryptocurrency mining business or otherwise (including by acquisition), are determined to constitute securities under the U.S. securities laws and such assets exceed 40% of our total assets, exclusive of cash, we would inadvertently become an investment company under the 1940 Act. Classification as an investment company under the 1940 Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to register, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time-consuming and restrictive and may require a restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could engage in as a registered investment company. Further, we would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would need to file reports under the 1940 Act. The cost of compliance with the 1940 Act and any other regulations applicable to our crypto mining business would result in our incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to properly register with the SEC or otherwise if required would have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations. It may be illegal now, or in the future, to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell or use bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize similar cryptocurrency assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which could adversely affect us. Although currently cryptocurrencies generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, several countries, such as China, India and Russia, may continue taking regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell or use these cryptocurrency assets or to exchange for local currency. For example, in China and Russia (India is currently proposing new legislation), it is illegal to accept payment in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrencies. In addition, in March 2021, the governmental authorities for the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia banned bitcoin mining in the province due to the industry’s intense electrical power demands and its negative environmental impacts. If other countries, including the U.S., implement similar restrictions, such restrictions may adversely affect us. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and thus harm investors. There are several new and existing competitors in our industry that are purchasing mining equipment at scale, which may cause delays or difficulty in us obtaining new miners. Many of the competitors in our industry have also been purchasing mining equipment at scale, which has caused a world-wide shortage of mining equipment and extended the corresponding delivery schedules for new miner purchases. There are no assurances that Bitmain, or any other manufacturers, will be able to keep pace with the surge in demand for mining equipment. It is uncertain how manufacturers will respond to this increased global demand and whether they can deliver on the schedules promised to all of their customers. In the event Bitmain or other manufacturers, are not able to keep pace with demand, we may not be able to purchase additional miners in sufficient quantities, on the delivery schedules that meet our business needs, or at favorable prices. The impact of geopolitical and economic events on the demand for bitcoin is uncertain. Geopolitical crises may trigger large-scale purchases of bitcoin, which could rapidly increase their prices. This may, however, also increase the likelihood of a subsequent price swing in the opposite direction as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, ultimately decreasing the value of bitcoins or any other digital asset in our possession. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in generally uncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold. Alternatively, global crises and economic downturns may discourage investment in bitcoin and digital assets in general as investors shift their investments towards less volatile asset classes. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. The value of bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been subject to wide swings. Because we do not currently hedge our investment in bitcoin and do not intend to for the foreseeable future, we may be directly exposed to bitcoin’s price volatility and surrounding risks. While bitcoin prices are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms, they have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoins, the maintenance and development of the software protocol of the bitcoin network, changes in consumer demographics and public tastes, fraudulent or illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Furthermore, pricing may be the result of, and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of bitcoin, or our share price, making prices more volatile or creating “bubble” type risks. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell bitcoin that we hold, or the number of bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell bitcoins are currently determined by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time. Such decisions, however well-informed, may result in untimely sales and even losses, adversely affecting an investment in us. At this time, we do not anticipate engaging in any hedging activities related to our holding of bitcoin; this could expose us to substantial decreases in the price of bitcoin. The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or other alternatives. The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to abandon bitcoin. As we exclusively mine, and expect to exclusively mine bitcoin, we could face difficulty adapting to emergent digital ledgers, blockchains, or alternatives thereto. This could prevent us from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account and harm investors. Bitcoin faces significant challenges with scaling which, if not overcome, may lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times. Bitcoin is presently limited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second. Developers and contributors in the bitcoin ecosystem debate potential solutions to increasing the average number of transactions per second that networks can handle. Some have implemented mechanisms or are researching ways to increase scale, such as increasing the allowable sizes of blocks, and therefore the number of transactions per block, which would increase the number of transactions that could occur per second. However, it is uncertain how long those mechanisms being explored to increase the scale of settlement of bitcoin transactions will take to become effective, if at all. Any failure to improve bitcoin settlement times could materially affect the price of bitcoin and, as a result, adversely affect an investment in us. Bitcoin is subject to halving; the reward for successfully solving a block will halve several times in the future and its value may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction in the rewards we receive from our mining efforts. Halving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm. In an event referred to as bitcoin “halving,” the bitcoin reward for mining any block is cut in half. For example, the mining reward for bitcoin declined from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoin on May 11, 2020. This process is scheduled to occur once every 210,000 blocks, or roughly four years, until the total amount of bitcoin rewards issued reaches 21 million, which is expected to occur around 2140. Once 21 million bitcoin are generated, the network will stop producing more. Currently, there are more than 18 million bitcoin in circulation. While bitcoin prices have had a history of price fluctuations around halving events, there is no guarantee that the price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the price of bitcoin does not follow these anticipated halving events, the revenue from our mining operations would decrease, and we may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease mining operations altogether, which may adversely affect an investment in us. Furthermore, such reductions in bitcoin rewards for uncovering blocks may result in a reduction in the aggregate hash rate of the bitcoin network as the incentive for miners decreases. Miners ceasing operations would reduce the collective processing power on the network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions and make the bitcoin network more vulnerable to malicious actors or botnets obtaining control in excess of 50 % of the processing power active on the blockchain. Such events may adversely affect our activities and an investment in us. If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on the bitcoin network, such actor or botnet could manipulate the network to adversely affect us, which would adversely affect an investment in us. If a malicious actor or botnet, a collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers, obtains over 50% of the processing power dedicated to mining bitcoin, such actor may be able to construct fraudulent blocks or prevent certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at all. The malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the order of transactions, though it could not generate new units or transactions using such control. The malicious actor could also “double-spend,” or spend the same bitcoin in more than one transaction, or it could prevent transactions from being validated. In certain instances, reversing any fraudulent or malicious changes made to the bitcoin blockchain may not be possible. Although there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of blockchains achieved through controlling over 50% of the processing power on the bitcoin network, it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded, and could exceed, the 50% threshold on the bitcoin network. This possibility creates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of bitcoin transactions. To the extent that the bitcoin ecosystem, and the administrators of mining pools, do not have adequate controls and responses in place, the risk of a malicious actor obtaining control of the processing power may increase. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account and harm investors. Our reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may adversely affect an investment in us. We currently rely on Foundry Digital and Antpool (“pools” or “Cryptocurrency Customers”), open access mining pools that support cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, to receive our mining rewards and fees from the network. Our pools have the sole discretion to modify the terms of our agreement at any time, and, therefore, our future rights and relationship with our pools may change. In general, mining pools allow miners to combine their computing and processing power, increasing their chances of solving a block and getting paid by the bitcoin network. The rewards, distributed proportionally to our contribution to the pool’s overall mining power, are distributed by the pool operator. Should our pools’ operator systems suffer downtime due to a cyber-attack, software malfunction or other similar issues, it will negatively impact our ability to mine and receive revenue. Furthermore, while we receive daily reports from our pools detailing the total processing power provided to the pools and the proportion of that total processing power, we provided to determine the distribution of rewards to us, we are dependent on the accuracy of our pool’s record keeping. Therefore, we have little means of recourse against our pools’ operators if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by the mining pool operator is incorrect, other than leaving the pools. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our pools, we may experience reduced rewards for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations. Bitcoins and other digital assets we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access. There is a risk that some or all of our bitcoins could be lost or stolen. Bitcoins are stored in and accessed by cryptocurrency sites commonly referred to as “wallets.” A hot wallet refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the Internet. Generally, hot wallets are easier to set up and access than wallets in cold storage, but they are also more susceptible to hackers and other technical vulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold storage is generally more secure than hot storage, but is not ideal for quick or regular transactions. When we keep our bitcoin in cold storage, we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of our cryptocurrency assets. We currently mine bitcoin by contributing to and benefiting from our pools’ processing power. Our share of bitcoins mined from our pools are initially received by us in wallets we control, which are maintained by Coinbase Inc., a U.S. based digital assets exchange. We maintain the majority of our bitcoin in cold storage with a minority allocation kept in hot wallets for working capital purposes. Bitcoins we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access. Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure bitcoins, such as by attacking the bitcoin network source code, exchange miners, third-party platforms (including Coinbase), cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of substantial holdings of bitcoin, and as we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments and profitability. The loss or destruction of private keys required to access our bitcoins may be irreversible. Our loss of access to our private keys or our experience of a data loss relating to our bitcoins could adversely affect an investment in us. Bitcoins may only be controlled by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which they are held. We publish the public key relating to digital wallets in use when we verify the receipt or transfers of bitcoins to and from our wallets and disseminate such information into the network on an anonymous basis, but we safeguard the private keys relating to such digital wallets. Digital asset exchanges, such as Coinbase, where we hold our bitcoin, engage in similar practices. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our bitcoins and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our bitcoins whether by us or digital asset exchanges where we hold our bitcoin, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. Incorrect or fraudulent bitcoin transactions may be irreversible. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and stolen or incorrectly transferred bitcoins may thus be irretrievable. While we exchange our bitcoins directly for U.S. dollars on Coinbase and do not presently use, or expect to use, our bitcoins for any other transactions, any incorrectly executed or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions may still adversely affect our investments and assets. Forks in the bitcoin network may occur in the future, which may affect the value of bitcoins held by us. A small group of contributors can propose refinements or improvements to the bitcoin network’s source code that alter the protocols and software that govern the bitcoin network and the properties of bitcoin, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new bitcoin. This is known as a “fork.” In the event a developer or group of developers proposes modifications to the bitcoin network that are not accepted by a majority of miners and users, but that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial plurality of miners and users, two or more competing and incompatible blockchain implementations could result. This is known as a “hard fork.” The value of bitcoin after the creation of a fork is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, the value of the fork product, market reaction to the creation of the fork product, and the occurrence of forks in the future. As such, existing forks, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, and future forks may have a negative effect on bitcoin’s value and may adversely affect an investment in us. The open-source structure of the bitcoin network protocol means that the contributors to the protocol are generally not directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the protocol. A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the bitcoin network and an investment in us. As an open-source project, bitcoin does not generate revenues for its contributors, and contributors are generally not compensated for maintaining and updating the bitcoin network protocol. The lack of guaranteed financial incentives for contributors to maintain or develop the bitcoin network and the lack of guaranteed resources to adequately address emerging issues with the bitcoin network may reduce incentives to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner. To the extent that contributors may fail to adequately update and maintain the bitcoin network protocol, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. Banks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities. A number of companies that engage in bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions. To the extent that such events may happen to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. Our interactions with the bitcoin network may expose us to SDN or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distributed ledger technology. The Office of Financial Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the US Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its specially designated nationals (“SDN”) list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. We also may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the persons with whom we transact. The digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, trade are relatively new and largely unregulated, and thus may be exposed to fraud and failure. Such failures may result in a reduction in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and can adversely affect an investment in us. Digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies trade are relatively new and, in most cases, largely unregulated. Many digital exchanges do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, cryptocurrency exchanges, including prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of the volume of digital asset trading. A lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated regulation may reduce confidence in digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in cryptocurrency values. These potential consequences of a digital asset exchange’s failure could adversely affect an investment in us. We may not have adequate sources of recovery if our digital assets are lost, stolen or destroyed. We rely on Coinbase to facilitate the custody of our bitcoins. If our bitcoins are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party, including Coinbase, liable to us, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy our claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for us might be limited, to the extent identifiable, to other responsible third parties (e.g., a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim of ours. Bitcoins held by us are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections. We do not hold our bitcoins with a banking institution or a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”), and, therefore, our bitcoins are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions. As a result, we may suffer a loss with respect to our bitcoins that is not covered by insurance, and we may not be able to recover any of our carried value in these bitcoins if they are lost or stolen or suffer significant and sustained reduction in conversion spot price. If we are not otherwise able to recover damages from a malicious actor in connection with these losses, our business and results of operations may suffer, which may have a material negative impact on our stock price. The limited rights of legal recourse available to us expose us and our investors to the risk of loss of our bitcoins for which no person is liable. At this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative or prosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrency. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations of and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. The sale of our bitcoins to pay for expenses at a time of low bitcoin prices could adversely affect an investment in us. We may sell our bitcoins to pay for expenses on an as-needed basis, irrespective of then-current prices. Consequently, we may sell our bitcoins at a time when bitcoin prices are low, which could adversely affect an investment in us. At this time, we do not mitigate against the potential for decreasing price by engaging in hedging activities related to our bitcoin holdings. See the above risk factor entitled, “The value of bitcoin may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been subject to wide swings. Because we do not currently hedge our investment in bitcoin and do not intend to for the foreseeable future, we may be directly exposed to bitcoin’s price volatility and surrounding risks”. Demand for bitcoin is driven, in part, by its status as a prominent and secure cryptocurrency. It is possible that a cryptocurrency other than bitcoin could have features that make it more desirable to a material portion of the digital asset user base, resulting in a reduction in demand for bitcoins. Bitcoin holds a “first-to-market” advantage over other cryptocurrencies. This first-to-market advantage is driven in large part by having the largest user base and, more importantly, the largest combined mining power in use. Nonetheless, another form of cryptocurrency could become materially popular due to either a perceived or exposed shortcoming of the bitcoin network or a perceived advantage of another form of digital currency. If another form of digital currency obtains significant market share, this could reduce the interest in, and value of, bitcoin and the profitability of our bitcoin operations. Our mining costs may be in excess of our mining revenues, which could seriously harm our business and adversely impact an investment in us. Mining operations are costly and our expenses may increase in the future. Increases in mining expenses may not be offset by corresponding increases in revenue. Our expenses may become greater than we anticipate, and our investments to make our business more cost-efficient may not succeed. Increases in our costs without corresponding increases in our revenue would adversely affect our profitability and could seriously harm our business and an investment in us. The properties included in our mining operation may experience damages, including damages that are not covered by insurance. Our current mining locations and any future sites we establish will be subject to a variety of risks relating to physical condition and operation, including but not limited to: ​ ​ ​ Although our mining sites are equipped with standard security measures normally associated with a traditional data center, our mining sites could still be rendered inoperable, temporarily or permanently, as a result of a fire or other natural disaster or by a terrorist or other events outside of our control. The measures we take to prevent and insure against these risks may not be sufficient or effective. We are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electrical power. The operation of a bitcoin mining facility can require massive amounts of electrical power. Any mining site we currently operate or establish in the future can only be successful if we can continue to obtain sufficient electrical power for that site on a cost-effective basis. To the extent that we establish multiple sites, there may be significant competition for suitable locations, and government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations in times of electricity shortage or may otherwise potentially restrict or prohibit the provision or electricity to mining operations. Additionally, our facilities could be adversely affected by a power outage. Although we maintain limited backup power at certain sites, it would not be feasible to run miners on back-up power generators in the event of a government restriction on electricity or a power outage. To the extent we are unable to receive adequate power supply and are forced to reduce or cease our operations due to the availability or cost of electrical power, our business would be adversely affected. Our operations and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in cryptocurrencies. We compete with other users and/or companies that are mining cryptocurrencies and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed by or linked to cryptocurrencies. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrencies directly, which could limit the market for our shares and reduce their liquidity. The emergence of other financial vehicles and exchange-traded funds have increased scrutiny on cryptocurrencies, and such scrutiny could be applicable to us and impact our ability to successfully establish or maintain a public market for our securities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors. To the extent that the profit margins of bitcoin mining operations are not high, operators of bitcoin mining operations are more likely to immediately sell bitcoin rewards earned by mining in the market, thereby constraining the growth of the price of bitcoin. Bitcoin mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units and first-generation ASIC servers. Currently, new processing power is predominantly added by incorporated and unincorporated professionalized mining operations. Professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. They require the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of this specialized hardware, the leasing of operating space (often in data centers or warehousing facilities), incurring of electricity costs and the employment of technicians to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining operations are of a greater scale than those prior and have more defined and regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized mining operations to maintain profit margins on the sale of bitcoin. To the extent the price of bitcoin declines and such profit margin decreases, professionalized miners will be pressured to immediately sell bitcoin earned from mining operations, whereas it is believed that smaller, individual operations in past years were more likely to hold newly mined bitcoin for lengthier periods. The immediate selling of newly mined bitcoin greatly increases the trading volume of bitcoin, creating downward pressure on the market price of bitcoin. There are risks related to technological obsolescence, the vulnerability of the global supply chain for cryptocurrency hardware disruption, and difficulty in obtaining new hardware which may have a negative effect on our business. Our mining operations can only be successful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including hardware and electricity costs, associated with mining bitcoin are lower than the price of a single bitcoin. As our mining facility operates, our miners experience ordinary wear and tear, and may also face more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors beyond our control. The degradation of our miners will require us to, over time, replace those miners which are no longer functional. Additionally, as the technology evolves, we may be required to acquire newer models of miners to remain competitive in the market. This upgrading process requires substantial capital investment, and we may face challenges in doing so on a timely and cost-effective basis. Further, the global supply of miners is unpredictable and presently heavily dependent on manufacturers based in China, which was severely affected by the emergence of the COVID-19 coronavirus global pandemic. We currently utilize several types of ASIC miners as part of our mining operation, including Bitmain Antminers, Avalon miners and MicroBT WhatsMiners, which are all produced in China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Geopolitical matters, including the U.S. relationship with China, may impact our ability to import ASIC miners. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate replacement parts for our existing miners or obtain additional miners from manufacturers on a timely basis. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors. There is a possibility of bitcoin mining algorithms transitioning to proof of stake validation and other mining related risks, which could make us less competitive and ultimately adversely affect our business and an investment in us. Proof of stake is an alternative method in validating cryptocurrency transactions. Should the bitcoin mining algorithm shift from a proof of work validation method to a proof of stake method, mining would require less energy and may render any company that maintains advantages in the current climate (for example, from lower priced electricity, processing, real estate, or hosting) less competitive. As a result of our efforts to optimize and improve the efficiency of our bitcoin mining operations, we may be exposed to the risk in the future of losing the benefit of our capital investments and the competitive advantage we hope to gain and may be negatively impacted if a switch to proof of stake validation were to occur. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account. We may face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on not only the price of bitcoin but our ability to mine bitcoin. A disruption of the Internet may adversely affect the mining and use of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. Generally, cryptocurrencies and our business of mining bitcoin is dependent upon the Internet. A significant disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt bitcoin’s network operations until the disruption is resolved and have an adverse effect on the price of bitcoin and our ability to mine bitcoin. Since there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of digital assets, including bitcoin, it is unclear how we will be required to account for transactions involving digital assets. Because there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition and no official guidance has yet been provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC, it is unclear how companies may in the future be required to account for cryptocurrency transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards or interpretation by the SEC could result in changes in our accounting treatment and the necessity to restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could adversely impact the accounting for the bitcoins we hold and bitcoin transactions and, more generally, negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Future developments regarding the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax purposes could adversely impact our business. Due to the new and evolving nature of digital assets and the absence of comprehensive legal guidance with respect to digital assets and related transactions, many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax treatment of transactions involving digital assets, such as the purchase and sale of bitcoin and the receipt of staking rewards and other digital asset incentives and rewards products, are uncertain, and it is unclear what guidance may be issued in the future with respect to the tax treatment of digital assets and related transactions. Current IRS guidance indicates that for U.S. federal income tax purposes digital assets such as bitcoins should be treated and taxed as property, and that transactions involving the payment of bitcoins for goods and services should be treated in effect as barter transactions. The IRS has also released guidance to the effect that, under certain circumstances, hard forks of digital currencies are taxable events giving rise to taxable income and guidance with respect to the determination of the tax basis of digital currency. However, current IRS guidance does not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets and related transactions. Moreover, although current IRS guidance addresses the treatment of certain forks, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of income inclusions for various crypto asset transactions, including, but not limited to, staking rewards and other crypto asset incentives and rewards products. While current IRS guidance creates a potential tax reporting requirement for any circumstance where the ownership of a bitcoin passes from one person to another, it preserves the right to apply capital gains treatment to those transactions, which is generally favorable for investors in bitcoin. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not alter its existing position with respect to digital assets in the future or that other state, local and non-U.S. taxing authorities or courts will follow the approach of the IRS with respect to the treatment of digital assets such as bitcoins for income tax and sales tax purposes. Any such alteration of existing guidance or issuance of new or different guidance may have negative consequences including the imposition of a greater tax burden on investors in bitcoin or imposing a greater cost on the acquisition and disposition of bitcoin, generally; in either case potentially having a negative effect on the trading price of bitcoin or otherwise negatively impacting our business. In addition, future technological and operational developments that may arise with respect to digital currencies may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital currencies for U.S. federal income and applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax purposes. Risks Related to Our Securities The price of our common stock may be volatile and could fluctuate widely, which could result in substantial losses for investors. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have the right to designate and issue additional shares of preferred stock. If we were to designate and/or issue additional preferred stock, it is likely to have rights, preferences and privileges that may adversely affect the common stock. We are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of blank- check Preferred Stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix for any series the dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights, and other rights, preferences and privileges for the Preferred Stock. Currently, 2,000,000 shares are designated as Series A Preferred Stock, of which 1,750,000 shares are outstanding, the features of which are discussed elsewhere in this Annual R eport. The issuance of shares of Preferred Stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the Preferred Stock, could reduce the voting rights and powers of the common stock and the portion of our assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution in the book value per share of the common stock . The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, to the detriment of the investors in the common stock offered hereby. We cannot assure that we will not, under certain circumstances, issue shares of our Preferred Stock. We have not paid dividends on shares of our common stock in the past and have no immediate plans to pay do so in the future. We have not paid, and do not plan to pay, any cash dividends with respect to our common stock in the immediate future. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to market our products and to cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We cannot assure stockholders that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, stockholders should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock. If securities or industry analysts do not publish or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us now or in the future issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions. Members of our Board of Directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws as authorized by the Nevada Revised Statutes. Specifically, Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a director or officer is not individually liable to the company or its shareholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer unless it is proven that (1) the directors or officers act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and (2) his or her breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This provision is intended to afford directors and officers protection against and to limit their potential liability for monetary damages resulting from suits alleging a breach of the duty of care by a director or officer. Accordingly, stockholders may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their fiduciary duty of care. In addition, our Bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if one were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses they incurred in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.

Repurchases The Company has not made any repurchases of shares or other units of any class of the Company’s equity securities during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report. Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as anticipate, estimate, plan, project, continuing, ongoing, expect, believe, intend, may, will, should, could, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Results of Operations for the Year Ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 Revenues We earned $49,438,115 in revenues during the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared with $10,028,701 in revenues for the year ended September 30, 2020. For the year ended September 30, 2021, our revenue was derived from cryptocurrency mining revenues, the sale of equipment, solar panels, batteries, design, engineering, and services revenue. Income from our mining segment is a result of bitcoin mining activities in the United States. Income from our Energy segment is the result of contracts to sell switchgear equipment, perform engineering design, and provide software for distributed energy and microgrid systems. For the year ended September 30, 2021, we also generated services revenue from p2kLabs. We hope to generate more significant revenue from customers through the sale and licensing of our Software platforms and services in the future. However, we are unable to estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of future revenues, from existing or future software contracts. Also, we do not anticipate earning significant revenues from our Gasifier business until such time that we have fully developed our technology and are able to market our products. Costs and Expenses We had costs and expenses of $78,015,168 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared with $25,171,817 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Our cost of revenues were $13,964,711 for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared with cost of revenues of $7,907,849 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Our cost of revenues in 2021 was mainly the result of mining energy costs, hosting fees, contract manufacturing expenses, and hardware materials.

Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, CleanSpark management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing the Company with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time. The Company's adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as other companies in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. The Company's adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Our management does not consider adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. We are providing supplemental financial measures for (i) non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or (“adjusted EBITDA”) that excludes the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, our share-based compensation expense, and impairment of assets, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items, certain non-recurring expenses, and impacts related to discontinued operations; and (ii) non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share that excludes the impact of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, our share-based compensation expense, and impairment of assets, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items, and impacts related to discontinued operations. These supplemental financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and, as a result, these supplemental financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to help understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and to help make operating decisions. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. The first supplemental financial measure excludes (i) impacts of interest, taxes, and depreciation; (ii) significant non-cash expenses such as our share-based compensation expense, unrealized gains/losses on securities, certain financing costs, other non-cash items that we believe are not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) significant impairment losses related to long-lived and digital assets, which include our bitcoin for which the accounting requires significant estimates and judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; and (iv) and impacts related to discontinued operations that would not be applicable to our future business activities. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from the first two non-GAAP financial measures, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, and directors. We have also excluded impairment losses on assets, including impairments of our digital currency our non-GAAP financial measures, which may continue to occur in future periods as a result of our continued holdings of significant amounts of bitcoin. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We rely primarily on such Consolidated Financial Statements to understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. The following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP, which excludes the impact of (i) interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization; (ii) our share-based compensation expense; (iii) impairment expense; (iv) unrealized gains/losses on securities; (v) and (vi) impacts related to discontinued operations, to its most directly comparable GAAP measures for the periods indicated: The following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA earnings per share, in each case excluding the impact of (i) interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization; (ii) our share-based compensation expense; (iii) impairment expense; (iv) unrealized gains/losses on securities; (v) certain financing costs and other non-cash items; (vi) certain non-recurring expenses; and (vii) impacts related to discontinued operations: The following is a reconciliation of fair market value of our digital currency holdings to the current carrying value at September 30, 2021. We did not hold any digital currency as of September 30, 2020: (1) Value per coin is the average book value per coin determined by the number of coins held as of the balance sheet date divided by the carrying value. (2) Value per coin is the quoted market price as of the balance sheet date. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year ended September 30, 2021, our primary sources of liquidity came from existing cash and proceeds from share offerings. On March 18, 2021, the Company consummated a fully underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock, which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $187,200,000. On June 3, 2021, the Company entered into an At the Market Offering Agreement (the “ATM”) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (“HCW”), pursuant to which it may, from time to time, offer and sell up to an aggregate of $500,000,000 of shares of its common stock to or through HCW. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,443,379 shares of the Company’s common stock under the ATM for net proceeds of $46.4 million. The shares were sold pursuant to a prospectus dated March 15, 2021 and a prospectus supplement dated June 3, 2021 filed with the SEC. Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that existing cash, cash generated from operations and our ATM will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements until we reach profitability, and we are not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in a decrease in liquidity of our assets. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing, the timing of new product introductions and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may open a revolving line of credit with a bank, or we may have to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities. In the event such financing is needed in the future, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us, or, if available, that it will be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. If cash flows from operations became insufficient to continue operations at the current level, and if no additional financing was obtained, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. As of September 30, 2021, we had total current assets of $57,726,321, consisting of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, digital currency, investments, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and total assets in the amount of $317,473,121. Our total current liabilities as of September 30, 2021 were $10,063,022. We had a working capital surplus of $47,663,299 as of September 30, 2021. Operating activities used $35,429,342 in cash for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared with $6,642,734 for the same period ended September 30, 2020. Our net loss of $21,812,010 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2021, offset mainly by stock-based compensation of $8,546,712, impairment expense of $12,885,786 and depreciation and amortization of $12,244,368. Our net loss of $23,346,143 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2020, offset mainly by amortization of debt discount of $9,010,547, depreciation and amortization of $2,672,331, shares issued as interest of $2,050,000, amortization of capitalized software of $163,918 and stock-based compensation of $2,053,232. Cash flows used by investing activities during the year ended September 30, 2021 was $217,714,926, as compared with $2,383,623 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Our acquisitions of Solar watt Solutions for $1,000,136, purchase of fixed assets of $139,234,948, and deposits on mining equipment of $87,959,910 were the main components of our negative investing cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2021. The negative cash flow from investing activities is offset by sale of digital currencies of $11,443,132, acquisition of ATL Data Center, net of cash received of $45,783 and sale of equity securities of $373,121. For the year ended September 30, 2020, our investment in the capitalized software of $84,924, acquisition of P2K Labs of $1,141,990, acquisition of Grid Fabric of $371,812, purchase of fixed assets of $34,897, and investment in equity and debt security of $750,000 were the main components of our negative investing cash flow. Cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2021 amounted to $268,058,393, as compared with $4,313,702 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Our positive cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 consisted of $270,656,118 in proceeds from offerings, $3,750,932 in proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options offset by repayments of $5,882,553 on promissory notes and $288,602 in finance leases. Our positive cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2020 consisted of $4,000,000 in proceeds from the sale of common stock, $531,169 in proceeds from promissory notes offset by repayments of $217,467 on promissory notes. Contractual Obligations The Company has purchase commitments for approximately $203.6 million related to purchase of miners as of September 30, 2021, and the Company has paid $144.7 million towards these commitments as of the end of this period. The Company has purchase commitments for infrastructure assets and other mining equipment of approximately $6,512,000 as of September 30, 2021 and the Company has paid $4,576,000 towards these commitments during this period. The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments towards our agreements as of September 30, 2021: Contingent consideration GridFabric: On August 31, 2020, the Company acquired GridFabric, LLC. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, additional shares of the Company’s common stock valued at up to $750,000 were issuable if GridFabric achieves certain revenue and product release milestones. On September 30, 2021, the contingent consideration was re-measured to $500,000. Subsequent to September 30, 2021, the Company settled all contingent consideration due to GridFabric resulting in the issuance of 8,404 shares of Company common stock valued at $150,000. Solar Watt Solutions: On February 24, 2021, the Company acquired Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, additional cash consideration of up to $2,500,000 and up to 310,018 shares of the Company’s common stock may be payable if Solar Watt Solutions achieves certain revenue milestones. As of September 30 2021, none of the contingent consideration had been earned. Known Trends or Uncertainties Although we have not seen any significant reduction in revenues to date, we have seen some consolidation in our industry during economic downturns. These consolidations have not had a negative effect on our total sales; however, should consolidations and downsizing in the industry continue to occur, those events could adversely impact our revenues and earnings going forward. As discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the world has been affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Until the pandemic has passed, there remains uncertainty as to the effect of COVID-19 on our business in both the short and long-term. We believe that the need for improved productivity in the research and development activities directed toward developing new products and/or software will continue to result in increasing adoption of energy solution tools such as those we produce. New product and/or software developments in the energy business segment could result in increased revenues and earnings if they are accepted by our markets; however, there can be no assurances that new products and/or software will result in significant improvements to revenues or earnings. For competitive reasons, we do not disclose all of our new product development activities. Our continued quest for acquisitions could result in a significant change to revenues and earnings if one or more such acquisitions are completed. The potential for growth in new markets is uncertain. We will continue to explore these opportunities until such time as we either generate sales or determine that resources would be more efficiently used elsewhere. Inflation We have not been affected materially by inflation during the periods presented, and no material effect is expected in the near future. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. This new guidance is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning February 1, 2023 and interim periods within that fiscal year, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating its potential impact but does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows . In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, “Topic 848”). Topic 848 became effective immediately and expires on December 21, 2022. Topic 848 allows eligible contracts that are modified to be accounted for as a continuation of those contracts, permits companies to preserve their hedging accounting during the transition period and enables companies to make a one-time election to transfer or sell held-to-maturity debt securities that are affected by rate reform. Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on October 1, 2020 (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model that reflects expected credit losses, including credit losses related to trade receivables, and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates, which generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. As the Company was a Smaller Reporting Company at the time of issuance of the ASU, the Company expects to adopt the ASU effective October 1, 2023, including the interim periods within the fiscal year. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),” which reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments will be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net income per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. The treasury stock method should no longer be used to calculate diluted net income per share for convertible instruments. The amendment will be effective for the Company with annual periods beginning January 1, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures. In August 2020, the FASB issued Account Standard Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),” which reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments will be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net income per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. The treasury stock method should no longer be used to calculate diluted net income per share for convertible instruments. The amendment will be effective for the Company with annual periods beginning January 1, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures. The Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a Company’s financial condition and results, and requires managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in the footnotes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021 however we consider our critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition, long-lived assets, accounts receivable, fair value of financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, digital currency and stock-based compensation. Our significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company’s goodwill and digital currency impairment, intangible assets acquired, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, revenue recognition from digital currency mining, valuation of derivative assets and liabilities, available-for-sale investments, allowances for uncollectible accounts, valuation of digital currencies, valuation of contingent consideration, warranty, and the valuations of share based awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions including, but not limited to, the ultimate impact that COVID-19 may have on the Company’s operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2021, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a first time large accelerated filer, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item until the first quarter after the fiscal year in which it is first determined that we have become a large accelerated filer. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Index to Financial Statements Required by Article 8 of Regulation S-X: Audited Consolidated Financial Statements: REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of CleanSpark, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CleanSpark, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated December 14, 2021 expressed an adverse opinion. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that responds to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Evaluation of the Accounting for and Disclosure of Digital Currency Held As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s digital currency held as of September 30, 2021, which mainly consist of Bitcoin, are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, and have been included in current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s digital currency as of September 30, 2021 amounted to approximately $23,603,000. We identified the accounting for and disclosure of the digital currency held as a critical audit matter because, currently, no specific definitive guidance exists for the accounting for and disclosure of digital currencies held in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company’s management has exercised significant judgment in their determination of how existing GAAP should be applied to the accounting for its digital currency held, the associated financial statement presentation and accompanying footnote disclosures. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: Evaluation of the Accounting for and Disclosure of Digital Currency Mining Revenue Recognized As disclosed in Note 2, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company provides computing power to the mining pools and in exchange for providing such computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the pool operator receives for successfully adding a block to the blockchain, plus a fractional share of the transaction fees attached to that block. The Company’s fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized net digital currency mining revenue of approximately $38,846,000. We identified the accounting for and disclosure of digital currency mining revenue recognized as a critical audit matter because, currently, no specific definitive guidance exists for the accounting for and disclosure of digital currency mining revenue recognized in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s management has exercised significant judgment in their determination of how existing GAAP should be applied to the accounting for and disclosure of digital currency mining revenue recognized. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: /s/ MaloneBailey, LLP www.malonebailey.com We have served as the Company's auditor since 2018. Houston, Texas December 14, 2021 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of CleanSpark, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of CleanSpark, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of September 30, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the Company after the date of management’s assessment. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 and for the years then ended and our report dated December 14, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. The Company acquired ATL Data Centers LLC and Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. (collectively, the “Acquired Businesses”) during the year ended September 30, 2021, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, the Acquired Businesses’ internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $267.3 million (of which $27.3 million represents goodwill and intangibles included within the scope of the assessment), and total revenues of $43.2 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Acquired Businesses. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (“Management’s Report”). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s assessment: (1) the Company did not adequately implement or properly maintain controls over its financial close and reporting process, its process over the recording of energy and other services revenue and its process over the accounting and valuation of certain aspects of business combinations involving significant estimates and (2) the Company did not adequately design and maintain effective general information technology controls over third-party information systems and applications that are relevant to the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2021 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report on those financial statements. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ MaloneBailey, LLP www.malonebailey.com We have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Liquidity The accompanying audited financial statements of the Company have been prepared by the Management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and have been filed with the SEC on December 14, 2021 (“Form 10-K”). As shown in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $ 21,812,010 and $ 23,346,143 during the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. While the Company has experienced negative cash flows from operations, the Company has sufficient capital to support its ongoing operations from cash flows provided from operational activities, including potential sale of digital currency, and has access to additional capital through the registered sale of equity securities pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. In addition, the Company is continuing to grow its business segments through which it expects to grow its working capital base. As of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company had working capital of $ 47,663,299 and $ 2,869,329 , respectively. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CleanSpark, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, CleanSpark, LLC, CleanSpark II, LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems Inc., p2kLabs, Inc, GridFabric, LLC, ATL Data Centers LLC, CleanBlok, Inc., CSRE Properties, LLC, Solar Watt Solutions, Inc, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC and CSRE Property Management Company, LLC. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue in operation one year after the date these financial statements are issued and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The evaluation of going concern under the accounting guidance requires significant judgment which involves the Company to consider that it has historically incurred losses in recent years as it has prepared to grow its business through acquisition opportunities. The Company must also consider its current liquidity as well as future market and economic conditions that may be deemed outside the control of the Company as it relates to obtaining financing and generating future profits. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $ 18 million of available cash on-hand and Bitcoin with a fair market value of $ 27.5 million . In determining whether there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, the Company may consider the effects of any mitigating plans for additional sources of financing. The Company identified additional financing sources it believes are currently available to fund its operations and drive future growth that include (i) the ability to access capital using the at-the-market (“ATM”) equity offering program available to the Company whereby the Company may sell additional shares of its common stock (discussed in Note 11 – Stockholders’ Equity), and (ii) the ability to raise additional financing from other sources. (Refer to Note 11 for further details) Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company’s goodwill and digital currency impairment, intangible assets acquired, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, revenue recognition from digital currency mining, valuation of derivative assets and liabilities, available-for-sale investments, allowances for uncollectible accounts, valuation of digital currencies, valuation of contingent consideration, warranty, and the valuations of share based awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions including, but not limited to, the ultimate impact that COVID-19 may have on the Company’s operations. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the Financial Accounting Standard Board's (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, which requires that five steps be followed in evaluating revenue recognition: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identity the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfied a performance obligation. Our accounting policy on revenue recognition by type of revenue is provided below. Revenues from digital currency mining The Company has entered in digital asset mining pools to provide computing power to the mining pools. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and the Company’s enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company starts providing computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives ( less net digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain, , plus a fractional share of the transaction fees attached to that block.. The Company’s fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm. The transaction consideration the Company receives is noncash consideration, in the form of digital currency, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or time the Company has earned the award from the mining pools. The consideration is dependent on the number of digital assets mined on any given day. Fair value of the digital currency award received is determined using the spot price of the related digital currency on the date earned. There is currently no definitive guidance under GAAP or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for digital currencies recognized as revenue or held, and management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the FASB, the Company may be required to change its policies, which could have an effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results from operations. The total revenue recognized from digital currency mining for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is $ 38,846,633 and $0, respectively. Engineering & Construction Contracts and Service Contracts The Company recognizes engineering and construction contract revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer. Engineering and construction contracts are generally accounted for as a single unit of account (a single performance obligation) and are not segmented between types of services. The Company recognizes revenue based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost (an input method). The input method is the most faithful depiction of the Company’s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer. Customer-furnished materials, labor and equipment and, in certain cases, subcontractor materials, labor and equipment, are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent (i.e., the company integrates the materials, labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer). Customer-furnished materials are only included in revenue and cost when the contract includes construction activity and the Company has visibility into the amount the customer is paying for the materials or there is a reasonable basis for estimating the amount. The Company recognizes revenue, but not profit, on certain uninstalled materials that are not specifically produced, fabricated, or constructed for a project. Revenue on these uninstalled materials is recognized when the cost is incurred (when control is transferred). Changes to total estimated contract cost or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level. Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred unless they are expected to be recovered from the client. Project mobilization costs are generally charged to project costs as incurred when they are an integrated part of the performance obligation being transferred to the client. Customer payments on engineering and construction contracts are typically due within 30 to 45 days of billing, depending on the contract. The Company recognizes energy (solar panel and battery) installation contract revenue for residential customers at a point in time upon completion of the installation. The revenues associated with energy installations for commercial customers are recognized over a period of time as noted in the engineering and construction contract revenue disclosure above. For service contracts (including maintenance contracts) in which the Company has the right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date, revenue is recognized when services are performed and contractually billable. Service contracts that include multiple performance obligations are segmented between types of services. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. Revenue recognized on service contracts that have not been billed to clients is classified as a current asset under contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized on service contracts to date are classified as a current liability under contract liabilities. Customer payments on service contracts are typically due within 30 days of billing, depending on the contract. The total revenue recognized from sale of residential battery, residential solar and commercial solar for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is $ 3,727,335 and $ 0 , respectively. Revenues from Sale of Equipment Performance Obligations Satisfied at a point in time. We recognize revenue on agreements for equipment we sell on a standardized basis to the market at a point in time. We recognize revenue at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is generally upon shipment or when the customer has physical possession of the product depending on contract terms. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (i.e., time between shipment and delivery). Generally, shipping costs are included in the price of equipment unless the customer requests a non-standard shipment. In situations where an alternative shipment arrangement has been made, the Company recognizes the shipping revenue upon customer receipt of the shipment. In situations where arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the goods and that acceptance is likely to occur. We generally do not provide for anticipated losses on point in time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer. Our billing terms for these point in time equipment contracts vary and generally coincide with shipment to the customer; however, within certain businesses, we receive progress payments from customers for large equipment purchases, which is generally to reserve production slots with our manufacturing partners, which are recorded as contract liabilities. Due to the customized nature of the equipment, the Company does not allow for customer returns. Service Performance obligations satisfied over time. We enter into long-term product service agreements with our customers primarily within our microgrid segment. These agreements require us to provide preventative maintenance, and standby support services that include certain levels of assurance regarding system performance throughout the contract periods, these contracts will generally range from 1 to 10 years. We account for items that are integral to the maintenance of the equipment as part of our service-related performance obligation, unless the customer has a substantive right to make a separate purchasing decision (e.g., equipment upgrade). Contract modifications that extend or revise contract terms are not uncommon and generally result in our recognizing the impact of the revised terms prospectively over the remaining life of the modified contract (i.e., effectively like a new contract). Revenues are recognized for these arrangements on a straight-line basis consistent with the nature, timing and extent of our services, which primarily relate to routine maintenance and as needed product repairs. Our billing terms for these contracts vary, but we generally invoice periodically as services are provided. Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed and include unbilled receivables (typically for cost reimbursable contracts) of $ 0 and contract work in progress (typically for fixed-price contracts) of $ 0 and $ 4,103 as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. Unbilled receivables, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time, are reclassified to accounts receivable when they are billed under the terms of the contract. There are no advances that are payments on account of contract assets that have been deducted from contract assets as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020. Contract liabilities mostly represent customer deposits. The Company recorded $ 296,964 and $ 64,198 in contract liabilities as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. The total revenue recognized from sale of switchgear for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is $ 4,448,726 and $ 7,505,761 respectively. Revenues from software The Company derives its software revenue from both subscription fees from customers for access to its energy software offerings and software license sales and support services. Revenues from software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer and revenues from the related support is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. The Company’s policy is to exclude sales and other indirect taxes when measuring the transaction price of its subscription agreements. The Company’s subscription agreements generally have monthly or annual contractual terms. Revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term beginning on the date that the platform is made available to a customer. Access to the platform represents a series of distinct services as the Company continually provides access to, and fulfills its obligation to the end customer over the subscription term. The series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time. The total revenue recognized from design, software development and other technology-based consulting services for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is $ 1,676,505 and $ 2,431,419 , respectively. Revenues from design, software development and other technology-based consulting services For service contracts performed under Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) and accompanying Statement(s) of Work (“SOW”), revenue is recognized based on the performance obligation(s) outlined in the SOW which is typically hours worked or specific deliverable milestones. In the case of a milestone-based SOW, the Company recognizes revenues as each deliverable is signed off by the customer. The total revenue recognized from design, software development and other technology-based consulting services for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is $ 1,676,505 and $ 2,431,419 , respectively. Revenues from data center services The Company provides data services such as providing its customers with rack space, power and equipment, and cloud services such as virtual services, virtual storage, and data backup services, generally based on monthly services provided at a defined price included in the contracts. The performance obligations are the services provided to a customer for the month based on the contract. The transaction price is the price agreed with the customer for the monthly services provided and the revenues are recognized monthly based on the services rendered for the month. The total revenue recognized from data center services for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 is $ 554,345 and $ 0 , respectively. Variable Consideration The nature of the Company’s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims and unpriced change orders; awards and incentive fees; and liquidated damages and penalties. The Company recognizes revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value (i.e., the sum of a probability-weighted amount) or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount. Factors considered in determining whether revenue associated with claims (including change orders in dispute and unapproved change orders in regard to both scope and price) should be recognized include the following: (a) the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim, (b) additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and not the result of deficiencies in the company’s performance, (c) claim-related costs are identifiable and considered reasonable in view of the work performed, and (d) evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable. If the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met, revenue is recorded only when the costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred. Back charges to suppliers or subcontractors are recognized as a reduction of cost when it is determined that recovery of such cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated. Disputed back charges are recognized when the same requirements described above for claims accounting have been satisfied. The C ompany generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its engineering and construction contracts. The warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of the Company’s work on a project. Historically, warranty claims have not resulted in material costs incurred. Practical Expedients If the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Company’s performance completed to date (a service contract in which the company bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), the Company recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice for services performed. The Company does not adjust the contract price for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the company transfers a service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service will be one year or less. The Company has made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are collected by the Company from its customers (use taxes, value added taxes, some excise taxes). For the year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company reported revenues of $ 49,438,115 and $ 10,028,701 , respectively. Cost of Revenues The Company includes the following in cost of revenues: energy costs, materials costs, manufacturing and logistics costs, freight costs, inventory write-downs, hosting services costs. The recognition of cost of revenue for our energy segment is dependent upon the revenue stream that it pertains to, refer below: Cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash Cash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks and restricted cash. The Company’s restricted cash represents amounts held in trust for certain construction projects. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported in the consolidated balance sheets that agrees to the total of those amounts as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable is comprised of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms. They are initially recorded at the invoiced amount upon the sale of goods or services to customers, and do not bear interest. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and management closely monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reviewed periodically for collectability. If management determines that collection is unlikely, an allowance that reflects management’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected is recorded. Accounts receivable, net consists of the following: Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower cost or net realizable value with cost being measured on a first-in, first-out basis. For solar panel and battery installations, the Company transfers component parts from inventories to cost of goods sold once installation is complete. The Company periodically reviews inventories for unusable and obsolete items based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Based on this evaluation, provisions are made to write inventories down to their net realizable value. There were no write-downs of inventory as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The composition of inventory for the years ended as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: The Company has presented inventory amounting to $ 247,500 separate from Prepaid and other current assets to Inventory as of September 30, 2020. Prepaid expense and other current assets The Company records a prepaid expense for costs paid but not yet incurred. Those expected to be incurred within one year are recognized and shown as a short-term pre-paid expense. Any costs expected to be incurred outside of one year would be considered other long term assets. Other current assets are assets that consist of deposits and interest receivable. Deposits and interest we expect to receive within one year are shown as short-term. Those we expect to receive outside of one year are shown as other long term assets. Investment securities Investment securities include debt securities and equity securities. Debt securities are classified as available for sale (“AFS”) and are reported as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their estimated fair value. As the fair values of AFS debt securities change, the changes are reported net of income tax as an element of OCI, except for other-than-temporarily-impaired securities. When AFS debt securities are sold, the unrealized gains or losses are reclassified from OCI to non-interest income. Securities classified as AFS are securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sell a security classified as AFS would be based on various factors, including significant movements in interest rates, changes in the maturity mix of the Company’s assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, decline in credit quality, and regulatory capital considerations. Interest income is recognized based on the coupon rate and increased by accretion of discounts earned or decreased by the amortization of premiums paid over the contractual life of the security. For individual debt securities where the Company either intends to sell the security or more likely than not will not recover all of its amortized cost, OTTI (other than temporary impairment) is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. For individual debt securities for which a credit loss has been recognized in earnings, interest accruals and amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts are suspended when the credit loss is recognized. Interest received after accruals have been suspended is recognized in income on a cash basis. The Company holds investments in both publicly held and privately held equity securities. However, as described in Note 1, the Company is primarily doing business of in the digital currency mining sector and alternative energy sector, and not in the business of investing in securities. Privately held equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment. All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized or unrealized, are recorded through gains or losses on equity securities on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Publicly held equity securities are based on fair value accounting with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as unrealized gains or losses on equity securities in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Concentration Risk At times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of FDIC limits. The cash balance, in excess of the FDIC limits was $ 17,790,327 and $ 2,876,202 for periods ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. The accounts offered by custodians of the Company’s bitcoin are not insured by the FDIC. The fair market value of bitcoin held in accounts covered by FDIC limits was $ 27,554,031 and $ 0 for the periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in these accounts. The Company has certain customers and vendors who individually represented 10% or more of the Company’s revenue or capital expenditures. (see Note 16 for details) Leases In accordance with ASC 842, the Company assesses whether an arrangement contains a lease at contract inception. When an arrangement contains a lease, the Company categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in “Fixed Assets, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases. The Company records right-of use (""ROU"") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments. Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Some leases include multiple year renewal options. The Company’s decision to exercise these renewal options is based on an assessment of its current business needs and market factors at the time of the renewal. Currently, the Company has no leases for which the option to renew is reasonably certain and therefore, options to renew were not factored into the calculation of its right of use asset and lease liability as of September 30, 2021. For all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. Warranty Liability The Company establishes warranty liability reserves to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of installation and product defects, product recalls and litigation incidental to the Company’s business. Liability estimates are determined based on management’s judgment, considering such factors as historical experience, the likely current cost of corrective action, manufacturers and subcontractors participation in sharing the cost of corrective action, consultations with third party experts such as engineers, and discussions with the Company’s general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases. The Company’s manufacturers and service providers currently provide substantial warranties between ten to twenty-five years with full reimbursement to replace and install replacement parts. While it is probable that the Company will incur costs associated with future warranty claims, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the loss of future warranty claims. Thus, the loss on warranty claims will be charged to the income of the period in which the loss can be reasonably estimated and shall not be charged retroactively to an earlier period, in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450. There were no warranty costs and associated liabilities as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020. Stock -based compensation The Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10 Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company may issue compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management, accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services. The Company determines the grant date fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For discussion of accounting for RSUs, please refer Note 13 – Stock-Based Compensation. Earnings (loss) per share The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10 “Earnings Per Share,” which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, there were 2,173,578 shares and 1,577,013 shares, respectively, issuable upon exercise of outstanding options warrants and restricted stock units, as well as 5,250,000 shares issuable upon preferred stock conversions, that were excluded from the current and prior period calculations of diluted net loss per share as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to the Company’s net loss. Property and equipment In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 360-10, ""Property, Plant and Equipment” the carrying value of property and equipment, and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. During the year ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 the Company did not record an impairment expense. Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Construction in progress is the construction or development of assets that has not yet been placed in service for its intended use. Depreciation for machinery and equipment, mining equipment, buildings, furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for its intended use. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Business combinations, Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combi nations, where the total purchase price is allocated to the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The difference between the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration transferred is initially recognized at fair value. Contingent consideration classified as a liability or an asset is remeasured to fair value each period until settlement, with changes recognized in profit or loss. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured. Acquisition-related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred . The Company reviews its indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In accordance with its policies, the Company performed an assessment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill as of the year end September 30, 2021. (See Note 6 for impairment related to indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill). 2021 Goodwill Impairment analysis In completing the 2021 annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company elected to perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments for our goodwill. The assessments involve comparing the carrying value of the entity, including goodwill, to its estimated fair value. In accordance with ASU 2017-04, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. In determining the fair value for which the quantitative assessment was performed, the Company obtained an independent evaluation of goodwill. The independent evaluation agency has utilized the income approach to test for goodwill impairment. The income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. Using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, revenue is projected and applied to fixed and variable cost experience rates to arrive at the future cash flows. A terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream. Future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. The discount rate used was the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. In determining the estimated fair value, several factors were estimated, including projected operating results, growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows and the discount rate. The assessment indicated that impairment of goodwill was necessary. Based on the assessment for impairment, the Company reported an impairment expense of goodwill of $ 5,723,388 for the year ended September 30, 2021. There was no impairment expense for the year ended September 30, 2020. The following table reflects segment wise goodwill activity for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively: 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Segment Wise Goodwill Activity (Details) ( 5,723,388 ) The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives, which range between two and twenty years as follows: Digital Currency Digital currencies are included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Digital currencies are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other, and are accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition policy detailed above and in Footnote 2 – Significant Accounting Policies. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Quantitative impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the digital currency at the time its fair value is being measured in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. Quoted prices are obtained from the principal market. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted as per ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. Digital currencies earned by the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The sales of digital currencies are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and any realized gains or losses from such sales are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first in first out (“FIFO”) method of accounting. The following table presents the activities of the digital currencies for the year ended September 30, 2021: Software Development Costs The Company capitalizes software development costs under guidance of ASC 985-20 Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed for our mPulse, Canvas & Plaid platforms and under ASC 350-40 Internal Use Software. Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and infrastructure design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established, and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of ""Product development."" Capitalized costs for products that are cancelled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to ""Product development"" in the period of cancellation. Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to ""Cost of revenues software amortization"" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of seven years for our current product offerings. In recognition of the uncertainties involved in estimating future revenue, amortization will never be less than straight-line amortization of the products remaining estimated economic life. We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior periods, the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the software platform to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable software; orders for the product prior to its release; pending contracts and general market conditions. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations. If an impairment occurs the reduced amount of the capitalized software costs that have been written down to the net realizable value at the close of each annual fiscal period will be considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. Fair Value Measurement of financial instruments, derivative asset and contingent consideration The carrying value of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and debt approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices included for identical or similar assets and liabilities that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. These are typically obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments. The following table presents the Company’s financial instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s balance sheets on a recurring basis, and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020: September 30, 2021: September 30, 2020: Income taxes The Company’s calculation of its tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. The Company recognizes tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on management’s estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes will be required. The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2021 and 2020. Deferred income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Temporary differences arise from net operating losses, differences in depreciation methods of archived images, and property and equipment, stock-based and other compensation, and other accrued expenses. A valuation allowance is established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S., or the various state jurisdictions, may be materially different from managements estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. Interest and penalties are included in tax expense. The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operation in the provision for income taxes. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations or net assets of the Company and are as follows: Commitments and contingencies The Company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies and loss recoveries, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business. The Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as the Company’s ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly evaluates current information available with its external and internal counsel to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed. Segment Reporting Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding the method to allocate resources and assess performance. To better align with the Company’s strategic objectives, the Company optimized its reportable segments down to two, (1) Digital Currency Mining Segment and (2) Energy Segment; by eliminating the digital agency segment. Results associated with that component are now being reported under other revenue and eliminations. Recently issued accounting pronouncements In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. This new guidance is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning February 1, 2023 and interim periods within that fiscal year, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating its potential impact but does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, “Topic 848”). Topic 848 became effective immediately and expires on December 21, 2022. Topic 848 allows eligible contracts that are modified to be accounted for as a continuation of those contracts, permits companies to preserve their hedging accounting during the transition period and enables companies to make a one-time election to transfer or sell held-to-maturity debt securities that are affected by rate reform. Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on October 1, 2020 (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model that reflects expected credit losses, including credit losses related to trade receivables, and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates, which generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. As the Company was a Smaller Reporting Company at the time of issuance of the ASU, the Company expects to adopt the ASU effective October 1, 2023, including the interim periods within the fiscal year. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),” which reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments will be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net income per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. The treasury stock method should no longer be used to calculate diluted net income per share for convertible instruments. The amendment will be effective for the Company with annual periods beginning January 1, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures. In August 2020, the FASB issued Account Standard Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (subtopic 815-40),” which reduces the number of accounting models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. As a result, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the effective interest rate of convertible debt instruments will be closer to the coupon interest rate. Further, the diluted net income per share calculation for convertible instruments will require the Company to use the if-converted method. The treasury stock method should no longer be used to calculate diluted net income per share for convertible instruments. The amendment will be effective for the Company with annual periods beginning January 1, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements or disclosures. 3. ACQUISITIONS SOLAR WATT SOLUTIONS, INC. On February 23, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “SWS Merger Agreement”) with Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. (“SWS”) and its owners (the “Sellers”). The Company accounted for the acquisition of SWS as an acquisition of a business under ASC 805 – Business Combination. At the closing on February 24, 2021, SWS became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In exchange, the Company issued (i) 477,703 shares of restricted common stock with a deemed value of $ 15,640,000 calculated based on the five-day average price to the Sellers, of which (a) 167,685 shares with a deemed value of $ 5,490,000 would be fully earned on closing, and (b) an additional 310,018 shares with a deemed fair value of $ 10,150,000 were issued to an escrow agent and only earned by Sellers, subject to holdback pending Sellers’ satisfaction of certain future milestones with all such shares subject to a lock up of no less than 180 days and a leak out of no more than 10% of average daily trading value of the prior 30 days for a period of 36 months following the closing, and (ii) up to $3,850,000 in cash to the Sellers, minus the Sellers’ debt, minus the difference between the Actual Amount and Expected Amount consisting of: (A) $1,350,000 (no changes post acquisition date) in cash payable on a pro rata basis to Sellers at closing, less payment of $500,000 (no changes post acquisition date) to settle Sellers’ debt at closing, which includes (I) $200,000 (no changes post acquisition date) in cash was held back by the Company to satisfy potential damages from indemnification claims and any amounts owed pursuant to post-closing adjustments, (II) an additional $100,000 (no changes post acquisition date) in cash was held back by the Company to satisfy any amounts owed pursuant to post-closing adjustments, and (B) up to $2,500,000 (fair valued at $155,000 at acquisition date) in cash held back by the Company and only payable pro rata to Sellers upon meeting certain future milestones and subject to satisfaction of any amounts owing rom SWS to the Company resulting from damages required to be indemnified under the SWS Merger Agreement. The Company determined the fair value of the consideration given to the sellers of SWS in connection with the transaction in accordance with ASC 820 was as follows: The goodwill recorded as result of the acquisition represents the strategic benefits of growing the Company’s service portfolio and the expected revenue growth from increased market penetration. Acquired goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The total purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets deemed acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, the Company determined that the accounting treatment of the contingent consideration as reported in the March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 consolidated financial statements needed to be revised. Specifically, the contingent cash consideration liability recorded at acquisition date of $ 2,500,000 should be adjusted to $ 155,000 due to probability of non-satisfaction of future milestones. As a result, the contingent cash consideration liability recorded at acquisition date of $ 2,500,000 was adjusted to $ 155,000 due to probability of non-satisfaction of future milestones. The Company also estimated that based upon the milestones, only 19,221 contingent shares will be earned out of the 310,018 total contingent shares, and as a result, the Company adjusted the contingent stock consideration to $533,002. The Company assessed the materiality of these adjustments and determined that these were not material to previously issued financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021. The immaterial impacts of these adjustments for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 are as follows: Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (unaudited) Condensed Consolidated Statement of operations (unaudited) The amortization period for customer list is estimated to be 1.5 years. The Company estimated the fair value of the identified customer list using a discounted cash flow model. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected incremental future cash flows over its remaining useful life, and discount rates the Company believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with customer list, which is 14 % . The Company believes the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. The contingent cash consideration was re-measured to $ 320,802 at September 30, 2021. The company estimates the total contingent cash consideration to be between $ 320,000 and $ 550,000 based on the range of possible outcomes. In addition, the Company estimates the total stock consideration to be between $ 1,100,000 and $ 1,900,000 based on the range of possible outcomes. Net sales and net loss of this business included in the Company’s consolidated results of operations in fiscal year 2021 were approximately $ 3,806,007 and $ 811,727 , respectively. ATL DATA CENTERS, LLC On December 9, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “ATL Merger”) with ATL Data Centers LLC (“ATL”) and its members. The Company accounted for the acquisition of ATL as an acquisition of a business under ASC 805 – Business Combination. At the closing, ATL became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In exchange, the Company issued 1,618,285 shares of restricted common stock to the selling members of ATL, of which: (i) 642,309 shares were fully earned on closing, and (ii) an additional 975,976 shares were issued and held in escrow, subject to holdback pending satisfaction of certain indemnification claims and future milestones, with all such shares subject to a lock up of no less than 180 days and a leak out of no more than 10% of the average daily trading value of the prior 30 days. The Company determined the fair value of the consideration given to the sellers of SWS in connection with the transaction in accordance with ASC 820 was as follows: Of the 975,976 shares held in escrow, 515,724 shares were released to the selling members of ATL and 68,194 shares were returned to the Company and canceled due to nonsatisfaction of certain indemnification claims during the year ended September 30, 2021. The remaining 392,058 shares held in escrow consist of 72,989 shares subject to holdback pending satisfaction of further indemnification claims and 319,069 shares subject to satisfaction of future milestones. In connection with the return of the 68,194 shares held in escrow that were cancelled due to the non-satisfaction of certain indemnification claims, total consideration and the related goodwill, decreased by $ 892,659 during the year ended September 30, 2021. The consideration remitted in connection with the ATL Merger is subject to adjustment based on post-closing adjustments to closing cash, indebtedness, and transaction expenses of ATL within 90 days of closing. The Company also assumed approximately $ 6.9 million in debts of ATL at closing. As part of the transaction costs, the Company issued 41,708 shares of common stock for an aggregate value of $ 545,916 to the broker which were expensed upon issuance of the shares. The Company made measurement period adjustments, primarily to strategic contract and goodwill, to better reflect the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition represents the strategic benefits of growing the Company’s service portfolio and the expected revenue growth from increased mcarket penetration. Acquired goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The total purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets deemed acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. The strategic contract relates to supply of a critical input to our digital currency mining business. The other assets and liabilities assumed include $ 5.67 million of digital currency mining equipment and $ 5.475 million of notes payable related to this equipment, which was settled by the Company during the year ended September 30, 2021. In connection with the acquisition, the Company had acquired an operating lease related to a rental building, which had a purchase option associated with the lease agreement. The Company exercised the purchase option to buy the property in May 2021 and, as a result, terminated the lease. The amortization period for strategic contracts is estimated to be 5 years . The Company estimated the fair value of the identified strategic contract using a discounted cash flow model. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions include the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands over its remaining useful life, and discount rates the Company believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with strategic contract, which is 6.4 % . The Company believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions. Net sales and net income of this business included in CleanSpark’s consolidated results of operations in fiscal year 2021 were approximately $ 30,234,683 and $ 14,449,160 , respectively. P2K LABS, INC. On January 31, 2020, the Company, entered into an Agreement with p2k, and its sole stockholder, Amer Tadayon (the “Seller”), whereby the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of p2k in exchange for an aggregate adjusted purchase price of cash and equity of $ 1,688,935 . The transaction closed simultaneously upon the execution of the Agreement by the parties on January 31, 2020. As a result of the transaction, p2k became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the purchase price was as follows: a) $ 1,039,500 in cash was paid to the Seller; b) 31,183 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $ 145,000 , were issued to the Seller (the “Shares”). The Shares are subject to certain lock-up and leakout provisions whereby the Seller may sell an amount of Shares equal to ten percent (10%) of the daily dollar trading volume of the Company’s common stock on its principal market for the prior 30 days (the “Leak-Out Terms”); c) $ 115,500 in cash was paid to an independent third-party escrow where such cash is subject to offset for adjustments to the purchase price and indemnification purposes; d) 64,516 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $ 300,000 , were issued to an independent third-party escrow agent (the “Holdback Shares”) and will be released to the Seller upon achievement of certain revenue milestones. During the year ended September 30, 2021, 56,444 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock were released to the Seller and the balance of 8,072 shares of the Company’s common stock were returned and cancelled. The Holdback Shares are subject to the Leak-Out Terms. The Shares and Holdback Shares were deemed to have a fair market value of $ 4.65 per share, which was the closing price of the Company’s common stock on January 31, 2020; and e) 26,950 common stock options that were deemed to have a fair market value of $ 88,935 on the date of the closing of the transaction. The Company accounted for the acquisition of p2k as an acquisition of a business under ASC 805 – Business Combinations. The Company determined the fair value of the consideration given to the Seller in connection with the transaction in accordance with ASC 820 – Fair Value Measurement was as follows: The total purchase price of the Company’s acquisition of p2k was allocated to identifiable assets deemed acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as indicated below. Net sales and net loss of this business included in the Company’s consolidated results of operations in fiscal year 2021 were approximately $ 1,241,641 and $ 1,201,753 , respectively. GRIDFABRIC, LLC On August 31, 2020, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with GridFabric, and its sole member, Dupont Hale Holdings, LLC (the “Seller”), whereby the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding membership units of GridFabric from the Seller (the “Transaction”) in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of cash and stock of up to $ 1,400,000 (the “Purchase Price”). The Transaction closed simultaneously with execution on August 31, 2020. As a result of the Transaction, GridFabric, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Purchase Price was as follows: The Shares were issued at a fair market value of $9.46 per share. The Earn-Out Shares are accounted for as contingent consideration and the number of shares to be issued will be determined based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date such milestone event occurs. The Agreement contains standard representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification and other terms customary in similar transactions. In connection with the transaction, the Company also entered into employment relationships and non-compete agreements with GridFabric’s key employees for a period of 36 months and plans to issue future equity compensation to said employees, subject to approval of the Company’s board of directors. The Company accounted for the acquisition of GridFabric as an acquisition of a business under ASC 805 – Business Combinations. The Company determined the fair value of the consideration given to the Seller in connection with the Transaction in accordance with ASC 820 – Fair Value Measurement was as follows: During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company reassessed the contingent consideration due to GridFabric to $ 500,000 . A change in the fair value of the contingent consideration of $ 250,000 is included in change in fair value of contingent consideration in Consolidated Statement of Consolidated Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The total purchase price of the Company’s acquisition of GridFabric was allocated to identifiable assets deemed acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as indicated below. Net sales and operating loss of this business included in the Company’s consolidated results of operations in fiscal year 2021 were approximately $ 299,606 and $ 794,805 , respectively. The following is the unaudited pro forma information assuming the acquisition of GridFabric, p2k Labs, ATL, and SWS occurred on October 1, 2019: Weighted average common shares outstanding – basic and diluted The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial results have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that would have actually resulted had the acquisition occurred on the first day of the earliest period presented, or of future results of the consolidated entities. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information does not reflect any operating efficiencies and cost savings that may be realized from the integration of the acquisition. All transactions that would be considered inter-company transactions for proforma purposes have been eliminated. 4. INVESTMENTS As of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company had total investments of $ 5,661,036 and $ 3,075,269 that comprise of the following: International Land Alliance, Inc. On November 5, 2019, the Company entered in a binding Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with International Land Alliance, Inc. (“ILAL”), a Wyoming corporation, to lay a foundational framework where the Company will deploy its energy solutions products and services to ILAL, its energy projects, and its customers. In connection with the MOU, and to support the power and energy needs of ILALs development and construction of certain projects, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”), dated as of November 6, 2019, with ILAL. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA with ILAL, the Company purchased 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of ILAL (the “Preferred Stock”) an aggregate purchase price of $ 500,000 (the “Stock Transaction”), less certain expenses and fees. The Series B Preferred Stock accrue cumulative in-kind accruals at a rate of 12% per annum and were redeemable on August 6, 2020. The Preferred Stock can be converted into common stock at a variable rate (refer the discussion on embedded derivative assets below). This variable conversion ratio will increase by 10% with the occurrence of certain events. Since the investments were not redeemed on August 6, 2020, they are now redeemable at the Company`s option in cash or into common stock, based on the conversion ratio. The Preferred Stock is recorded as an AFS debt security and is reported at its estimated fair value as of September 30, 2021.

INCOME TAXES The Company provides for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. FASB ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently. FASB ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the Company’s opinion, it is uncertain whether they will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset. Accordingly, a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been recorded. The total deferred tax asset is approximately $ 38.8 million as of September 30, 2021 which is calculated by multiplying a 21 % estimated tax rate by the cumulative net operating loss (“NOL”) of approximately $ 184.6 million. Due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 2017, we have calculated our deferred tax assets using an estimated corporate tax rate of 21 % . U.S. Tax codes and laws may be subject to further reform or adjustment which may have a material impact to the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. The significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: As of September 30, 2021, and 2020, the Company had gross federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 184.6 million and $ 52.5 million, respectively. The Company plans to file its U.S. federal return for the year ended September 30, 2021 upon the issuance of this filing. Upon filing of the tax return for the year ended September 30, 2021 the actual deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance available to the Company may differ from managements estimates. The tax years 2015-2019 remained open to examination for federal income tax purposes by the major tax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. No tax returns are currently under examination by any tax authorities. 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company has purchase commitments that are cancellable of approximately $ 144.04 million related to purchase of miners as of September 30, 2021, and the Company has paid $ 85.11 million towards these commitments as of the end of this period. As of September 30, 2021, the remaining commitment for future payments was $ 58.93 million. The Company has purchase commitments for infrastructure assets and other mining equipment of approximately $ 6,512,000 as of September 30, 2021 and the Company has paid $ 4,576,000 towards these commitments as of end of this period. The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments towards our agreements as of September 30, 2021: Contingent consideration GridFabric: On August 31, 2020, the Company acquired GridFabric, LLC. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, additional shares of the Company’s common stock valued at up to $ 750,000 were issuable if GridFabric achieves certain revenue and product release milestones. On September 30, 2021, the contingent consideration was re-measured to $ 500,000 . Subsequent to September 30, 2021, the Company settled all contingent consideration due to GridFabric resulting in a payment of 8,404 shares of common stock valued at $ 150,000 . Solar Watt Solutions: On February 24, 2021, the Company acquired Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, additional cash consideration of up to $ 2,500,000 (fair valued at $ 155,000 at acquisition date) in cash held back by the Company and only payable pro rata to Sellers upon meeting certain future milestones and subject to satisfaction of any amounts owing from SWS to the Company resulting from damages required to be indemnified under the SWS Merger Agreement. The contingent cash consideration was re-measured to $ 320,802 at September 30, 2021. Legal contingencies From time to time we may be subject to litigation. Risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify, and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. We have acquired liability insurance to reduce such risk exposure to the Company. Despite the measures taken, such policies may not cover future litigation, or the damages claimed may exceed our coverage which could result in contingent liabilities. Bishins v. CleanSpark, Inc. et al. On January 20, 2021, Scott Bishins (“Bishins”), individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (together, the “Class”), filed a class action complaint (the “Class Complaint”) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, Zachary Bradford (“Bradford”), and its Chief Financial Officer, Lori Love (“Love”) (the “Class Action”). The Class Complaint alleges that, between December 31, 2020 and January 14, 2021, the Company, Bradford, and Love “failed to disclose to investors: (1) that the Company had overstated its customer and contract figures; (2) that several of the Company’s recent acquisitions involved undisclosed related party transactions; and (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.” (the “Class Allegations”). The Class Complaint seeks: (a) certification of the Class, (b) an award of compensatory damages to the Class, and (c) an award of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Class in the litigation. To date, no class has been certified in the Class Action. Currently, there is a pending motion to appoint lead class plaintiff, at which point dispositive motions may be filed. Although the ultimate outcome of the Class Action cannot be determined with certainty, the Company stands behind all of its prior statements and disclosures and believes that the claims raised in the Class Complaint are entirely without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims. Notwithstanding the Class Allegations’ lack of merit, however, the Class Action may distract the Company and cost the Company’s management time, effort and expense to defend against the claims made in the Class Complaint. Notwithstanding the Company’s belief that the Company and its management have complied with all of their obligations under applicable securities regulations, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the Class Action, and in the event the Company does not prevail in such action, the Company, its business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Ciceri, derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., v. Bradford, Love, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill, and Wood (consolidated with Perna, derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., v. Bradford, Love, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill, and Wood) On May 26, 2021, Andrea Ciceri (“Ciceri”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “Ciceri Derivative Action”) in the United States District Court in the District of Nevada against Chief Executive Officer, Zachary Bradford (“Bradford”), Chief Financial Officer, Lori Love (“Love”) and Directors Matthew Schultz, Roger Beynon, Larry McNeill and Tom Wood (Bradford, Love and Directors collectively referred to as “Defendants.”) On June 22, 2021, Mark Perna (“Perna”) filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “Perna Derivative Action”) in the same Court against the same Defendants making substantially similar allegations. On June 29, 2021, the court consolidated the Ciceri Derivative Action with the Perna Derivative Action in accordance with a stipulation among the parties (the consolidated case referred to as the “Derivative Action”). The Derivative Action alleges that Defendants: (1) made materially false and misleading public statements about the Company’s business and prospects; (2) did not maintain adequate internal controls; and (3) did not disclose several related party transactions benefitting insiders, questionable uses of corporate assets, and excessive compensation. The claims asserted against all Defendants include breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets. A claim for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities and Exchange Act is asserted against only Bradford and Love. The Derivative Action seeks declaratory relief, monetary damages, and imposition of adequate corporate governance and internal controls. Plaintiffs were given the opportunity to submit an Amended Complaint by November 25, 2021, but elected not to. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss will be due by January 20, 2022. Although the ultimate outcome of the Derivative Action cannot be determined with certainty, the Company stands behind all of its prior statements and disclosures, and believes that the claims raised in that case are entirely without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims. Notwithstanding the Derivative Action’s lack of merit, however, it may distract the Company and cost the Company’s management time, effort and expense to defend against the claims. Notwithstanding the Company’s belief that the Company and its management have complied with all of their obligations under applicable securities regulations, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the Derivative Action, and in the event the Company does not prevail in such action, the Company, its business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 16.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report (under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). Based on that assessment, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, as described below. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures is expressed at a level of reasonable assurance because management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). We excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial reporting of ATL Data Centers LLC and Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. with total assets of $267.3 million (of which $27.3 million represents goodwill and intangibles included within the scope of the assessment), and total revenues of $43.2 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021.As part of our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, management identified the following material weaknesses: (1) the Company did not adequately implement or properly maintain controls over its financial close and reporting process, its process over the recording of energy and other services revenue and its process over the accounting and valuation of certain aspects of business combinations involving significant estimates and (2) the Company did not adequately design and maintain effective general information technology controls over third-party information systems and applications that are relevant to the preparation of the Company’s financial statements: A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis These material weaknesses did not result in any identified material misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Based on these material weaknesses, management concluded that at September 30, 2021, internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Our independent registered public accounting firm, MaloneBailey, LLP has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, which appears on page F-2. Following identification of the material weaknesses and prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed substantive procedures for the year ended September 30, 2021. Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our CEO and CFO has certified that, based on their knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of CleanSpark as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-K. MaloneBailey, LLP has issued an unqualified opinion on our financial statements, which appears on page F-1. REMEDIATION Management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include the following: We believe that these actions will remediate the material weaknesses, once management has performed its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting including the remedial measures described above. The weaknesses will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of these material weaknesses will be completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2022. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Except for the material weaknesses identified during the quarter, as of September 30, 2021, and except for the remedial measures described above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Item 9B. Other Information None.

TABLE OF CONTENTS Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2020 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements that are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements (such as when we describe what “will,” “may,” or “should” occur, what we “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “believe,” “expect” or “anticipate” will occur, and other similar statements) include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future operating results, potential risks pertaining to these future operating results, future plans or prospects, anticipated benefits of proposed (or future) acquisitions, dispositions and new facilities, growth, the capabilities and capacities of business operations, any financial or other guidance, expected capital expenditures and all statements that are not based on historical fact, but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events. We make certain assumptions when making forward-looking statements, any of which could prove inaccurate, including assumptions about our future operating results and business plans. Therefore, we can give no assurance that the results implied by these forward-looking statements will be realized.

Business As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company”, “CleanSpark, Inc.” and “CleanSpark” mean CleanSpark, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated. Overview CleanSpark, Inc. is a Nevada corporation. We are in the business of providing advanced software and controls technology solutions to solve modern energy challenges. We have a suite of software solutions that provide end-to-end microgrid energy modeling, energy market communications and energy management solutions. Our offerings consist of intelligent energy monitoring and controls, intelligent microgrid design software, middleware communications protocols for the energy industry, energy system engineering and software consulting services. The software platforms (the “Platforms”) which are integral to our business are summarized as follows: The Platforms are designed to allow customers to design, build, and operate distributed energy systems and microgrids which efficiently manage energy generation assets, energy storage assets, and energy consumption assets. Our software products enable users to implement software solutions to execute on these strategies. These strategies are generally targeted to operate distributed energy assets in a manner that provides resiliency and economic optimization and/or revenue generation through wholesale market activities. We also offer digital agency services through p2kLabs, Inc. including creative design, marketing/digital content, technical development, and engineering. We also own patented gasification technologies. Our technology converts any organic material into SynGas which can be used as fuel for a variety of applications and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether). As previously disclosed, we plan to continue to focus on our other product offerings, as opposed to expending significant efforts on the Gasifier side of the business. Lines of Business Energy Business Segment Through CleanSpark, LLC, the Company provides microgrid engineering, design and software solutions to military, commercial and residential customers. Our services consist of distributed energy microgrid system engineering and design, and project consulting services. Through CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc., the Company provides custom hardware solutions for distributed energy systems that serve military and commercial residential properties. Through GridFabric, LLC the Company provides Open Automated Demand response (“OpenADR”) and other middleware communication protocol software solutions to commercial and utility customers. Digital Agency Segment Through p2kLabs, Inc., the Company provides design, software development and other technology-based consulting services. Distributed Energy Management and Microgrid Industry Integral to our business is our Distributed Energy Management Business (the “DER Business”). The main assets of our DER Business include our propriety software systems (“Systems”) and also our engineering and methodology trade secrets. The Distributed Energy systems and Microgrids that utilize our Systems are capable of providing secure, sustainable energy with significant cost savings for its energy customers. The Systems allows customers to design, engineer, and then efficiently communicate with and manage renewable energy generation, storage and consumption. By having autonomous control over the multiple facets of energy usage and storage, customers are able to reduce their dependency on utilities, thereby keeping energy costs relatively constant over time. The overall aim is to transform energy consumers into intelligent energy producers by supplying and managing power in a manner that anticipates their routine instead of interrupting it. Around the world, the aging grid is becoming unstable and unreliable due to increases in loads and lack of new large-scale generation facilities. This inherent instability is compounded by the push to integrate a growing number and variety of renewable but intermittent energy generation assets and advanced technologies into outdated electrical grid systems. Simultaneously, defense installations, industrial complexes, communities, campuses and other aggregators across the world are turning to virtual power plants and microgrids as a means to decrease their reliance from the grid, reduce utility costs, utilize cleaner power, and enhance energy security and surety. The convergence of these factors is creating significant opportunities in the power supply optimization and energy management industry. Efficiently operating and managing the distributed energy management systems and microgrids of tomorrow, while maximizing the use of sustainable energy to produce affordable, stable, predictable and reliable power on a large scale, is a significant opportunity that early-movers can leverage to capture a large share of this emerging global industry. A microgrid is comprised of any number of energy generation, energy storage, and smart distribution assets that serve a single or multiple loads, both connected to the utility grid and separate from the utility grid “islanded”. In the past, distributed energy management systems and microgrids have consisted of off-grid generators organized with controls to provide power where utility lines cannot run. Today, modern distributed energy management systems and microgrids integrate renewable energy generation systems (REGS) with advanced energy storage devices and interoperate with the local utility grid. Advanced autonomous cyber-secure microgrids controls relay information between intelligent hardware and servers to make decisions in real-time that deliver optimum power where it is needed, when it is needed. Our mPulse software is an integrated distributed energy management control platform that seamlessly integrates and controls all forms of energy generation with energy storage devices to provide energy security in real time free of cyber threats to service facility loads. DER systems are able to interoperate with the local utility grid, and bring users the ability to choose when to buy or sell power to and from the utility grid. mPulse is ideal DER systems for commercial, industrial, defense, campus and residential users and ranges in size from 4KW to 100MW and beyond. mPulse Software Suite mPulse is a modular platform that provides intelligent control of a Microgrid based on a systems operational goals, energy assets and forecasted energy load and generation. mPulse performs high-frequency calculations, threshold-based alarming, execution of domain-specific business rules, internal and external health monitoring, historical data persistence, and system-to-operator notifications. The modular design increases system flexibility and extensibility. In addition, the deployment of the mPulse system follows a security-conscious posture by deploying hardware-based firewalls as well as encryption across communication channels. mPulse allows configuration for site-specific equipment and operation and provides a clean, informative user interface to allow customers to monitor and analyze the data streams that describe how their microgrid is operating. mPulse supports our innovative fractal approach to microgrid design, which enables multiple microgrids on a single site to interact in a number of different ways, including as peers, in a parent-child relationship, and in parallel or completely disconnected. Each grid can have different operational objectives, and those operational objectives can change over time. Any microgrid can be islanded from the rest of the microgrid as well as the larger utility grid. The mPulse software can control the workflow required in both the islanding steps as well as the reconnecting steps of this maneuver and coordinate connected equipment such that connections are only made when it is safe to do so. Microgrid Value Stream Optimizer (mVSO) The Microgrid Value Stream Optimizer (mVSO) software platform provides a robust distributed energy and microgrid system modeling solution. mVSO takes utility rate data and load data for a customer site and helps automate the sizing and analysis of potential microgrid solutions as well as providing a financial analysis around each grid configuration. mVSO uses historical data to generate projected energy performance of generation assets and models how storage responds to varying operational modes and command logics based upon predicted generation and load curves. mVSO analyzes multiple equipment combinations and operational situations to determine the optimal configuration for a site based on the financial and economic results, equipment outlay, utility cost savings, etc., to arrive at payback and IRR values. This ultimately provides the user with data to design a distributed energy and/or microgrid system that will meet the customers’ performance benchmarks. The system also provides users with business development and proposal generation tools to more efficiently present the results to end-customers.

Legacy Gasifier Business Our Gasification technologies and prototype will need to undergo further additional testing to further establish its commercial capability of producing large volumes of clean, renewable energy from any carbon compound (Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Coal, Sewage Sludge) into clean Synthesis Gas(“ SynGas”) . Our prototype Gasifier is still under development and a commercially viable Gasifier is not expected to be sellable until we expend additional resources on its testing and development. A third-party consulting firm has independently tested the Gasifer's performance and certified the results of its performance. Upon completion of the testing, an initial white paper was published outlining the results and suggested improvements for commercialization. We anticipate that the investment to complete these improvements would b e between approximately $500,000. Upon completion of the improvements, we would be required to conduct an extended test run with an independent third party to verify the results needed to prove its commercial viability, at which time we could begin to actively market our Gasifier units. We own Patent Nos. 9,890,340B2, 9,359,567, 8,518,133 8,105,401 and 8,347,829 protecting our gasification technology and process for using feedstock comprising gaseous fuel Our patented process involves the grinding, drying, separating, mixing, and then pelletizing of solid waste. These pellets constitute the feedstock for the Gasifier. Gasifying feedstock using our technology converts waste and organic material into SynGas. SynGas can be converted into multiple forms of fuel for power plants, motor vehicles, jets, duel-fuel diesel engines, gas turbines, and steam boilers and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether). The SynGas produced is mostly hydrogen and carbon monoxide which are primary building blocks for many fuels and chemicals. Syngas is sufficiently clean that it if processed directly it generally does not require costly hot-gas cleanup. As discussed above, we do not anticipate deploying significant resources on the gasification business at this time. As opportunities arise, we intend to utilize the gasification assets and intellectual properties through licensing or sales agreements. We have not engaged in any significant negotiations to sell or license our Gasifier products to any major customers. Markets, Geography and Major Customers The Company’s products and services predominantly serve the North American and Latin American energy markets, and primarily the commercial and industrial space. Based on recent market experience, it appears there may be some seasonality with deliveries decreasing in November and December each year, likely as a result of the US holiday season and as a result of varied customer appropriation cycles; however, we believe these market factors will continue to evolve and the Company’s insight to these trends will improve with continued commercial success and time. For the year ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively 58.3% and 34.8% of our total consolidated revenues were associated primarily with one customer. A loss or decline in business with this customer, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We provide our hardware products under contract manufacturing agreements. we provide our software and services at customer locations and from our offices located in Utah, Nevada and California . Working Capital Items We do not maintain significant inventory. Our inventory levels are currently adequate for our short-term needs based upon present levels of demand. We consider the component parts of our different products to be generally available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying anticipated needs. Distribution, Marketing and Strategic Relationships We have developed strategic relationships with well-established companies in key areas including distribution and manufacturing. We sell our products worldwide, with a primary focus on North America and Latin America, through our direct product sales force, and partner networks. Materials and Suppliers Although most components essential to our business are generally available from multiple sources. We believe there are component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to us could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition. The Company currently engages a contract manufacturer, whereby they exclusively manufacture parallel switchgear, automatic transfer switches and related control and circuit protective equipment for us. Historically, we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of our key materials or components provided by our suppliers, nor have we experienced a significant price increase for materials or components. We do not anticipate any such delays or significant price increases in our fiscal year 2021. Environmental Issues No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from the Company’s operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets that we serve, nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Competition We experience competition in all areas of our business. The markets we address for alternative energy and microgrid markets, energy controls and communications systems are characterized by the presence of both new start-ups and well-established product providers. We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include product features, including scalability, relative price and performance, lifetime operating cost, including any maintenance and support, product quality and reliability, safety, ease of use, rapid integration with new and existing distributed energy assets, customer support, design innovation, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation. Some of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources. Factors that could affect our ability increase sales of our System may include resource limitations, available information and our standards established for projected return on investment. Distributed Energy Management Business Competition Our DER Business and software platforms are set up to compete against larger companies. We offer an end-to-end suite of software solution that enables microgrids from design through operations and communication .Our integrated microgrid control platform seamlessly integrates energy generation with energy storage devices and controls facility loads to provide energy security in real time. The platforms are able to interoperate with the local utility grid and allows users the ability to obtain the most cost-effective power for a facility. The systems are technology agnostic and can incorporate into multiple vendors and manufacturers products and legacy systems. The systems are ideal for commercial, industrial, mining, defense, campus and community users ranging from 4 kw to 100 MW and beyond and can deliver power at or below the current cost of utility power. All of these attributes contribute to our ability to compete with the larger, more established competitors that have rely on their own manufactured products and hardware solutions. The principal advantages of our Platforms are: Distributed Energy and Microgrid control technologies are fairly new to the market and can be deployed in various formats. Eight technologies that are predominantly used in commercial applications and/or have been extensively studied are: Energy Modeling Business Competition Gasifier Business Competition Our Gasifier system is expected to compete against larger gasification projects. Our modular concept allows for parallel processing so a facility could be easily expanded or reduced without risk or changing the basic structure by simply adding or removing module units; it also allows for multiple end product processing, producing electricity, ethanol, and fuels simultaneously, and for universal parts which reduces maintenance costs. We expect a ll of these attributes contribute to our ability to compete with the larger, more established competitors that have large systems that require significant downtime for maintenance and repair. As previously disclosed, we plan to continue to focus on our other product offerings, as opposed to expending significant efforts on the Gasifier side of the business. Intellectual Property In relation to our microgrid business, we own the following patents: Patent No. 9,941,696 B2 ""Establishing Communication and Power Sharing Links Between Components of a Distributed Energy System, awarded April 10, 2018, is a revolutionary patent that specifically addresses CleanSpark's engineering and data-analytics technologies, processes and procedures. The patent covers CleanSpark's ability to receive data from a plurality of sources within a microgrid, which is then analyzed to forecast power needs across the microgrid, or a combination of multiple 'fractal' microgrids, and then determining whether or when to share power with the requesting module. In relation to our legacy gasifier business, we own the following patents: Patent No. 9,359,567 ‘Gasification Method Using Feedstock Comprising Gaseous Fuels’; Patent No. 8,518,133 ‘Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method’; and Patent No. 8,105,401 ‘Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method.’ ; Patent No. 8,347,829 Electrolytic Reactor and Related Methods for Supplementing the Air Intake of an Internal Combustion Engine. The second Patent, ""Parallel Path Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method, US 9,890, 340 B2"", awarded February 13, 2018, further enhances CleanSpark's patent portfolio surrounding its proprietary gasification and waste-to-energy technologies. Our patents begin to expire between 2028 and 2035. Government Regulation We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. It is anticipated that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with existing federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and human health will not have a material effect upon us, our capital expenditures, or earnings. We cannot predict what effect additional regulation or legislation, enforcement policies thereunder and claims for damages for injuries to property, employees, other persons and the environment resulting from our operations. Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by state and federal authorities including the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). This regulation has not increased the cost of planning, designing and operating to date. Although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of these operations, there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities, including criminal penalties, will not be incurred. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, including stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages for injuries to property or persons resulting from our activities could result in substantial costs and liabilities. In the conduct of our activities, our operations will be subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and similar state statutes require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in its operations. Certain of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in OSHA workplace standards. Other than the above regulations and maintaining our good standing in the State of Nevada, complying with applicable local business licensing requirements, complying with all state and federal tax requirements, preparing our periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and complying with other applicable securities laws, rules, and regulations, and our discussion related to our newly acquired ATL Data Centers LLC subsidiary regarding bitcoin mining operations, we do not believe that existing or probably governmental regulations will have a material effect on our operations. We do not currently require the approval of any governmental agency or affiliated program for our operations. Product Development Because the distributed energy and related software industry is still in an early state of adoption, our ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. We continue to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in order to drive further commercialization. We may also expand the range of our product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. Human Capital Resources; Employees; Personnel We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. As of December 14, 2020, we had 62 staff members with 56 full time salaried employees. We continue to seek additions to our staff, although the competition for such personnel in our segments is significant. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. Company Websites We maintain a corporate Internet website at: www.cleanspark.com and informational websites for our subsidiaries at www.p2klabs.com and www.gridfabric.io. The contents of these websites are not incorporated in or otherwise to be regarded as part of this Annual Report. We file reports with the SEC which are available on our website free of charge. These reports include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, “Section 16” filings on Form 3, Form 4, and Form 5, and other related filings, each of which is provided on our website as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file such materials with or furnish them to the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, including the Company. Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this report. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize, that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Risks Related to Our Business Our business may be subject to risks arising from pandemic, epidemic, or an outbreak of diseases, such as the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 illness. The recent outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a “public health emergency of international concern,” has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health pandemic, including COVID-19, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, the continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt the supply chain and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures may also have an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact. We lack an established operating history and have incurred losses in prior periods, expect to incur losses in the future and we can give no assurance that our operations will result in profits. We have a limited operating history that makes it difficult to evaluate our business. Historical sales pertaining to our products have been in insufficient to create positive cashflows or profitability, and we cannot say with certainty when we will begin to achieve profitability. Since inception, we have sustained $116,402,606 in cumulative net losses and we had a net loss for the fiscal year September 30, 2020 of $23,346,143. We expect to have operating losses at least until such time as we have developed a substantial and stable revenue base. We cannot assure you that we can develop a substantial and stable revenue base or achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Our future success is difficult to predict because we operate in emerging and evolving markets, and the industries in which we compete are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles. The renewable energy, microgrid and related industries are emerging and evolving markets which may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and which may lead to period to period variability in our operating results. Our products and services are based on unique technology which we believe offers significant advantages to our customers, but the markets we serve are in a relatively early stage of development and it is uncertain how rapidly they will develop. It is also uncertain whether our products will achieve high levels of demand and acceptance as these markets grow. If companies in the industries we serve do not perceive or value the benefits of our technologies and products, or if they are unwilling to adopt our products as alternatives to traditional power solutions, the market for our products and services may not develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, which could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. As a supplier to the renewable energy, microgrid and related industries, we may be subject to business cycles. The timing, length, and volatility of these business cycles may be difficult to predict. These industries may be cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers’ products, inventory levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital. These changes may affect the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology, and affect our orders, net sales, operating expenses, and net income. In addition, we may not be able to respond adequately or quickly to the declines in demand by reducing our costs. To meet rapidly changing demand in each of the industries we serve, we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity. During periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, effectively manage our supply chain, and motivate and retain key employees. During periods of increasing demand, we must have sufficient inventory to fulfill customer orders, effectively manage our supply chain, and attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned within a business cycle, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The industries in which we compete are highly competitive and we may be unable to successfully compete to survive. We compete in the market for renewable energy products and microgrid technology and associated services that is intensely competitive. Evolving industry standards, rapid price changes and product obsolescence also impact the market. Our competitors include many domestic and foreign companies, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. Our current competitors or new market entrants could introduce new or enhanced technologies, products or services with features that render our technologies, products or services obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. Our success will be dependent upon our ability to develop products that are superior to existing products and products introduced in the future, and which are cost effective. In addition, we may be required to continually enhance any products that are developed as well as introduce new products that keep pace with technological change and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of the marketplace. Even if our current technologies prove to be commercially feasible, there is extensive research and development being conducted on alternative energy sources that may render our technologies and protocols obsolete or otherwise non-competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep pace with the technological demands of the marketplace or successfully develop products that will succeed in the marketplace. As a small company, we will be at a competitive disadvantage to most of our competitors, which include larger, established companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other resources than us. There can be no assurance that we will have the capital resources available to undertake the research that may be necessary to upgrade our equipment or develop new devices to meet the efficiencies of changing technologies. Our inability to adapt to technological change could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. We rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our technology and enforcing those rights could disrupt our business operation and divert precious resources that could ultimately harm our future prospects. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and procedures and patents to protect our proprietary technologies. In relation to our microgrid business, we own the following patents: Patent No. 9,941,696 B2 and patent number 10,658,839 ""Establishing Communication and Power Sharing Links Between Components of a Distributed Energy System, awarded April 10, 2018, The patent covers CleanSpark's ability to receive data from a plurality of sources within a microgrid, which is then analyzed to forecast power needs across the microgrid, or a combination of multiple 'fractal' microgrids, and then determining whether or when to share power with the requesting module. We also own patent numbers 8,518,133 and 8,105,401 ‘Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method'’ and patent number 9,359,567 ‘Gasification Method Using Feedstock Comprising Gaseous Fuel’– which covers our Gasifier technology. We also own patent number 8,342,829 entitled ‘Electrolytic Reactor and Related Methods for Supplementing the Air Intake of an Internal Combustion Engine.’ The claims contained in any patent may not provide adequate protection for our products and technology. In the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know-how. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to this technology to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If a dispute arises concerning our technology, we could become involved in litigation that might involve substantial cost. Litigation could divert substantial management attention away from our operations and into efforts to enforce our patents, protect our trade secrets or know-how or determine the scope of the proprietary rights of others. If a proceeding resulted in adverse findings, we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties. We might also be required to seek licenses from third parties to manufacture or sell our products. Our ability to manufacture and sell our products may also be adversely affected by other unforeseen factors relating to the proceeding or its outcome. As we continue to grow and to develop our intellectual property, we could attract threats from patent monetization firms or competitors alleging infringement of intellectual property rights. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. If we do not prevail in this type of litigation, we may be required to: pay monetary damages; stop commercial activities relating to our product; obtain one or more licenses in order to secure the rights to continue manufacturing or marketing certain products; or attempt to compete in the market with substantially similar products. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue some of our operations. A material part of our success will depend on our ability to manage our suppliers and contract manufacturers. Our failure to manage our suppliers and contract manufacturers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers. We rely upon suppliers to provide the components necessary to build our products and on contract manufacturers to procure components and assemble our products. There can be no assurance that key suppliers and contract manufacturers will provide components or products in a timely and cost efficient manner or otherwise meet our needs and expectations. Our ability to manage such relationships and timely replace suppliers and contract manufacturers, if necessary, is critical to our success. Our failure to timely replace our contract manufacturers and suppliers, should that become necessary, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers. If we are the subject of future product defect or liability suits, our business will likely fail. In the course of our planned operations, we may become subject to legal actions based on a claim that our products are defective in workmanship or have caused personal or other injuries. We currently maintain liability insurance but there can be no guarantee that such coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims. Moreover, even if we are able to maintain sufficient insurance coverage in the future, any successful claim could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be exposed to lawsuits and other claims if our products malfunction, which could increase our expenses, harm our reputation and prevent us from growing our business. Any liability for damages resulting from malfunctions of our products could be substantial, increase our expenses and prevent us from growing or continuing our business. Potential customers may rely on our products for critical needs and a malfunction of our products could result in warranty claims or other product liability. In addition, a well-publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect the market’s perception of our products. This could result in a decline in demand for our products, which would reduce revenue and harm our business. Further, since our products are used in systems that are made up on components made by other manufacturers, we may be subject to product liability claims even if our products do not malfunction. Any failure by management to properly manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. If our business develops as expected, we anticipate that we will grow rapidly in the near future. Our failure to properly manage our expected rapid growth could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain key personnel. Our expansion could also place significant demands on our management, operations, systems, accounting, internal controls and financial resources. If we experience difficulties in any of these areas, we may not be able to expand our business successfully or effectively manage our growth. Any failure by management to manage growth and to respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The lack of management experience in the renewable energy and microgrid industries could adversely affect our company. Some members of management and the board of directors may not have prior experience in the energy industry. Some members do, however, have extensive work experience in the reclamation, environmental industries, energy industries, financial/accounting industries, and business management. The lack of experience in the alternative energy industry may impair our managements’ and directors’ ability to evaluate and make decisions involving our current operations and any future projects we may undertake in the alternative energy industry. Such impairment and lack of experience could adversely affect our business, financial condition and future operations. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled experts and workers our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected and our costs may increase. Our rate of growth will be confined by resource limitations as competitors and customers compete for increasingly scarce resources. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of affordable trained experts that can execute our operational strategy. The demand for trained software engineers, electrical engineers and other skilled workers is currently high. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected and the costs of performing our existing and future projects may increase, which may adversely impact our margins. We have engaged in and may engage in acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders, reduce our financial resources and harm our operating results. We have been involved in significant acquisitions in our lifespan. In the future, we may seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisition will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate an acquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre–acquisition due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products or the acquired business. Our business is substantially dependent on utility rate structures and government incentive programs that encourage the use of alternative energy sources. The reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for energy-related technologies would harm our business. We believe that near-term growth of energy-related technologies, including power conversion technology, relies partly on the availability and size of government and economic incentives and grants (including, but not limited to, the U.S. Investment Tax Credit and various state and local incentive programs). These incentive programs could be challenged by utility companies, or for other reasons found to be unconstitutional, and/or could be reduced or discontinued for other reasons. The reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives could harm our business. A combination of utility rate structures and government subsidies that encourage the use of alternative energy sources is a primary driver of demand for our products. For example, public utilities are often allowed to collect demand charges on commercial and industrial customers in addition to traditional usage charges. In addition, the federal government and many states encourage the use of alternative energy sources through a combination of direct subsidies and tariff incentives such as net metering for users that use alternative energy sources such as solar power. California also encourages alternative energy technology through its Self-Generation Incentive Program, or SGIP, which offers rebates for businesses and consumers who adopt certain new technologies. Other states have similar incentives and mandates which encourage the adoption of alternative energy sources. Notwithstanding the adoption of other incentive programs, we expect that California will be the most significant market for the sale of our products in the near term. Should California or another state in which we derive a substantial portion of our product revenues in the future change its utility rate structure or eliminate or significantly reduce its incentive programs, demand for our products could be substantially affected, which would adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and operating results. Although we have obtained sufficient funding for the foreseeable future, if we do not obtain increased revenues in 2021 and beyond, we may have to seek additional financing or scale back or cease our activities , which may significantly harm our chances of success. Because we currently operate at a loss, we are dependent on generating additional revenue. The majority of our financing in 2020 was from the sale of our common stock. Subsequently, on October 9, 2020 we obtained approximately $40,000,000 before underwriting and offering expenses in connection with an underwritten public offering. While this financing is expected to carry us through 2021 and beyond, we need to generate cashflows from revenues. As explained in this annual report, these cashflows are needed to increase our sales and marketing efforts, for continued upgrades to our software, and for working capital. We believe that near-term growth of energy-related technologies, including power conversion technology, relies partly on the availability and size of government and economic incentives and grants (including, but not limited to, the U.S. Investment Tax Credit and various state and local incentive programs). These incentive programs could be challenged by utility companies, or for other reasons found to be unconstitutional, and/or could be reduced or discontinued for other reasons. The reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives could harm our business. Risks Related to Our Securities Our common stock price may be volatile and could fluctuate widely in price, which could result in substantial losses for investors. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: Because we have limited revenues to date, you should consider any one of these factors to be material. Our stock price may fluctuate widely as a result of any of the above. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have the right to issue shares of preferred stock. If we were to issue preferred stock, it is likely to have rights, preferences and privileges that may adversely affect the common stock. We are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time-to-time by our board of directors. Our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix for any series the dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights, and other rights, preferences and privileges for the preferred stock. We currently have 1,750,000 shares of our series A preferred stock outstanding, the features of which are contained elsewhere in this annual report. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the preferred stock, could reduce the voting rights and powers of the common stock and the portion of our assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution in the book value per share of the common stock . The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, to the detriment of the investors in the common stock offered hereby. We cannot assure you that we will not, under certain circumstances, issue shares of our preferred stock. We have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay dividends. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to market our products and to cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, you should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock. If securities or industry analysts do not publish or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us now or in the future issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions. Members of our board of directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws as authorized by the Nevada Revised Statutes. Specifically, Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a director or officer is not individually liable to the company or its shareholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer unless it is proven that (1) the director’s or officer’s act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and (2) his or her breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This provision is intended to afford directors and officers protection against and to limit their potential liability for monetary damages resulting from suits alleging a breach of the duty of care by a director or officer. Accordingly, you may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their fiduciary duty of care. In addition, our Bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if you were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses they incurred in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Risks Related to Our ATL Data Centers Subsidiary On December 9, 2020, we acquired ATL Data Centers LLC (“ATL”) that, in addition to being a traditional data center operation, operates, currently, 3,471 bitcoin mining units (“ASICs”), with the Company’s intent to significantly increase that number. Government regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrency is being actively considered by the United States federal government via its agencies and regulatory bodies, as well as similar entities in other countries and transnational organizations, such as the European Union. State and local regulations also may apply to our activities and other activities in which we may participate in the future. Other governmental or semi-governmental regulatory bodies have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or cryptocurrency business. For instance, the SEC has taken an active role in regulating the use of public offerings of proprietary coins (so-called “Initial Coin Offerings”) and has made statements and official promulgations as to the status of certain cryptocurrencies as “securities” subject to regulation by the SEC. Presently, we do not believe any U.S. or State regulatory body has taken any action or position adverse to our main cryptocurrency, bitcoin, with respect to its production, sale, and use as a medium of exchange; however, future changes to existing regulations or entirely new regulations may affect our business in ways it is not presently possible for us to predict with any reasonable degree of reliability. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, such as further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities. If regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require our registration as a money services business (“MSB”) under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, or otherwise under state laws, we may incur significant compliance costs, which could be substantial or cost-prohibitive. If we become subject to these regulations, our costs in complying with them may have a material negative effect on our business and the results of our operations. To the extent that the activities of ATL cause it to be deemed an MSB under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, we may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate us to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records. To the extent that the activities of ATL cause it to be deemed a “money transmitter” (“MT”) or equivalent designation, under state law in any state in which ATL operates, ATL may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. Currently, the NYSDFS has finalized its “BitLicense” framework for businesses that conduct “virtual currency business. ATL will continue to monitor for developments in such legislation, guidance or regulations applicable to ATL. Such additional federal or state regulatory obligations may cause ATL to incur extraordinary expenses, possibly affecting its business and financial condition in a material and adverse manner. Furthermore, ATL and its service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to MSBs and MTs. If ATL is deemed to be subject to and determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may act to dissolve and liquidate ATL. Any such action may adversely affect business operations and financial condition. Current regulation of the exchange of bitcoins under the CEA by the CFTC is unclear; to the extent we become subject to regulation under the CFTC in connection with our exchange of bitcoin, we may incur additional compliance costs, which may be significant. Current legislation, including the Commodities Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the “CEA”) is unclear with respect to the exchange of bitcoins. Changes in the CEA or the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as interpretations thereof and official promulgations by the Commodities Futures Tradition Commission (“CFTC”), which oversees the CEA much like the SEC oversees the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, may impact the classification of bitcoins and therefore may subject them to additional regulatory oversight by the CFTC. Presently, bitcoin derivatives are not excluded from the definition of a “commodity future” by the CFTC. We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins under the law. Bitcoins have been deemed to fall within the definition of a commodity and, we may be required to register and comply with additional regulation under the CEA, including additional periodic report and disclosure standards and requirements. Moreover, we may be required to register as a commodity pool operator or as a commodity pool with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses, thereby materially and adversely impacting an investment in us. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in us. As of the date of this annual report, no CFTC orders or rulings are applicable to our business. If we acquire digital securities, even unintentionally, we may violate the Investment Company Act of 1940 and incur potential third-party liabilities. The Company intends to comply with the 1940 Act in all respects. To that end, if holdings of cryptocurrencies are determined to constitute investment securities of a kind that subject the Company to registration and reporting under the 1940 Act, the Company will limit its holdings to less than 40% of its assets. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act defines “investment company” to mean any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Section 3(a)(2) of the 1940 Act defines “investment securities” to include all securities except (A) Government securities, (B) securities issued by employees’ securities companies, and (C) securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries which (i) are not investment companies and (ii) are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company in section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. As noted above, the SEC has not stated whether bitcoin and cryptocurrency is an investment security, as defined in the 1940 Act. The further development and acceptance of digital asset networks and other digital assets, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital asset systems may adversely affect an investment in us. Digital assets such as bitcoins, that may be used, among other things, to buy and sell goods and services are a new and rapidly evolving industry of which the digital asset networks are prominent, but not unique, parts. The growth of the digital asset industry in general, and the digital asset networks of bitcoin in particular, are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of the digital asset industry, as well as the digital asset networks, include: A decline in the popularity or acceptance of the digital asset networks of bitcoin or ether, or similar digital asset systems, could adversely affect an investment in us. Since there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting or taxation of digital assets other than digital securities, it is unclear how we will be required to account for digital asset transactions and the taxation of our businesses. There is currently no authoritative literature under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which specifically addresses the accounting for digital assets, including digital currencies. Therefore, by analogy, we intend to record digital assets similar to financial instruments under ASC 825, Financial Instruments, because the economic nature of these digital assets is most closely related to a financial instrument such as an investment in a foreign currency. We believe that the Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Our material revenue stream is expected to be related to the mining of digital currencies. We will derive revenue by providing transaction verification services within the digital currency networks of crypto-currencies, such as bitcoin commonly termed “crypto-currency mining.” In consideration for these services, ee expect to receive digital currency (also known as “Coins”). Coins are generally recorded as revenue, using the average spot price on the date of receipt. The Coins are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. Gains or losses on sale of Coins are recorded in the statement of operations. Expenses associated with running the crypto-currency mining business, such as equipment deprecation, and electricity cost are recorded as cost of revenues. In 2014, the IRS issued guidance in Notice 2014-21 that classified cryptocurrency as property, not currency, for federal income tax purposes. But according to the requirements of FATCA, which requires foreign financial institutions to provide the IRS with information about accounts held by U.S. taxpayers or foreign entities controlled by U.S. taxpayers, cryptocurrency exchanges, in the ordinary course of doing business, are considered financial institutions. On November 30, 2016, a federal judge in the Northern District of California granted an IRS application to serve a “John Doe” summons on Coinbase Inc., which operates a cryptocurrency wallet and exchange business. The summons asked Coinbase to identify all U.S. customers who transferred convertible cryptocurrency from 2013 to 2015. The IRS is trying to get cryptocurrency owners to report the value of their wallets to the federal government and the IRS is treating cryptocurrency as both property and currency. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recommended in a June 2016 letter to the IRS that cryptocurrency accounts be reported in the summary information section of Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, which breaks with the IRS’s 2014 guidance that cryptocurrency be treated as property. Property is divided into certain sections within the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) that determine everything from how the property is treated at sale, to how the property is depreciated, to the nature and character of the gain on sale of the asset. For instance, IRC §1231 property (real or depreciable business property held for more than one year) is treated as capital in nature when sold for a profit, but it is treated as ordinary when the property is sold for a loss. IRC §1245 property, on the other hand, is treated as ordinary in nature. IRC §1245 property encompasses most types of property. IRC §1250 property covers everything else. IRC §1250 states that a gain from selling real property that has been depreciated should be taxed as ordinary income, to the extent that the accumulated depreciation exceeds the depreciation calculated using the straight-line method, which is the most basic depreciation method used on an income statement. IRC §1250 bases the amount of tax due on the type of property, such as residential or nonresidential property, and on how many months the property was owned. IRS guidance is silent on which section of the tax code cryptocurrency falls into. For instance, IRC §1031 allows for the like-kind exchange of certain property. IRC §1031 exchanges typically are done with real estate or business assets. However, with the classification of cryptocurrency as property by the IRS, many tax professionals will argue that cryptocurrency can be exchanged using IRC §1031. We believe that all of our digital asset mining activities will be accounted for on the same basis regardless of the form of digital asset. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards or interpretation by the IRS or accounting standards or the SEC could result in changes in our accounting treatment, taxation and the necessity to restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Digital assets held by us are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections. We do not hold our digital assets with a banking institution or a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) and, therefore, our digital assets are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions. Because many of our digital assets are held by digital asset exchanges, we face heightened risks from cybersecurity attacks and financial stability of digital asset exchanges. ATL may transfer their digital asset from its wallet to digital asset exchanges prior to selling them. Digital assets not held in ATL ‘s wallet are subject to the risks encountered by digital asset exchanges including a DDoS Attack or other malicious hacking, a sale of the digital asset exchange, loss of the digital assets by the digital asset exchange and other risks similar to those described herein. ATL does not maintain a custodian agreement with any of the digital asset exchanges that hold the ATL digital assets. These digital asset exchanges do not provide insurance and may lack the resources to protect against hacking and theft. If this were to occur, ATL may be materially and adversely affected. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties Currently, we do not own any real estate. Our corporate offices are located at 1185 S. 1800 W, Suite 3, Woods Cross Utah 84087. We are currently on a year-to-year lease agreement that calls for us to make payments of $2,300 per month. We sublease offices located at 8475 S. Eastern Ave., Suite 200, Las Vegas, NV. We are currently on a year-to-year lease agreement that calls for us to make payments of $1,525 per month. We operate our California operations out of leased office space located at 4360 Viewridge Avenue, Suite C, San Diego, California 92123. On May 15, 2018, we executed a 37-month lease agreement, which commenced on July 1, 2018. The agreement calls for us to make payments of $4,057 in base rent per month through July 31, 2021 subject to an annual 3% rent escalation. Future minimum lease payments under the operating leases for the facilities as of September 30, 2020, are as follows: The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to litigation, claims, investigations and audits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. CleanSpark, Inc. v. Discover Growth Fund, LLC On August 5, 2020, the Company filed a verified complaint (the “Complaint”) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Discover Growth Fund, LLC (“Investor”). Among other things, the Complaint seeks: declaratory relief against Investor in response to Investor’s claim that a Form 8-K filed by the Company in relation to a July 20, 2020 securities purchase agreement needed pre-approval by Investor prior to filing, and injunctive relief in response to conversion notices sent by Investor claiming trigger events and defaults arising out of the failure to obtain the Form 8-K pre-approval. The case was subsequently removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which then determined that the parties’ agreements required a JAMS arbitrator sitting in the U.S. Virgin Islands to resolve the parties’ dispute over which of their agreements’ competing forum selection clauses was controlling, and that therefore the Court’s personal jurisdiction over Investor had not been established. While the New York action was pending, Investor filed a demand for arbitration with JAMS in the U.S. Virgin Islands, alleging breach of the Securities Purchase Agreement dated December 31, 2018, and the Purchase Agreement dated April 17, 2019 between Investor and the Company (the “Arbitration”) and seeking issuance of additional shares of the Company. The Company then filed a response to Investor’s claims, denying Investor’s claims and asserting counterclaims against Investor, and also filed for emergency injunctive relief in the Arbitration seeking, among other things, an order enjoining Investor from continuing to pursue certain remedies based on the allegations in the Arbitration between Investor and the Company. On September 21, 2020, the arbitrator granted the Company’s motion for emergency interim relief in the Arbitration. The arbitrator issued his interim award on September 22, 2020, (the “Interim Award”), which restrains Investor from: (i) proceeding with an asset sale or taking any actions in furtherance of the asset sale; (ii) pursuing any remedies in connection with the purported trigger events, conversion notices, notices of default, or sale notices that Investor issued; (iii) claiming or issuing any additional trigger events, conversion notices, delivery notices, notices of default, or sale notices pursuant to the debenture, note, or prior securities purchase agreements between the parties that relate to or arise out of the facts and allegations at issue in the Arbitration; and (iv) pursuing any other remedies that relate to or arise out of the facts and allegations at issue in the Arbitration. Following the Interim Award, the Company completed an underwritten public offering with HC Wainwright (the “Offering”). In connection with the Offering, the Company provided notice to Investor of the Offering in compliance with a right of first refusal provision (the “ROFR”) in the parties’ agreements with the Company. Investor responded to the notice claiming that the notice was not sufficient and the ROFR was not satisfied by the notice and, as a result, proceeding with the Offering constituted a trigger event under the parties’ prior securities purchase agreements. Investor included the preceding allegations regarding the ROFR in its statement of claim in the Arbitration, and they are now at issue in that proceeding. The Company forcefully denies those claims. Although the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined with certainty, the Company believes that the claims raised by Investor in and related to the Arbitration are completely without merit, and the Company intends to both defend itself vigorously and to vigorously prosecute its counterclaims. Additionally, the Company believes that it has fully complied with its obligations under the right of first refusal and public disclosure review provisions of the parties’ prior securities purchase agreements. Notwithstanding the merits of Investor’s claims, however, the Arbitration may distract the Company and cost the Company’s management time, effort and expense to defend against the claims and threats made by Investor. Notwithstanding the Company’s belief that it has complied with all of its obligations under the parties’ agreements, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the Arbitration, and in the event the Company does not prevail in such action, the Company, its business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Information Our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CLSK.” Holders of Our Common Stock As of December 14, 2020, we had 223 registered holders of record of our common stock, with others in street name. The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of the common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. Dividends There are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend: We have not declared any dividends and we do not plan to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None. Repurchases The Company has not made any repurchases of shares or other units of any class of the Company’s equity securities during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report. Item 6. Selected Financial Data As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as “anticipate”, “estimate”, “plan”, “project”, “continuing”, “ongoing”, “expect”, “believe”, “intend”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “could”, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Results of Operations for the Year Ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 Revenues We earned $10,028,701 in revenues during the year ended September 30, 2020, as compared with $4,532,782 in revenues for the year ended September 30, 2019. For the year ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 our revenue was derived from of the sale of equipment, design, engineering and services revenue. This income from our Energy segment is the result of contracts to sell switchgear equipment, perform engineering design, and provide software for distributed energy and microgrid systems. For the year ended September 30, 2020, we also generated services revenue from our January 2020 acquisition of p2kLabs, Inc. We hope to generate more significant revenue from customers through the sale and licensing of our Software platforms and services in the future. However, we are unable to estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of future revenues, from existing or future software contracts. Also, we do not anticipate earning significant revenues from our Gasifier business until such time that we have fully developed our technology and are able to market our products. Gross Profit Our cost of revenues were $7,907,849 for the year ended September 30, 2020 resulting in gross profit of $2,120,852, as compared with cost of revenues of $3,861,086 for the year ended September 30, 2019 resulting in gross profits of $671,696.

Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year ended September 30, 2020, our primary sources of liquidity came from existing cash, and proceeds from a securities purchase agreement. On October 6, 2020 , the Company completed a share offering which resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately $37,000,000. Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements until the Company reaches profitability, and we are not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in a decrease in liquidity of our assets. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing, the timing of new product introductions and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may open a revolving line of credit with a bank, or we may have to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities. In the event such financing is needed in the future, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us, or, if available, that it will be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. If cash flows from operations became insufficient to continue operations at the current level, and if no additional financing was obtained, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. As of September 30, 2020, we had total current assets of $8,251,858, consisting of cash, accounts receivable, contract assets and prepaid expenses and other current assets, and total assets in the amount of $22,340,063. Our total current liabilities as of September 30, 2019 were $5,382,529. We had a working capital surplus of $2,869,329 as of September 30, 2020. Operating activities used $6,642,734 in cash for the year ended September 30, 2019, as compared with $5,697,989 for the same period ended September 30, 2019. Our net loss of $23,346,143 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2020, offset mainly by amortization of debt discount of $9,010,547, depreciation and amortization of $2,672,331, shares issued as interest of $2,050,000, amortization of capitalized software of $163,918 and stock-based compensation of $2,053,232. Our net loss of $26,116,932 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2019, offset mainly by impairment expense of $6,915,186, depreciation and amortization of $1,902,981, shares issued as interest of $1,400,000, amortization of capitalized software of $1,453,635 and stock-based compensation of $1,993,043. Cash flows used by investing activities during the year ended September 30, 2020 was $2,383,623, as compared with $673,953 for the year ended September 30, 2019. Our acquisitions of p2kLabs & GridFabric of $1,513,802, investments in the capitalized software of $84,924, purchase of fixed assets of $34,897 and the investment in debt and equity securities of $750,000 were the main components of our negative investing cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2020. Our investment in the capitalized software of $569,042, purchase of fixed assets of $102,761 and the purchase of intangible assets of $2,150 were the main components of our negative investing cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2019. Cash flows provided by financing activities during the year ended September 30, 2020 amounted to $4,313,702, as compared with $13,798,022 for the year ended September 30, 2019. Our positive cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2020 consisted of $4,000,000 in proceeds from the sale of common stock, $531,169 in proceeds from promissory notes off-set by repayments of $217,467 on promissory notes. Our positive cash flows from financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2019 consisted of $361,800 in proceeds from the sale of common stock, 14,995,000 in proceeds from convertible notes and $75,030 from related party debts off-set by repayments of $625,344 on promissory notes repayments of $457,820 on related party debt, and repayments of $555,000 on convertible debts. Known Trends or Uncertainties Although we have not seen any significant reduction in revenues to date, we have seen some consolidation in our industry during economic downturns. These consolidations have not had a negative effect on our total sales; however, should consolidations and downsizing in the industry continue to occur, those events could adversely impact our revenues and earnings going forward. As discussed in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the world has been affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Until the pandemic has passed, there remains uncertainty as to the effect of COVID-19 on our business in both the short and long-term. We believe that the need for improved productivity in the research and development activities directed toward developing new products and/or software will continue to result in increasing adoption of energy solution tools such as those we produce. New product and/or software developments in the energy business segment could result in increased revenues and earnings if they are accepted by our markets; however, there can be no assurances that new products and/or software will result in significant improvements to revenues or earnings. For competitive reasons, we do not disclose all of our new product development activities. Our continued quest for acquisitions could result in a significant change to revenues and earnings if one or more such acquisitions are completed. The potential for growth in new markets is uncertain. We will continue to explore these opportunities until such time as we either generate sales or determine that resources would be more efficiently used elsewhere. Inflation We have not been affected materially by inflation during the periods presented, and no material effect is expected in the near future. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, ""Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,"" which modifies the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees to largely align it with the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for us for annual periods beginning October 1, 2019. The new standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,"" which allows for the capitalization of certain implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. ASU 2018-15 allows for either retrospective adoption or prospective adoption to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ""Leases"" (""ASC 842""). The guidance requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Existing sale-leaseback guidance, including guidance for real estate, is replaced with a new model applicable to both lessees and lessors. ASC 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Upon adoption of this guidance, on October 1, 2019, the Company recorded a Right of use asset and corresponding lease liability of $85,280 and $85,280, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. No cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings resulted from adoption of this guidance. The new standard did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows. The Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most “critical accounting polices” in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results, and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in the footnotes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019, however we consider our critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition, long-lived assets, accounts receivable, fair value of financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, warranty liability and stock-based compensation. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2020, there were no off balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Index to Financial Statements Required by Article 8 of Regulation S-X: Audited Consolidated Financial Statements: To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of CleanSpark, Inc. Woods Cross, Utah Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CleanSpark, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ MaloneBailey, LLP www.malonebailey.com We have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.

ORGANIZATION AND LINE OF BUSINESS Organization CleanSpark, Inc. (“CleanSpark”, “we”, “our”, the ""Company"") was incorporated in the state of Nevada on October 15, 1987 as SmartData Corporation. SmartData conducted a 504-public offering in the State of Nevada in December 1987 and began trading publicly in January 1988. Due to a series of unfortunate events, including the untimely death of the founding CEO, SmartData discontinued active business operations in 1992. On March 25, 2014, we began operations in the alternative energy sector.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES This summary of significant accounting policies of CleanSpark is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity The Company has incurred losses for the past several years while developing infrastructure and its software platforms. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred net losses of $ 23,346,143 and $ 26,116,932 during the years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. In response to these conditions and to ensure the Company has sufficient capital for ongoing operations for a minimum of 12 months we have raised additional capital through the sale of debt and equity securities pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had working capital of approximately $ 2,869,329 . Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CleanSpark, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, CleanSpark, LLC, CleanSpark, II, LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems Inc, p2kLabs, Inc, and GridFabric, LLC. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities. Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company’s goodwill impairment, intangible assets acquired, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, allowances for uncollectible accounts, and the valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions including, but not limited to, the ultimate impact that COVID-10 may have on the Company’s operations. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the Financial Accounting Standard Board's (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, which requires that five steps be followed in evaluating revenue recognition: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identity the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfied a performance obligation. We did not have a cumulative impact as of October 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Topic 606. Our accounting policy on revenue recognition by type of revenue is provided below. Engineering & Construction Contracts and Service Contracts The Company recognizes engineering and construction contract revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer. Engineering and construction contracts are generally accounted for as a single unit of account (a single performance obligation) and are not segmented between types of services. The Company recognizes revenue based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost (an input method). The input method is the most faithful depiction of the Company’s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer. Customer-furnished materials, labor and equipment and, in certain cases, subcontractor materials, labor and equipment, are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent (i.e., the company integrates the materials, labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer). Customer-furnished materials are only included in revenue and cost when the contract includes construction activity and the Company has visibility into the amount the customer is paying for the materials or there is a reasonable basis for estimating the amount. The Company recognizes revenue, but not profit, on certain uninstalled materials that are not specifically produced, fabricated, or constructed for a project. Revenue on these uninstalled materials is recognized when the cost is incurred (when control is transferred). Changes to total estimated contract cost or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level. Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred unless they are expected to be recovered from the client. Project mobilization costs are generally charged to project costs as incurred when they are an integrated part of the performance obligation being transferred to the client. Customer payments on engineering and construction contracts are typically due within 30 to 45 days of billing, depending on the contract. For service contracts (including maintenance contracts) in which the Company has the right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date, revenue is recognized when services are performed and contractually billable. Service contracts that include multiple performance obligations are segmented between types of services. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. Revenue recognized on service contracts that have not been billed to clients is classified as a current asset under contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized on service contracts to date are classified as a current liability under contract liabilities. Customer payments on service contracts are typically due within 30 days of billing, depending on the contract. Revenues from Sale of Equipment Performance Obligations Satisfied at a point in time. We recognize revenue on agreements for non-customized equipment we sell on a standardized basis to the market at a point in time. We recognize revenue at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is generally upon shipment or when the customer has physical possession of the product depending on contract terms. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (i.e., time between shipment and delivery). Generally, shipping costs are included in the price of equipment unless the customer requests a non-standard shipment. In situations where an alternative shipment arrangement has been made, the Company recognizes the shipping revenue upon customer receipt of the shipment. In situations where arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the goods and that acceptance is likely to occur. We generally do not provide for anticipated losses on point in time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer. Our billing terms for these point in time equipment contracts vary and generally coincide with shipment to the customer; however, within certain businesses, we receive progress payments from customers for large equipment purchases, which is generally to reserve production slots with our manufacturing partners, which are recorded as contract liabilities. Due to the customized nature of the equipment, the Company does not allow for customer returns. Service Performance obligations satisfied over time. We enter into long-term product service agreements with our customers primarily within our microgrid segment. These agreements require us to provide preventative maintenance, and standby support services that include certain levels of assurance regarding system performance throughout the contract periods, these contracts will generally range from 1 to 10 years. We account for items that are integral to the maintenance of the equipment as part of our service-related performance obligation, unless the customer has a substantive right to make a separate purchasing decision (e.g., equipment upgrade). Contract modifications that extend or revise contract terms are not uncommon and generally result in our recognizing the impact of the revised terms prospectively over the remaining life of the modified contract (i.e., effectively like a new contract). Revenues are recognized for these arrangements on a straight-line basis consistent with the nature, timing and extent of our services, which primarily relate to routine maintenance and as needed product repairs. Our billing terms for these contracts vary, but we generally invoice periodically as services are provided. Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed and include unbilled receivables (typically for cost reimbursable contracts) of $ 0 and contract work in progress (typically for fixed-price contracts) of $ 4,103 and $ 57,077 as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Unbilled receivables, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time, are reclassified to accounts receivable when they are billed under the terms of the contract. Advances that are payments on account of contract assets of $ 0 and $ 0 as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively, have been deducted from contract assets. Contract liabilities represent amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized to date. The Company recorded $ 64,198 and $ 499,401 in contract liabilities as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Revenues from software The Company derives its software revenue from both subscription fees from customers for access to its energy software offerings and software license sales and support services. Revenues from software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer and revenues from the related support is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. The Company’s policy is to exclude sales and other indirect taxes when measuring the transaction price of its subscription agreements. The Company’s subscription agreements generally have monthly or annual contractual terms. Revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term beginning on the date that the platform is made available to a customer. Access to the platform represents a series of distinct services as the Company continually provides access to, and fulfills its obligation to the end customer over the subscription term. The series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time. Revenues from design, software development and other technology-based consulting services For service contracts performed under Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) and accompanying Statement(s) of Work (“SOW”), revenue is recognized based on the performance obligation(s) outlined in the SOW which is typically hours worked or specific deliverable milestones. In the case of a milestone-based SOW, the Company recognizes revenues as each deliverable is signed off by the customer. Variable Consideration The nature of the Company’s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims and unpriced change orders; awards and incentive fees; and liquidated damages and penalties. The Company recognizes revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value (i.e., the sum of a probability-weighted amount) or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount. Factors considered in determining whether revenue associated with claims (including change orders in dispute and unapproved change orders in regard to both scope and price) should be recognized include the following: (a) the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim, (b) additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and not the result of deficiencies in the company’s performance, (c) claim-related costs are identifiable and considered reasonable in view of the work performed, and (d) evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable. If the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met, revenue is recorded only when the costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred. Back charges to suppliers or subcontractors are recognized as a reduction of cost when it is determined that recovery of such cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated. Disputed back charges are recognized when the same requirements described above for claims accounting have been satisfied. The C ompany generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its engineering and construction contracts. The warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of the Company’s work on a project. Historically, warranty claims have not resulted in material costs incurred. Practical Expedients If the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Company’s performance completed to date (a service contract in which the company bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), the Company recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice for services performed. The Company does not adjust the contract price for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the company transfers a service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service will be one year or less. The Company has made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are collected by the Company from its customers (use taxes, value added taxes, some excise taxes). For the year ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company reported revenues of $ 10,028,701 and $ 4,532,782 , respectively. Cash and cash equivalents For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments and short-term debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There was $ 3,126,202 and $ 7,838,857 in cash and no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Accounts receivable Is comprised of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and management closely monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reviewed periodically for collectability. If management determines that collection is unlikely, an allowance that reflects management’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected is recorded. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $ 42,970 and $ 254,570 at September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019, respectively. Retention receivable is the amount withheld by a customer until a contract is completed. Retention receivables of $ 615 and $ 159,989 were included in the balance of trade accounts receivable as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. Investment securities Investment securities include debt securities and equity securities. Debt securities are classified as available for sale (“AFS”) and are reported as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their estimated fair value. As the fair values of AFS debt securities change, the changes are reported net of income tax as an element of OCI, except for other-than-temporarily-impaired securities. When AFS debt securities are sold, the unrealized gains or losses are reclassified from OCI to non-interest income. Securities classified as AFS are securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sell a security classified as AFS would be based on various factors, including significant movements in interest rates, changes in the maturity mix of the Company’s assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, decline in credit quality, and regulatory capital considerations. Interest income is recognized based on the coupon rate and increased by accretion of discounts earned or decreased by the amortization of premiums paid over the contractual life of the security. For individual debt securities where the Company either intends to sell the security or more likely than not will not recover all of its amortized cost, the OTTI is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. For individual debt securities for which a credit loss has been recognized in earnings, interest accruals and amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts are suspended when the credit loss is recognized. Interest received after accruals have been suspended is recognized in income on a cash basis. The Company holds investments in both publicly held and privately held equity securities. Privately held equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment. All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized or unrealized, are recorded through gains or losses on equity securities on the consolidated statement of operations. Publicly held equity securities are based on fair value accounting with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as unrealized gains or losses on equity securities in our consolidated statements of operations. Concentration Risk At times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of FDIC limits. As of September 30, 2020, the cash balance in excess of the FDIC limits was $ 2,876,202 . The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in these accounts. The Company had certain customers whose revenue individually represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue. (See Note 18 for details.) Warranty Liability The Company establishes warranty liability reserves to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of installation and product defects, product recalls and litigation incidental to the Company’s business. Liability estimates are determined based on management’s judgment, considering such factors as historical experience, the likely current cost of corrective action, manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action, consultations with third party experts such as engineers, and discussions with the Company’s general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases. The Company’s manufacturers and service providers currently provide substantial warranties between ten to twenty-five years with full reimbursement to replace and install replacement parts. Warranty costs and associated liabilities for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were $ 0 and $ 0 , respectively. Stock -based compensation The Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10 “Compensation-Stock Compensation,” which requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company may issue compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management, accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services. Earnings (loss) per share The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 260-10 “Earnings Per Share,” which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2020, there are 1,577,013 shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants which have been excluded as anti-dilutive. Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Long-lived Assets In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounts Standard Codification (ASC) ASC 360-10, ""Property, Plant and Equipment,"" the carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. During the year ended September 30, 2020 the Company did not record an impairment expense and during the year ended September 30, 2019 the Company recorded an impairment expense of $ 6,915,186 related to software acquired in 2016 which the Company does not anticipate utilizing in future periods. Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The Company reviews its indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In accordance with its policies, the Company performed an assessment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill and determined there was no impairment for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Software Development Costs The Company capitalizes software development costs under guidance of ASC 985-20 “Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed” for our mPulse platform and under ASC 350-40 “Internal Use Software” for our mVSO, Canvas & Plaid products. Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and infrastructure design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established, and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of ""Product development."" Capitalized costs for products that are cancelled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to ""Product development"" in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development, such as product enhancements to existing features, which are not capitalized are charged immediately to ""Product development."" Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to ""Cost of revenues—software amortization "" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of seven years for our current product offerings. In recognition of the uncertainties involved in estimating future revenue, amortization will never be less than straight-line amortization of the products remaining estimated economic life. We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior periods, the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the software platform to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable software; orders for the product prior to its release; pending contracts and general market conditions. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations. If an impairment occurs the reduced amount of the capitalized software costs that have been written down to the net realizable value at the close of each annual fiscal period will be considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. Fair Value of financial instruments and derivative asset The carrying value of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and debt (See Notes 9 & 10) approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s long-term convertible debt is also stated at fair value since the stated rate of interest approximates market rates. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable. The following table presents the Company’s financial instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s balance sheets on a recurring basis, and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2020: The below table presents the change in the fair value of the derivative asset and investment in debt security during the year ended September 30, 2020: Income taxes The Company’s calculation of its tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. The Company recognizes tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on management’s estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes will be required. The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2020 and 2019. Deferred income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Temporary differences arise from net operating losses, differences in depreciation methods of archived images, and property and equipment, stock-based and other compensation, and other accrued expenses. A valuation allowance is established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S., or the various state jurisdictions, may be materially different from management’s estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. Interest and penalties are included in tax expense. The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operation in the provision for income taxes. As of September 30, 2020, and 2019, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations or net assets of the Company. Segment Reporting Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding the method to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company currently has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. Recently issued accounting pronouncements In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, ""Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,"" which modifies the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees to largely align it with the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for us for annual periods beginning October 1, 2019. The new standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,"" which allows for the capitalization of certain implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. ASU 2018-15 allows for either retrospective adoption or prospective adoption to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2016-02, Leases . The amendments in ASU 2016-02 to Topic 842, Leases , require lessees to recognize the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases in the statement of financial position. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP. The Company adopted the amendments to Topic 842 on October 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The Company elected the transition option issued under ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements , which allows entities to continue to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, Leases , to prior periods, including disclosure requirements. Accordingly, prior period financial results and disclosures have not been adjusted. The Company also elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitting entities to forgo reassessment of: 1) expired or existing contracts that may contain leases; 2) lease classification of expired or existing leases; and 3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company has also elected to apply the short term lease measurement and recognition exemption to leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. The most significant impact of the new standard on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements was the recognition of a right of use asset and lease liability for operating leases for which the Company is the lessee. Upon adoption of this guidance, on October 1, 2019, the Company recorded a Right of use asset and corresponding lease liability of $85,280 and $85,280, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. No cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings resulted from adoption of this guidance. The new standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The purpose of the standard is to improve the overall usefulness of fair value disclosures to financial statement users and reduce unnecessary costs to companies when preparing the disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and requires the application of the prospective method of transition (for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption) to the new disclosure requirements for (1) changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income and (2) the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 also requires prospective application to any modifications to disclosures made because of the change to the requirements for the narrative description of measurement uncertainty. The effects of all other amendments made by ASU 2018-13 must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations. In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require assets measured at amortized cost and establishes an allowance of credit losses for available for sale debt securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations. The Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 3. ACQUISITION OF GRIDFABRIC, LLC. On August 31, 2020, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with GridFabric, LLC, (“GridFabric”), and its sole member, Dupont Hale Holdings, LLC (“Seller”), whereby the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding membership units of GridFabric from the Seller (the “Transaction”) in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of cash and stock of up to $ 1,400,000 (the “Purchase Price”). The Transaction closed simultaneously with execution on August 31, 2020. As a result of the Transaction, GridFabric, an OpenADR software solutions provider, is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Purchase Price was as follows: b) $ 400,000 in cash was delivered to an independent third-party escrow where such cash is subject to offset for adjustments to the Purchase Price and indemnification purposes for a period of 12 months; c) 26,427 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $ 250,000 , were issued to the Seller (the “Shares”). The Shares are subject to certain leak-out provisions whereby the Seller may sell an amount of Shares equal to no more than ten percent (10%) of the daily dollar trading volume of the Company’s common stock on its principal market for the prior 30 days (the “Leak-Out Terms”); and d) additional shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at up to $ 750,000 , will be issuable to Seller if GridFabric achieves certain revenue and product release milestones related to the future performance of GridFabric (the “Earn-out Shares”). The Earn-Out Shares are also subject to the Leak-Out Terms. The Shares were issued at a fair market value of $ 9.46 per share . The Earn-Out Shares are accounted for as contingent consideration and the number of shares to be issued will be determined based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date such milestone event occurs. The Agreement contains standard representations, warranties, covenants, indemnification and other terms customary in similar transactions. In connection with the transaction, the Company also entered into employment relationships and non-compete agreements with GridFabric’s key employees for a period of 36 months and plans to issue future equity compensation to said employees, subject to approval of the Company’s board of directors.

On November 5, 2019, the Company entered into a binding Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with International Land Alliance, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“ILAL”), in order to lay a foundational framework where the Company will deploy its energy solutions products and services to ILAL, its energy projects, and its customers. In connection with the MOU, and in order to support the power and energy needs of ILAL’s development and construction of certain projects, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 6, 2019, with ILAL (the “SPA”). Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, ILAL sold, and the Company purchased 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price of US $ 500,000 (the “Stock Transaction”), less certain expenses and fees.

Under the terms of the promissory note, the Company received $ 150,000 and agreed to make monthly interest payments and repay the note principal 24 months from the date of issuance. On September 5, 2019, the investor extended the maturity date to September 5, 2021 and the modification was not deemed substantial. The note is secured by 15,000 shares which are held in escrow and would be issued to the note holder only in the case of an uncured default. As of September 30, 2020, the Company owed $ 0 in principal and $ 0 in accrued interest under the terms of the agreement and recorded interest expense of $ 12,426 and $ 10,096 during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. On December 5, 2017, the Company executed a 9 % secured promissory note with a face value of $ 50,000 with an investor. Under the terms of the promissory note the Company received $50,000 and agreed to make monthly interest payments and repay the note principal 24 months from the date of issuance. The note was secured by 5,000 shares which would be issued to the note holder only in the case of an uncured default. The Company repaid all principal and outstanding interest on December 5, 2019 and the 5,000 shares of common stock held as collateral were returned to treasury and cancelled on January 13, 2020. The Company recorded interest expense of $ 802 and $ 3,367 for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. On May 7, 2020, the Company applied for a loan from Celtic Bank Corporation, as lender, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) as administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the ""SBA""). On May 15, 2020, the loan was approved and the Company received the proceeds from the loan in the amount of $ 531,169 (the “PPP Loan”). The PPP Loan took the form of a promissory note issued by the Company that matures on May 7, 2022 and bears interest at a rate of 1.0 % per annum. Monthly principal and interest payments, less the amount of any potential forgiveness (discussed below), will commence on December 7, 2020. The PPP Loan provides for customary events of default, including, among others, those relating to failure to make payments thereunder. Borrower may prepay the principal of the PPP Loan at any time without incurring any prepayment penalties. The PPP Loan is non-recourse against any individual shareholder, except to the extent that such party uses the loan proceeds for an unauthorized purpose. All or a portion of the PPP Loan may be forgiven by the SBA and lender upon application by the Company and upon documentation of expenditures in accordance with the SBA requirements. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness is available for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered rent payments, and covered utilities during the applicable period beginning on the date of loan approval. For purposes of the CARES Act, payroll costs exclude compensation of an individual employee in excess of $100,000, prorated annually. Not more than 25% of the forgiven amount may be for non-payroll costs. Forgiveness is reduced if full-time headcount declines, or if salaries and wages for employees with salaries of $100,000 or less annually are reduced by more than 25% . In the event the PPP Loan, or any portion thereof, is forgiven pursuant to the PPP, the amount forgiven is applied to outstanding principal. The Company recorded interest expense of $ 2,125 and $ 0 for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Insurance financing loans On February 11, 2019, the Company executed an unsecured 5.6% installment loan with a total face value of $ 78,603 with a financial institutional to finance its insurance policies.

As of September 30, 2019, $ 17,467 in principal remained outstanding. The Company repaid all principal and outstanding interest on November 4, 2019. 10. CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE Securities Purchase Agreement – December 31, 2018 On December 31, 2018, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with an otherwise unaffiliated third-party institutional investor (the “Investor”), pursuant to which the Company issued to the Investor a Senior Secured Redeemable Convertible Debenture (the “Debenture”) in the aggregate face value of $ 5,250,000 . The note is secured by all assets of the Company. The Debenture has a maturity date of two years from the issuance date and the Company has agreed to pay compounded interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Debenture at the rate equal 7.5 % per annum. Interest is payable on the date the applicable principal is converted or on maturity. The interest must be paid in cash and, in certain circumstances, may be paid in shares of common stock. The transactions described above closed on December 31, 2018. In connection with the issuance of the Debenture and pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the Company issued to the Investor 10,000 shares of common stock and a Common Stock Purchase Warrant to acquire up to 308,333 shares of common stock for a term of three years (the “Warrant”) on a cash-only basis at an exercise price of $ 20.00 per share with respect to 125,000 Warrant Shares, $ 25.00 with respect to 100,000 Warrant Shares, $ 50.00 with respect to 50,000 Warrant Shares and $ 75.00 with respect to 33,333 Warrant Shares. The warrants and shares issued were fair valued and a debt discount of $ 4,995,000 was recorded as a result of the issuance of the warrants and shares and the recognition of a beneficial conversion feature on the Debenture. The Company also paid a $ 5,000 due diligence fee prior to receiving the funding which was also recorded as a debt discount. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the Investor agreed to tender to the Company the sum of $ 5,000,000 , of which the Company received the full amount as of the closing. Prior to the maturity date, provided that no trigger event has occurred, the Company will have the right at any time upon 30 trading days’ prior written notice, in its sole and absolute discretion, to redeem all or any portion of the Debenture then outstanding by paying to the Investor an amount equal to 140% of the of the portion of the Debenture being redeemed . The Investor may convert the Debenture into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to 95% of the mathematical average of the 5 lowest individual daily volume weighted average prices of the common stock, less $0.50 per share, during the period beginning on the issuance date and ending on the maturity date subject to certain floor price restrictions. In the event certain equity conditions exist, the Company may require that the Investor convert the Debenture. In no event shall the Debenture be allowed to affect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of Company common stock beneficially owned by the Investor and its affiliates would exceed 4.99% of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company. While the note is outstanding if Triggering Events occur the conversion rate may be decreased by 10% and the interest rate increased by 10% for each Triggering Event which may result in the issuance of additional shares. On March 4, March 13, and May 1, 2020 the Company entered into amendments (the “Amendments”) with the Investor. The Amendments amended the SPA and Debenture, as follows: On January 7, 2019, the Investor converted $ 2,500,000 in principal and $ 875,000 in interest as a conversion premium, for 178,473 shares of the Company common stock at an effective conversion price of $ 18.90 , due to a trigger event for the Company not filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 on or before December 31, 2018. On March 6, 2019, the Investor converted $ 1,000,000 in principal and $ 350,000 in interest as a conversion premium, for 71,389 shares of the Company common stock at an effective conversion price of $ 18.90 , due to a trigger event for the Company not filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 on or before December 31, 2018. On July 9, 2019, in accordance with the terms of the agreement the Investor was issued an additional 45,614 shares of common stock due to the decrease in stock price resulting in an effective conversion price of $ 15.06 .

Pursuant to the first closing of the Agreement, which occurred on April 18, 2019, the Investor agreed to tender to the Company the sum of $ 10,000,000 , for the Note, the Common Stock and the Warrant. No additional closings to sell the preferred stock have occurred and the Series B preferred stock was removed under the amendments to the Agreement discussed below. The Note has a maturity date of two years from the issuance date and the Company has agreed to pay compounded interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Note at the rate equal 7.5 % per annum. Interest is payable on the date the applicable principal is converted or on maturity. The interest must be paid in cash and, in certain circumstances, may be paid in shares of common stock. Prior to the maturity date, provided that no trigger event has occurred, the Company will have the right at any time upon 30 trading days’ prior written notice, in its sole and absolute discretion, to redeem all or any portion of the Note then outstanding by paying to the Investor an amount equal to 145% of the of the portion of the Note being redeemed. The Investor may convert the Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to 90% of the mathematical average of the 5 lowest individual daily volume weighted average prices of the common stock, less $0.75 per share, during the period beginning on the issuance date and ending on the maturity date subject to certain floor price restrictions. In the event certain equity conditions exist, the Company may require that the Investor convert the Note. In no event shall the Note be allowed to effect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of Company common stock beneficially owned by the Investor and its affiliates would exceed 4.99% of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Company. While the Note is outstanding if Triggering Events occur the conversion rate may be decreased by 10% and the interest rate increased by 10% for each Triggering Event which may result in the issuance of additional shares. On March 4, March 13, and May 1, 2020 the Company entered into amendments (the “Amendments”) with the Investor. The Amendments amended the Agreement and Note, as follows: During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Investor converted $ 10,750,000 in principal and $ 1,612,500 in interest, for 8,241,665 shares of the Company common stock at an effective conversion price of $ 1.50 .

LEASES On October 1, 2019, the Company adopted the amendments to ASC 842, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. The Company adopted the new lease guidance using the modified retrospective approach and elected the transition option issued under ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements, allowing entities to continue to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, Leases, to prior periods, including disclosure requirements. Accordingly, prior period financial results and disclosures have not been adjusted. The Company has operating leases under which it leases its branch offices and corporate headquarters, one of which is with a related party. Upon adoption of the new lease guidance, on October 1, 2019, the Company recorded a right of use asset and corresponding lease liability of $ 85,280 and $ 85,280 , respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. As of September 30, 2020, the Company's operating lease right of use asset and operating lease liability totaled $ 40,711 and $ 41,294 , respectively. A weighted average discount rate of 10 % was used in the measurement of the right of use asset and lease liability as of October 1, 2019. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company's incremental collateralized borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of lease payments. This rate gives consideration to the applicable Company collateralized borrowing rates and is based on the information available at the commencement date. The Company has elected to apply the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption to leases with an initial term of 12 months or less; therefore, these leases are not recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, but rather, lease expense is recognized over the lease term on a straight-line basis. The Company's leases have remaining lease terms between one year to two years , with a weighted average lease term of 0.4 years at September 30, 2020. Some leases include multiple year renewal options. The Company’s decision to exercise these renewal options is based on an assessment of its current business needs and market factors at the time of the renewal. Currently, the Company has no leases for which the option to renew is reasonably certain and therefore, options to renew were not factored into the calculation of its right of use asset and lease liability as of October 1, 2019. The following is a schedule of the Company's operating lease liabilities by contractual maturity as of September 30, 2020: Total operating lease costs of $ 117,223 and $ 76,220 the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were included as part of administrative expense. 12.

(See Note 20 for additional details) The Plan allows the Company to grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation right, or restricted stock. The incentive stock options are exercisable for up to ten years, at an option price per share not less than the fair market value on the date the option is granted. The incentive stock options are limited to persons who are regular full-time employees of the Company at the date of the grant of the option. Non-qualified options may be granted to any person, including, but not limited to, employees, independent agents, consultants and attorneys, who the Company’s Board believes have contributed, or will contribute, to the success of the Company. Non-qualified options may be issued at option prices of less than fair market value on the date of grant and may be exercisable for up to ten years from date of grant. The option vesting schedule for options granted is determined by the Board of Directors at the time of the grant. The Plan provides for accelerated vesting of unvested options if there is a change in control, as defined in the Plan. The following is a summary of stock option activity during the years ended September 30, 2020 and year ended September 30, 2019. As of September 30, 2020, there are options exercisable to purchase 225,451 shares of common stock in the Company and 52,497 unvested options outstanding that cannot be exercised until vesting conditions are met.

INCOME TAXES The Company provides for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. FASB ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently. FASB ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the Company’s opinion, it is uncertain whether they will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset. Accordingly, a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been recorded. The total deferred tax asset is approximately $ 11.0 million as of September 30, 2020 which is calculated by multiplying a 21 % estimated tax rate by the cumulative net operating loss (NOL) of approximately $ 52.5 million. Due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 2017, we have calculated our deferred tax assets using an estimated corporate tax rate of 21 % . US Tax codes and laws may be subject to further reform or adjustment which may have a material impact to the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. The significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: As of September 30, 2020, and 2019, the Company had gross federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 52.5 million and $ 42.3 million, respectively. The Company plans to file its U.S. federal return for the year ended September 30, 2020 upon the issuance of this filing. Upon filing of the tax return for the year ended September 30, 2020 the actual deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance available to the Company may differ from management’s estimates. The tax years 2015-2019 remained open to examination for federal income tax purposes by the major tax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. No tax returns are currently under examination by any tax authorities. 17.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), with assistance from other members of management, has reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2020 and, based on his evaluation, has concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, described below. MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We identified a material weakness in the design of internal control related to the following areas: (i) Inadequate controls over information technology. This material weakness did not result in any identified material misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Based on this material weakness, management concluded that at September 30, 2020, internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Following identification of the material weakness and prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed substantive procedures for the year ended September 30, 2020. Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our CEO and CFO has certified that, based on their knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of CleanSpark as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-K. MaloneBailey, LLP has issued an unqualified opinion on our financial statements, which appears on page F-1. REMEDIATION Management has implemented and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: adopting a different financial reporting software that has increased controls built into the system functionality which began on the first day of fiscal 2021. We believe that this action will remediate the material weakness, once management has performed its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting including the remedial measures described above. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Except for the material weakness identified as of September 30, 2020, and except for the remedial measures described above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON INTERNAL CONTROLS Notwithstanding the foregoing, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. Limitations inherent in any control system include the following: Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. ATTESTATION REPORT OF THE REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm on the Company’s internal controls as the Company is a non-accelerated filer and is thus not required to provide such a report.

Business Organization Overview CleanSpark, Inc. (“CleanSpark”, “we”, “our”, the ""Company"") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 15, 1987, as SmartData Corporation. SmartData conducted a 504-public offering in the State of Nevada in December 1987, and began trading publicly in January 1988. Due to a series of unfortunate events, including the untimely death of the founding CEO, SmartData discontinued active business operations in 1992. On March 25, 2014, we began operations in the alternative energy sector. In December 2014, the Company changed its name to Stratean Inc. through a short-form merger in order to better reflect its business plan. On July 1, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, as amended (the “Purchase Agreement”), with CleanSpark Holdings LLC, CleanSpark LLC, CleanSpark Technologies LLC and Specialized Energy Solutions, Inc. (together, the “Seller”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired CleanSpark, LLC and all the assets related to the Seller and its line of business and assumed $200,000 in liabilities. In October 2016, the Company changed its name to CleanSpark, Inc. through a short-form merger in order to better reflect the brand identity. On January 22, 2019, CleanSpark entered into an Agreement with Pioneer Critical Power, Inc., whereby it acquired certain intellectual property assets and a customer list. As consideration the Company issued to its sole shareholder (i) 175,000 of the common stock of CleanSpark, (ii) a five-year warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of CleanSpark common stock at an exercise price of $16.00 per share, and (iii) a five-year warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of CleanSpark common stock at an exercise price of $20.00 per share. As a result of the transaction Pioneer Critical Power Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of CleanSpark Inc. On February 1, 2019, Pioneer Critical Power, Inc. was renamed to CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc. On December 10, 2019, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) approved the Company’s 1:10 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock. The reverse stock split took effect on December 11, 2019. Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts and share information in this annual report and included in the audited financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, have been adjusted for the stock split as if such stock split occurred on the first day of the first period presented. Our Business We are in the business of providing advanced energy software and control technology that enables a plug-and-play enterprise solution to modern energy challenges. Our services consist of intelligent energy monitoring and controls, microgrid design and engineering and consulting services. Our software allows energy users to obtain resiliency and economic optimization. Our software is uniquely capable of enabling a microgrid to be scaled to the user's specific needs and can be widely implemented across commercial, industrial, military and municipal deployment. Integral to our business is our mPulse and mVSO software platforms (the “Platforms”). When the Platforms are implemented on a customer’s power system, they are able to control the distributed energy resources on site to provide secure, sustainable energy often at significant cost savings for our energy customers. The Platforms allows customers to efficiently manage renewable energy generation, other distributed energy generation technologies including energy generation assets, energy storage assets, and energy consumption assets. By having autonomous control over the distributed facets of energy usage and energy storage, customers are able to reduce their dependency on utilities, thereby keeping energy costs relatively constant over time. The overall aim is to transform energy consumers into energy producers by supplying power that anticipates their routine instead of interrupting it. We also own patented gasification technologies. Our technology converts any organic material into SynGas. SynGas can be used as clean, renewable, environmentally friendly, warming fuel for power plants, motor vehicles, and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether). As previously disclosed, we plan to continue our focus on the Distributed energy and microgrid side of the business in 2020, as opposed to expending significant efforts on the Gasifier side of the business. We plan to continue our efforts to better our technology, service existing customers and market our System (defined below) to prospective clients. We feel that this focus would provide the best opportunity for our shareholders. Lines of Business Through CleanSpark, LLC, the Company provides microgrid solutions to military, commercial and residential properties. The services offered consist of, microgrid design and engineering, project development consulting services. The work is performed under fixed price bid contracts and negotiated price contracts. Through CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc., the Company provides custom hardware solutions for distributed energy systems that serve military and commercial residential properties. The equipment is generally sold under negotiated fixed price contracts. Our Distributed Energy Management Business Integral to our business is our Distributed Energy Management Business (the “DER Business”). The main assets of our DER Business include our propriety software systems (“Systems”) and also our engineering and methodology trade secrets. The Distributed Energy systems and Microgrids that utilize our Systems are capable of providing secure, sustainable energy with significant cost savings for its energy customers. The Systems allows customers to design, engineer, and then efficiently manage renewable energy generation, storage and consumption. By having autonomous control over the multiple facets of energy usage and storage, customers are able to reduce their dependency on utilities, thereby keeping energy costs relatively constant over time. The overall aim is to transform energy consumers into intelligent energy producers by supplying and managing power in a manner that anticipates their routine instead of interrupting it. Around the world, the aging grid is becoming unstable and unreliable due to increases in loads and lack of new large-scale generation facilities. This inherent instability is compounded by the push to integrate a growing number and variety of renewable but intermittent energy generators and advanced technologies into outdated electrical systems. Simultaneously, defense installations, industrial complexes, communities, and campuses across the world are turning to virtual power plants and microgrids as a means to decrease their reliance from the grid, reduce utility costs, utilize cleaner power, and enhance energy security and surety. The convergence of these factors is creating a “perfect storm” in the power supply optimization and energy management arena. Efficiently building and operating the distributed energy management systems and microgrids of tomorrow, while maximizing the use of sustainable energy to produce affordable, stable, predictable, and reliable power on a large scale, is a significant opportunity that first-movers can leverage to capture a large share of this emerging global industry. A microgrid is comprised of any number of generation, energy storage, and smart distribution assets that serve a single or multiple loads, both connected to the utility grid and separate from the utility grid “islanded.” In the past, distributed energy management systems and microgrids have consisted of off-grid generators organized with controls to provide power where utility lines cannot run. Today, modern distributed energy management systems and microgrids integrate renewable energy generation systems (REGS) with advanced energy storage devices and interoperate with the local utility grid. Advanced autonomous cyber-secure microgrids controls relay information between intelligent hardware and localized servers to make decisions in real-time that deliver optimum power where it is needed, when it is needed. Our Systems create an integrated distributed energy management control platform that seamlessly integrates all forms of energy generation with energy storage devices and controls facility loads to provide energy security in real time free of cyber threats. Able to interoperate with the local utility grid, the Systems bring users the ability to choose when to buy or sell power to and from the grid, enabling what we believe is the most cost-effective power solution that exists on the current market. Our Systems are ideal for commercial, industrial, mining, defense, campus and residential users and ranges in size from 4KW to 100MW and beyond and can deliver power at or below the current cost of utility power. Our services consist of distributed energy microgrid system engineering and design, and project consulting services. The work is performed under fixed price bid contracts and negotiated price contracts. mPulse Software Suite mPulse is a modular platform that enables fine-grained control of a Microgrid based on customer operational goals, equipment and forecasts of load and generation. mPulse performs high-frequency calculations, threshold-based alarming, execution of domain-specific business rules, internal and external health monitoring, historical data persistence, and system-to-operator notifications. The modular design increases system flexibility and extensibility. In addition, the deployment of the mPulse system follows a security-conscious posture by deploying hardware-based firewalls as well as encryption across communication channels. mPulse allows configuration for site-specific equipment and operation and provides a clean, informative user interface to allow customers to monitor and analyze the data streams that describe how their microgrid is operating. mPulse supports our innovative fractal approach to microgrid design, which enables multiple microgrids on a single site to interact in a number of different ways, including as peers, in a parent-child relationship, and in parallel or completely disconnected. Each grid can have different operational objectives, and those operational objectives can change over time. Any microgrid can be islanded from the rest of the microgrid as well as the larger utility grid. The mPulse software can control the workflow required in both the islanding steps as well as the reconnecting steps of this maneuver and coordinate connected equipment such that connections are only made when it is safe to do so. Microgrid Value Stream Optimizer (mVSO) The Microgrid Value Stream Optimizer (mVSO) tool provides a robust distributed energy and microgrid system modeling solution. mVSO takes utility rate data and load data for a customer site and helps automate the sizing and analysis of potential microgrid solutions as well as providing a financial analysis around each grid configuration. mVSO uses historical data to generate projected energy generation assets and models how storage responds to varying operational modes and command logics based upon predicted generation and load curves. mVSO analyzes multiple equipment combinations and operational situations to determine the optimal configuration for a site based on the financials, equipment outlay, utility cost savings, etc., to arrive at payback and IRR values. This ultimately provides the user with data to design a distributed energy and/or microgrid system that will meet the customers’ performance benchmarks. Positioning When mPulse originally was developed, a main focus of the platform and the industry was resiliency of microgrid operation, specifically in military contexts. Since that time, the microgrid landscape has continued to evolve, and there is growing opportunity within the commercial and industrial space as the markets in these spaces desire microgrids capable of obtaining the highest economic advantage. Further, this growing focus on economic advantage is in line with the continued market evolution toward an open energy market at regional levels. We want to be well positioned to enter into this market at each step of its availability, from responding to demand response requests all the way through participating in ancillary grid service markets and fully open transactive energy markets as regulation matures. To position ourselves, the mPulse platform implements internal markets at each level of the system. In these internal markets, energy producing assets are modeled as sellers, and energy consuming assets are modeled as buyers, with the market playing matchmaker between the two and virtually “selling” available energy to the highest bidder, thereby satisfying the energy loads at the highest economic advantage for both participants at any given moment. The internal energy market running at our customers’ sites take daily feeds of production and load forecasts from the platform to set up the daily market parameters, then ingest a stream of current positions of both buyers and sellers as well as their individual pricing information, which is calculated based on the details of the energy rate under which those consumers operate. Consumers bid into the market along the schedule of the specific rate structure under which those loads operate, with bids including the calculated value of energy and power based on that rate and the predicted total use and power profile during the time period of that bid. Based on the predicted generation profile and the other active bids currently being satisfied, the market either fills or cannot fill the newly received bid, and based on the market’s feedback, the consumer’s operation mode and setpoint will change, which will determine the actual control commands sent to related equipment. This market scenario is mirrored at every level, from an individual node potentially consisting of only one producer and one consumer (power source and meter, respectively), to a higher-level node, in which other nodes participate as either net producers or net consumers, to the site level, and even up to regional level, when sites are allowed to participate in the market directly. At each level, details of the level below are aggregated and abstracted away, so each level operates in a simple and self-similar way, mirroring the physical construction of the FractalGrid. These markets shine in optimization scenarios, especially in times of just enough supply or even slight scarcity, which generally allows the system to reap the maximum economic value for our customers even in the case of undersized grids. In addition, this flexibility allows for ease of integration for new market participants at each level as regulation matures to support further Demand Response programs, ancillary service markets, and eventually peer-to-peer transactive energy. Quality We employ a quality-first mindset in all aspects of our software design. From a software architecture point of view, this translates in designing for the maintainability, extensibility, scalability, availability, accessibility, and deployability of the system. This design plan paired with our design and engineering methods and experience are intended to help keep us on the leading edge of the microgrid industry. Patent Protection We were granted a United States Patents on April 10, 2018 protecting our software systems. The patent, ""Establishing Communication and Power Sharing Links Between Components of a Distributed Energy System, US 9,941, 696 B2,"" is a patent that specifically addresses our engineering and data-analytics technologies, processes and procedures. The patent covers our ability to receive data from a plurality of sources within a microgrid, which is then analyzed to forecast power needs across the microgrid, or a combination of multiple 'fractal' microgrids, and then determining whether or when to share power with the requesting module.

In connection with the Stock Transaction, ILAL will issue 350,000 shares of its common stock to the Company as commitment shares. ILAL may issue additional shares of its common stock to the Company if certain conditions are not satisfied. Our Gasifier Business We own Patent Nos. 9,890,340B2, 9,359,567, 8,518,133 8,105,401 and 8,347,829 protecting our gasification technology and process for using feedstock comprising gaseous fuel. Our technology is capable of converting any organic material into SynGas. SynGas can be used as clean, renewable, environmentally friendly, warming fuel for power plants, motor vehicles, and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether). Our process involves the grinding, drying, separating, mixing, and then pelletizing of solid waste. These pellets constitute the feedstock for the Gasifier. Gasifying the pellets produces SynGas. SynGas can be converted into multiple forms of energy including motor vehicle and jet fuels. The SynGas produced is sufficently clean that it generally does not require hot-gas cleanup. SynGas is mostly hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide are primary building blocks for fuels and chemicals. SynGas is a clean burning fuel suitable for use in duel-fuel diesel engines, gas turbines, and steam boilers. As discussed above, we do not anticipate deploying significant resources on the gasification business at this time. As opportunities arise we intend to utilize the gasification assets and intellectual properties through licensing or sales agreements. The technologies and prototype will need to undergo additional clinical lab testing to further establish its capability of producing large volumes of clean, renewable energy from any carbon compound (Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Coal, Sewage Sludge) into clean Synthesis Gas. Our Gasifier is still under development and a commercially viable Gasifier is not expected to be sellable until we are able to expend additional resources on its testing and development. In December of 2014, we executed an agreement with a third party to independently test our production model prototype. The third party was engaged to independently test the Gasifer's performance and certify the results of its performance. Upon completion of the testing, an initial white paper was published outlining the results and suggested improvements. We anticipate that the cost to complete these improvements would b e between $250,000 and $500,000. Upon completion of the improvements, we would conduct an extended test run with an independent third party to verify the results needed to prove its commercial viability, at which time we would begin to actively market our Gasifier units. We have not engaged in any significant negotiations to sell or license our Gasifier products to any major customers. Competition We face significant competition in the alternative energy and microgrid markets. Some of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources. Factors that could affect our ability increase sales of our System may include resource limitations, available information and our standards established for projected return on investment. Distributed Energy Management Business Competition Our DER Business and software platforms are set up to compete against larger companies. Our integrated microgrid control platform seamlessly integrates energy generation with energy storage devices and controls facility loads to provide energy security in real time. The systems are able to interoperate with the local utility grid and allows users the ability to obtain the most cost-effective power for a facility. The systems are technology agnostic and can incorporate into multiple vendors and manufacturers products and legacy systems. The systems are ideal for commercial, industrial, mining, defense, campus and community users ranging from 4 kw to 100 MW and beyond and can deliver power at or below the current cost of utility power. All of these attributes contribute to our ability to compete with the larger, more established competitors that have rely on their own manufactured products and hardware solutions. Distributed Energy and Microgrid control technologies are new to the market and can be deployed in various formats. Eight technologies that are predominantly used in commercial applications and/or have been extensively studied are: These current technologies of our competitors have a number of inherent problems: The principal advantages of our System are: Gasifier business competition Our Gasifier system is set up to compete against larger gasification projects. Our modular concept allows for parallel processing so a facility could be easily expanded or reduced without risk or changing the basic structure by simply adding or removing module units; it also allows for multiple end product processing, producing electricity, ethanol, and fuels simultaneously, and for universal parts which reduces maintenance costs. This design factor solves repair and maintenance problems by simply shutting down the unit(s) to be repaired and bringing the reserve unit(s) online. All of these attributes contribute to our ability to compete with the larger, more established competitors that have large systems that require significant downtime for maintenance and repair. Gasification technologies can incorporate any one of a number of Gasifiers. Eight gasification technologies that are predominantly used in commercial applications and/or have been extensively studied are: These current technologies of our competitors have a number of inherent problems: The principal advantages of our Gasifier are: Intellectual Property In relation to our microgrid business, we own the following patents: Patent No. 9,941,696 B2 ""Establishing Communication and Power Sharing Links Between Components of a Distributed Energy System, awarded April 10, 2018, is a revolutionary patent that specifically addresses CleanSpark's engineering and data-analytics technologies, processes and procedures. The patent covers CleanSpark's ability to receive data from a plurality of sources within a microgrid, which is then analyzed to forecast power needs across the microgrid, or a combination of multiple 'fractal' microgrids, and then determining whether or when to share power with the requesting module. In relation to our Gasifier business, we own the following patents: Patent No. 9,359,567 ‘Gasification Method Using Feedstock Comprising Gaseous Fuels’; Patent No. 8,518,133 ‘Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method’; and Patent No. 8,105,401 ‘Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method.’ ; Patent No. 8,347,829 Electrolytic Reactor and Related Methods for Supplementing the Air Intake of an Internal Combustion Engine. The second Patent, ""Parallel Path Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method, US 9,890, 340 B2"", awarded February 13, 2018, further enhances CleanSpark's patent portfolio surrounding its proprietary gasification and waste-to-energy technologies. Government Regulation We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. It is anticipated that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with existing federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and human health will not have a material effect upon us, our capital expenditures, or earnings. We cannot predict what effect additional regulation or legislation, enforcement policies thereunder and claims for damages for injuries to property, employees, other persons and the environment resulting from our operations. Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by state and federal authorities including the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). This regulation has not increased the cost of planning, designing and operating to date. Although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of these operations, there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities, including criminal penalties, will not be incurred. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, including stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages for injuries to property or persons resulting from our activities could result in substantial costs and liabilities. In the conduct of our activities, our operations will be subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and similar state statutes require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in its operations. Certain of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in OSHA workplace standards. Other than the above regulations and maintaining our good standing in the State of Nevada, complying with applicable local business licensing requirements, complying with all state and federal tax requirements, preparing our periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and complying with other applicable securities laws, rules, and regulations, we do not believe that existing or probably governmental regulations will have a material effect on our operations. We do not currently require the approval of any governmental agency or affiliated program for our operations. Employees, Consultants and Contractors We currently have 20 employees, and also contract the services of consultants in the various areas of expertise as required. The way in which our business currently operates is as follows: Our Chief Executive Officer, Zachary K. Bradford , currently manages our day-to-day operations. He is responsible for the negotiation of contracts, oversees the design, marketing and implementation of the products and processes, and manages licenses, patents, and other intangible assets. In addition to daily management tasks, Mr. Bradford also researches financing and potential investors. Our Chief Financial Officer, Lori Love , is responsible for implementing our strategic goals and objectives. She is also in charge of managing our financial risks, financial planning, accounting records, SEC filings, reviewing financial data, reporting financial performance, preparing budgets, and monitoring expenditures and costs. Our Chief Operating Officer, Anthony Vastola , is responsible for implementing and overseeing our general operations, sales efforts and research and development activities. Our Chief Innovation Officer, Bryan Huber, is responsible for identifying and developing new products, services and business models. In addition, he is responsible for creating new organizational capabilities to provide product differentiation and build long term value. Our Chief Technology Officer, Amanda Kabak, is responsible for outlining the Company’s technological vision, implementation of technology strategies and ensuring technology resources are aligned with the company’s business needs. In addition, she is responsible for determining the feasibility and marketability of our technology and future software technologies that we may acquire. The amount of time devoted to us currently by officers may be limited by the resources we have available. However, we feel the time devoted to operations is enough to cover our current operational requirements. Company Website We maintain a corporate Internet website at: www.cleanspark.com The contents of this website are not incorporated in or otherwise to be regarded as part of this Annual Report. We file reports with the SEC which are available on our website free of charge. These reports include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, “Section 16” filings on Form 3, Form 4, and Form 5, and other related filings, each of which is provided on our website as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file such materials with or furnish them to the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, including the Company. Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this report. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize, that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Risks Related to Our Business We lack an established operating history and have incurred losses in prior periods, expect to incur losses in the future and we can give no assurance that our operations will result in profits. We have a limited operating history that makes it difficult to evaluate our business. Historical sales pertaining to our System have been in low volume, and we cannot say with certainty when we will begin to achieve profitability. We have not sold any of our Gasifiers. Since inception, we have sustained $93,056,463 in cumulative net losses and we had a net loss for the year ended September 30, 2019 of $26,116,932. We expect to have operating losses at least until such time as we have developed a substantial and stable revenue base. We cannot assure you that we can develop a substantial and stable revenue base or achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Although we have obtained sufficient funding for the foreseeable future, if we do not obtain increased revenues in 2020, we may have to seek additional financing or scale back or cease our activities , which may significantly harm our chances of success. Because we currently operate at a loss, we are dependent on generating additional revenue in the coming year. Most of our financing in 2019 was from the issuance of convertible notes along with some funding from the sale of our common stock and related party advances. We obtained approximately $15,000,000 in connection with the sale of two secured convertible promissory notes. While this financing is expected to carry us through 2020, we need to generate cashflows from revenues totaling $2,000,000 to $4,000,000 to support our current operations or we may need a similar amount in additional financing in 2021. As explained in this annual report, these cashflows are needed to increase our sales and marketing efforts, for continued upgrades to our software, and for working capital. Our future success is difficult to predict because we operate in emerging and evolving markets, and the industries in which we compete are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles. The renewable energy, microgrid and related industries are emerging and evolving markets which may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and which may lead to period to period variability in our operating results. Our products and services are based on unique technology which we believe offers significant advantages to our customers, but the markets we serve are in a relatively early stage of development and it is uncertain how rapidly they will develop. It is also uncertain whether our products will achieve high levels of demand and acceptance as these markets grow. If companies in the industries we serve do not perceive or value the benefits of our technologies and products, or if they are unwilling to adopt our products as alternatives to traditional power solutions, the market for our products and services may not develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, which could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. As a supplier to the renewable energy, microgrid and related industries, we may be subject to business cycles. The timing, length, and volatility of these business cycles may be difficult to predict. These industries may be cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers’ products, inventory levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital. These changes may affect the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology, and affect our orders, net sales, operating expenses, and net income. In addition, we may not be able to respond adequately or quickly to the declines in demand by reducing our costs. To meet rapidly changing demand in each of the industries we serve, we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity. During periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, effectively manage our supply chain, and motivate and retain key employees. During periods of increasing demand, we must have sufficient inventory to fulfill customer orders, effectively manage our supply chain, and attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned within a business cycle, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The industries in which we compete are highly competitive and we may be unable to successfully compete to survive. We compete in the market for renewable energy products and microgrid technology and associated services that is intensely competitive. Evolving industry standards, rapid price changes and product obsolescence also impact the market. Our competitors include many domestic and foreign companies, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. Our current competitors or new market entrants could introduce new or enhanced technologies, products or services with features that render our technologies, products or services obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. Our success will be dependent upon our ability to develop products that are superior to existing products and products introduced in the future, and which are cost effective. In addition, we may be required to continually enhance any products that are developed as well as introduce new products that keep pace with technological change and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of the marketplace. Even if our current technologies prove to be commercially feasible, there is extensive research and development being conducted on alternative energy sources that may render our technologies and protocols obsolete or otherwise non-competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep pace with the technological demands of the marketplace or successfully develop products that will succeed in the marketplace. As a small company, we will be at a competitive disadvantage to most of our competitors, which include larger, established companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other resources than us. There can be no assurance that we will have the capital resources available to undertake the research that may be necessary to upgrade our equipment or develop new devices to meet the efficiencies of changing technologies. Our inability to adapt to technological change could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. To date we have had thirty-four customers for our Microgrid services, System, and Construction Contracts and none for our Gasifiers and we cannot assure you that our customer base will increase. We had revenue from twenty customers in our fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. We cannot assure you that our customer base will expand or that any decline in net revenue attributable to customer losses will be replaced in a timely manner. If we fail to commercialize our products and services and increase our customer base, our business will fail. Product development is an inherently uncertain process, and we may encounter unanticipated development challenges and may not be able to meet our product development and commercialization milestones. Product development and testing may be subject to unanticipated and significant delays, expenses and technical or other problems. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve our milestones within our planned timeframe or ever. We develop prototypes of planned products prior to the full commercialization of these products. We cannot predict whether prototypes of future products will achieve results consistent with our expectations. A prototype could cost significantly more than expected or the prototype design and construction process could uncover problems that are not consistent with our expectations. Prototypes of emerging products are a material part of our business plan, and if they are not proven to be successful, our business and prospects could be harmed. More generally, the commercialization of our products may also be adversely affected by many factors not within our control, including: Accordingly, we cannot predict that our products will be accepted on a scale sufficient to support development of mass markets for them. We rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our technology, and enforcing those rights could disrupt our business operation and divert precious resources that could ultimately harm our future prospects. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and procedures and patents to protect our proprietary technologies. In relation to our microgrid business, we own the following patents: Patent No. 9,941,696 B2 ""Establishing Communication and Power Sharing Links Between Components of a Distributed Energy System, awarded April 10, 2018, The patent covers CleanSpark's ability to receive data from a plurality of sources within a microgrid, which is then analyzed to forecast power needs across the microgrid, or a combination of multiple 'fractal' microgrids, and then determining whether or when to share power with the requesting module. We also own patent numbers 8,518,133 and 8,105,401 ‘Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method'’ and patent number 9,359,567 ‘Gasification Method Using Feedstock Comprising Gaseous Fuel’– which covers our Gasifier technology. We also own patent number 8,342,829 entitled ‘Electrolytic Reactor and Related Methods for Supplementing the Air Intake of an Internal Combustion Engine.’ The claims contained in any patent may not provide adequate protection for our products and technology. In the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know-how. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to this technology to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If a dispute arises concerning our technology, we could become involved in litigation that might involve substantial cost. Litigation could divert substantial management attention away from our operations and into efforts to enforce our patents, protect our trade secrets or know-how or determine the scope of the proprietary rights of others. If a proceeding resulted in adverse findings, we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties. We might also be required to seek licenses from third parties to manufacture or sell our products. Our ability to manufacture and sell our products may also be adversely affected by other unforeseen factors relating to the proceeding or its outcome. As we continue to grow and to develop our intellectual property, we could attract threats from patent monetization firms or competitors alleging infringement of intellectual property rights. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. If we do not prevail in this type of litigation, we may be required to: pay monetary damages; stop commercial activities relating to our product; obtain one or more licenses in order to secure the rights to continue manufacturing or marketing certain products; or attempt to compete in the market with substantially similar products. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue some of our operations. A material part of our success will depend on our ability to manage our suppliers and contract manufacturers. Our failure to manage our suppliers and contract manufacturers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers. We rely upon suppliers to provide the components necessary to build our products and on contract manufacturers to procure components and assemble our products. There can be no assurance that key suppliers and contract manufacturers will provide components or products in a timely and cost efficient manner or otherwise meet our needs and expectations. Our ability to manage such relationships and timely replace suppliers and contract manufacturers, if necessary, is critical to our success. Our failure to timely replace our contract manufacturers and suppliers, should that become necessary, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers. If we are the subject of future product defect or liability suits, our business will likely fail. In the course of our planned operations, we may become subject to legal actions based on a claim that our products are defective in workmanship or have caused personal or other injuries. We currently maintain liability insurance but there can be no guarantee that such coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims. Moreover, even if we are able to maintain sufficient insurance coverage in the future, any successful claim could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be exposed to lawsuits and other claims if our products malfunction, which could increase our expenses, harm our reputation and prevent us from growing our business. Any liability for damages resulting from malfunctions of our products could be substantial, increase our expenses and prevent us from growing or continuing our business. Potential customers may rely on our products for critical needs and a malfunction of our products could result in warranty claims or other product liability. In addition, a well-publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect the market’s perception of our products. This could result in a decline in demand for our products, which would reduce revenue and harm our business. Further, since our products are used in systems that are made up on components made by other manufacturers, we may be subject to product liability claims even if our products do not malfunction. Any failure by management to properly manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. If our business develops as expected, we anticipate that we will grow rapidly in the near future. Our failure to properly manage our expected rapid growth could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain key personnel. Our expansion could also place significant demands on our management, operations, systems, accounting, internal controls and financial resources. If we experience difficulties in any of these areas, we may not be able to expand our business successfully or effectively manage our growth. Any failure by management to manage growth and to respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The lack of management experience in the renewable energy and microgrid industries could adversely affect our company. Some members of management and the board of directors may not have prior experience in the energy industry. Some members do, however, have extensive work experience in the reclamation, environmental industries, energy industries, financial/accounting industries, and business management. The lack of experience in the alternative energy industry may impair our managements’ and directors’ ability to evaluate and make decisions involving our current operations and any future projects we may undertake in the alternative energy industry. Such impairment and lack of experience could adversely affect our business, financial condition and future operations. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled experts and workers our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected and our costs may increase. Our rate of growth will be confined by resource limitations as competitors and customers compete for increasingly scarce resources. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of affordable trained experts that can execute our operational strategy. The demand for trained software engineers, electrical engineers and other skilled workers is currently high. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected and the costs of performing our existing and future projects may increase, which may adversely impact our margins. We have engaged in and may engage in acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and reduce our financial resources. We have been involved in significant acquisitions in our lifespan. In the future, we may enter into transactions to acquire other businesses, products or technologies. If we do identify suitable candidates, we may not be able to make such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Any acquisitions we have made or plan to make may not strengthen our competitive position, and these transactions may be viewed negatively by customers or investors. We have and may decide in the future to incur debt in connection with an acquisition or issue our common stock or other securities to the stockholders of the acquired company, which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. We could incur losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of the acquired business that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel, technologies and operations into our existing business in an effective, timely and non-disruptive manner. Acquisitions may also divert management from day-to-day responsibilities, increase our expenses and reduce our cash available for operations and other uses. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that the acquisition we have engaged in or any such future transactions might have on our operating results. Our business is substantially dependent on utility rate structures and government incentive programs that encourage the use of alternative energy sources. The reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for energy-related technologies would harm our business. We believe that near-term growth of energy-related technologies, including power conversion technology, relies partly on the availability and size of government and economic incentives and grants (including, but not limited to, the U.S. Investment Tax Credit and various state and local incentive programs). These incentive programs could be challenged by utility companies, or for other reasons found to be unconstitutional, and/or could be reduced or discontinued for other reasons. The reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives could harm our business. A combination of utility rate structures and government subsidies that encourage the use of alternative energy sources is a primary driver of demand for our products. For example, public utilities are often allowed to collect demand charges on commercial and industrial customers in addition to traditional usage charges. In addition, the federal government and many states encourage the use of alternative energy sources through a combination of direct subsidies and tariff incentives such as net metering for users that use alternative energy sources such as solar power. California also encourages alternative energy technology through its Self-Generation Incentive Program, or SGIP, which offers rebates for businesses and consumers who adopt certain new technologies. Other states have similar incentives and mandates which encourage the adoption of alternative energy sources. Notwithstanding the adoption of other incentive programs, we expect that California will be the most significant market for the sale of our products in the near term. Should California or another state in which we derive a substantial portion of our product revenues in the future change its utility rate structure or eliminate or significantly reduce its incentive programs, demand for our products could be substantially affected, which would adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and operating results. Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. We may seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: Acquisitions may also cause us to: Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisition will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate an acquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre–acquisition due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products or the acquired business. Risks Related to Our Securities If a market for our common stock does not develop, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares. Our common stock is quoted under the symbol “CLSK” on the OTCQB operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc., an electronic inter-dealer quotation medium for equity securities. Our market currently has limited liquidity and trading activity . There can be no assurance that our trading market liquidity will increase of that it will be sustained at its current levels . Our securities are somewhat thinly traded. Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of our common stock without significantly depressing the value of the stock. Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could continue to result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock. Our common stock price may be volatile and could fluctuate widely in price, which could result in substantial losses for investors. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: Because we have limited revenues to date, you should consider any one of these factors to be material. Our stock price may fluctuate widely as a result of any of the above. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have the right to issue shares of preferred stock. If we were to issue preferred stock, it is likely to have rights, preferences and privileges that may adversely affect the common stock. We are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time-to-time by our board of directors. Our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix for any series the dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights, and other rights, preferences and privileges for the preferred stock. We currently have 1,750,000 shares of our series A preferred stock outstanding, the features of which are contained elsewhere in this annual report. We are also authorized to issue 100,000 shares of our Series B preferred stock, the features of which are contained elsewhere in this annual report. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the preferred stock, could reduce the voting rights and powers of the common stock and the portion of our assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution in the book value per share of the common stock we are offering. The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, to the detriment of the investors in the common stock offered hereby. We cannot assure you that we will not, under certain circumstances, issue shares of our preferred stock. We have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay dividends. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to market our products and to cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, you should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock. If securities or industry analysts do not publish or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us now or in the future issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Because may be subject to the “Penny Stock” rules, the level of trading activity in our stock may be reduced. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define ""penny stock"" to be any listed, trading equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules which may increase the difficulty Purchasers may experience in attempting to liquidate such securities. Provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions. Members of our board of directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws as authorized by the Nevada Revised Statutes. Specifically, Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a director or officer is not individually liable to the company or its shareholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer unless it is proven that (1) the director’s or officer’s act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and (2) his or her breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This provision is intended to afford directors and officers protection against and to limit their potential liability for monetary damages resulting from suits alleging a breach of the duty of care by a director or officer. Accordingly, you may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their fiduciary duty of care. In addition, our Bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if you were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses they incurred in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties Currently, we do not own any real estate. Our corporate offices are located at 70 North Main Street, Suite 105, Bountiful Utah 84010. We are currently on a month-to-month lease agreement that calls for us to make payments of $850 per month. We operate our California operations out of leased office space located at 4360 Viewridge Avenue, Suite C, San Diego, California 92123. On May 15, 2018, we executed a 37-month lease agreement, which commenced on July 1, 2018. The agreement calls for us to make payments of $4,057 in base rent per month through July 31, 2021 subject to an annual 3% rent escalation. Future minimum lease payments under the operating leases for the facilities as of September 30, 2019, are as follows: The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to litigation, claims, investigations and audits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. At this time, we are not aware of any material pending legal proceedings. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Information Our common stock is quoted under the symbol “CLSK” on the OTCQB operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. There is currently no active trading market for our securities. There is no assurance that a regular trading market will develop, or if developed, that it will be sustained. Therefore, a shareholder may be unable to resell his securities in our company. The following table sets forth the range of high and low bid quotations for our common stock for each of the periods indicated as reported by the OTCQB. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. Penny Stock The Securities Exchange Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;(b) contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of Securities' laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price;(d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;(e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and;(f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size and format, as the Commission shall require by rule or regulation. The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with; (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;(b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;(c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock if it becomes subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, because our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities. Holders of Our Common Stock As of December 13, 2019, we had 276 registered holders of record of our common stock, with others in street name. The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of the common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. Dividends There are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend: We have not declared any dividends and we do not plan to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities The information set forth below relates to our issuances of securities without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 during the reporting period which were not previously included in an Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K.

The Company received $3,267 as a result of this exercise. On June 12, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with SylvaCap Media for investor relations services. Under this agreement the Company agreed to issue 25,000 shares of the Company’s common stock as compensation for services for a six-month period plus additional cash compensation. On September 10, 2019, SylvaCap agreed to return the shares. As of the date of this filing the shares have not been returned.

Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans In June of 2017, our Board of Directors adopted the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”).

Under the initial Plan, we were able to issue up to an aggregate total of 300,000 incentive or non-qualified options to purchase our common stock, or stock awards. Repurchases The Company has not made any repurchases of shares or other units of any class of the Company’s equity securities during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report.

Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year ended September 30, 2019, our primary sources of liquidity came from existing cash, related party and third-party term notes, and proceeds from securities purchase agreements on convertible debts. Based on our current plans and business conditions, we believe that existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing, the timing of new product introductions and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services. If cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may open a revolving line of credit with a bank, or we may have to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities. In the event such financing is needed in the future, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us, or, if available, that it will be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. If cash flows from operations became insufficient to continue operations at the current level, and if no additional financing was obtained, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. As of September 30, 2019, we had total current assets of $9,884,045, consisting of cash, accounts receivable, contract assets and prepaid expenses and other current assets, and total assets in the amount of $23,434,252. Our total current liabilities as of September 30, 2019 were $1,502,590. We had a working capital surplus of $8,381,455 as of September 30, 2019. Operating activities used $5,697,989 in cash for the year ended September 30, 2019, as compared with $1,260,521 for the same period ended September 30, 2018. Our net loss of $26,116,932 was the main component of our negative operating cash flow for the year ended September 30, 2019, offset mainly by impairment expense of $6,915,186, depreciation and amortization of $1,902,981, amortization of capitalized software of $1,453,635 and stock-based compensation of $1,993,043.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, ""Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,"" which modifies the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees to largely align it with the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for us for annual periods beginning October 1, 2019. We are evaluating the potential impact to our financial position or results of operations. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,"" which allows for the capitalization of certain implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. ASU 2018-15 allows for either retrospective adoption or prospective adoption to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (“ASC 842”). The guidance requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Existing sale-leaseback guidance, including guidance for real estate, is replaced with a new model applicable to both lessees and lessors. ASC 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations. The Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most “critical accounting polices” in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results, and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in the footnotes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019, however we consider our critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition, long-lived assets, accounts receivable, fair value of financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, warranty liability and stock-based compensation. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2019, there were no off balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Index to Financial Statements Required by Article 8 of Regulation S-X: Audited Consolidated Financial Statements: REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of CleanSpark, Inc. Bountiful, Utah Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CleanSpark, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated December 16, 2019 expressed an adverse opinion. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ MaloneBailey, LLP www.malonebailey.com We have served as the Company's auditor since 2018. Houston, Texas December 16, 2019 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of CleanSpark, Inc. Bountiful, Utah Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of CleanSpark, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of September 30, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the Company after the date of management’s assessment. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 and for the years then ended and our report dated December 16, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (“Management’s Report”). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A material weakness is deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s assessment: (i) Lack of documentation around the components of internal control and inadequate risk assessment over the Company’s internal controls; (ii) Inadequate design of monitoring controls resulting in insufficient levels of review over the financial reporting and business processes; (iii) Inadequate segregation of duties; (iv) Inadequate controls over information technology and (v) Insufficient board oversight and review. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2019 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report on those financial statements. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ MaloneBailey, LLP www.malonebailey.com Houston, Texas December 16, 2019 CLEANSPARK, INC.

ORGANIZATION AND LINE OF BUSINESS Organization CleanSpark, Inc. (“CleanSpark”, “we”, “our”, the ""Company"") was incorporated in the state of Nevada on October 15, 1987 as SmartData Corporation. SmartData conducted a 504-public offering in the State of Nevada in December 1987 and began trading publicly in January 1988. Due to a series of unfortunate events, including the untimely death of the founding CEO, SmartData discontinued active business operations in 1992. On March 25, 2014, we began operations in the alternative energy sector. In December 2014, the Company changed its name to Stratean Inc. through a short-form merger in order to better reflect the new business plan. On July 1, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, as amended (the “Purchase Agreement”), with CleanSpark Holdings LLC, CleanSpark LLC, CleanSpark Technologies LLC and Specialized Energy Solutions, Inc. (together, the “Seller”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired CleanSpark, LLC and all the assets related to the Seller and its line of business and assumed $200,000 in liabilities. In October 2016, the Company changed its name to CleanSpark, Inc. through a short-form merger in order to better reflect the brand identity. On January 22, 2019, CleanSpark entered into an Agreement with Pioneer Critical Power, Inc., whereby it acquired certain intellectual property assets and clients lists. As consideration the Company issued to its sole shareholder (i) 175,000 of the common stock of CleanSpark, (ii) a five-year warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of CleanSpark common stock at an exercise price of $16.00 per share, and (iii) a five-year warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of CleanSpark common stock at an exercise price of $20.00 per share. As a result of the transaction Pioneer Critical Power Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of CleanSpark Inc. On February 1, 2019, Pioneer Critical Power, Inc. was renamed CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc. On December 5, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share. On December 10, 2019, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) approved the Company’s 1:10 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock. The reverse stock split took effect on December 11, 2019. Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts and share information in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, have been adjusted for the stock split as if such stock split occurred on the first day of the first period presented. Line of Business Through the acquisition of CleanSpark, LLC, the Company provides microgrid solutions to military, commercial and residential properties. The solutions offered consist of software products and services, microgrid design and engineering, project consulting services. The work is performed under fixed price bid contracts and negotiated price contracts. The Company performed the majority of its work in California during the year ended September 30, 2019. Through CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc., the Company provides customer hardware solutions for distributed energy systems that serve military and commercial residential properties. The equipment is generally sold under negotiated price contracts. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES This summary of significant accounting policies of CleanSpark Inc. is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity The Company has incurred losses for the past several years while developing infrastructure and its software platforms. As shown in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred net losses of $26,116,932 and $47,006,165 during the years ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively. In response to these conditions and to ensure the Company has sufficient capital for ongoing operations for a minimum of 12 months we have raised additional capital through the sale of debt and equity securities pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. (See Note8 for additional details.) As of September 30, 2019, the Company had working capital of approximately $8,381,455. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CleanSpark, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, CleanSpark, LLC, CleanSpark, II, LLC and CleanSpark Critical Power Systems Inc. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities. Use of estimates – The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company’s goodwill impairment, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, allowances for uncollectible accounts, and the valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition - We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the Financial Accounting Standard Board's (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, which requires that five steps be followed in evaluating revenue recognition: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identity the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfied a performance obligation. We did not have a cumulative impact as of October 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Topic 606 and there was not an impact to our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 as a result of applying Topic 606. Our accounting policy on revenue recognition by type of revenue is provided below. Engineering & Construction Contracts and Service Contracts The Company recognizes engineering and construction contract revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer. Engineering and construction contracts are generally accounted for as a single unit of account (a single performance obligation) and are not segmented between types of services. The Company recognizes revenue based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost (an input method). The input method is the most faithful depiction of the Company’s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer. Customer-furnished materials, labor and equipment and, in certain cases, subcontractor materials, labor and equipment, are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent (i.e., the company integrates the materials, labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer). Customer-furnished materials are only included in revenue and cost when the contract includes construction activity and the Company has visibility into the amount the customer is paying for the materials or there is a reasonable basis for estimating the amount. The Company recognizes revenue, but not profit, on certain uninstalled materials that are not specifically produced, fabricated, or constructed for a project. Revenue on these uninstalled materials is recognized when the cost is incurred (when control is transferred). Changes to total estimated contract cost or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level. Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred unless they are expected to be recovered from the client. Project mobilization costs are generally charged to project costs as incurred when they are an integrated part of the performance obligation being transferred to the client. Customer payments on engineering and construction contracts are typically due within 30 to 45 days of billing, depending on the contract. For service contracts (including maintenance contracts) in which the Company has the right to consideration from the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date, revenue is recognized when services are performed and contractually billable. Service contracts that include multiple performance obligations are segmented between types of services. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. Revenue recognized on service contracts that have not been billed to clients is classified as a current asset under contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized on service contracts to date are classified as a current liability under contract liabilities. Customer payments on service contracts are typically due within 30 days of billing, depending on the contract. Revenues from Sale of Equipment Performance Obligations Satisfied at a point in time. We recognize revenue on agreements for non-customized equipment we sell on a standardized basis to the market at a point in time. We recognize revenue at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is generally upon shipment or when the customer has physical possession of the product depending on contract terms. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (i.e., time between shipment and delivery). In situations where arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the goods and that acceptance is likely to occur. We generally do not provide for anticipated losses on point in time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer. Our billing terms for these point in time equipment contracts vary and generally coincide with shipment to the customer; however, within certain businesses, we receive progress payments from customers for large equipment purchases, which is generally to reserve production slots with our manufacturing partners, which are recorded as contract liabilities. Service Performance obligations satisfied over time. We enter into long-term product service agreements with our customers primarily within our microgrid segment. These agreements require us to provide preventative maintenance, and standby support services that include certain levels of assurance regarding system performance throughout the contract periods, these contracts will generally range from 1 to 10 years. We account for items that are integral to the maintenance of the equipment as part of our service-related performance obligation, unless the customer has a substantive right to make a separate purchasing decision (e.g., equipment upgrade). Contract modifications that extend or revise contract terms are not uncommon and generally result in our recognizing the impact of the revised terms prospectively over the remaining life of the modified contract (i.e., effectively like a new contract). Revenues are recognized for these arrangements on a straight-line basis consistent with the nature, timing and extent of our services, which primarily relate to routine maintenance and as needed product repairs. Our billing terms for these contracts vary, but we generally invoice periodically as services are provided. Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed and include unbilled receivables (typically for cost reimbursable contracts) of $0 and contract work in progress (typically for fixed-price contracts) of $57,077 as of September 30, 2019. Unbilled receivables, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time, are reclassified to accounts receivable when they are billed under the terms of the contract. Advances that are payments on account of contract assets of $0 and $0 as of September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively, have been deducted from contract assets. Contract liabilities represent amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized to date. The Company recorded $499,401 and $0 in contract liabilities as of September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively. Variable Consideration The nature of the Company’s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims and unpriced change orders; awards and incentive fees; and liquidated damages and penalties. The Company recognizes revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value (i.e., the sum of a probability-weighted amount) or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount. Factors considered in determining whether revenue associated with claims (including change orders in dispute and unapproved change orders in regard to both scope and price) should be recognized include the following: (a) the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim, (b) additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and not the result of deficiencies in the company’s performance, (c) claim-related costs are identifiable and considered reasonable in view of the work performed, and (d) evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable. If the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met, revenue is recorded only when the costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred. Back charges to suppliers or subcontractors are recognized as a reduction of cost when it is determined that recovery of such cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated. Disputed back charges are recognized when the same requirements described above for claims accounting have been satisfied. The C ompany generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its engineering and construction contracts. The warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of the Company’s work on a project. Historically, warranty claims have not resulted in material costs incurred. Practical Expedients If the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Company’s performance completed to date (a service contract in which the company bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), the Company recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice for services performed. The Company does not adjust the contract price for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the company transfers a service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service will be one year or less. The Company has made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are collected by the Company from its customers (use taxes, value added taxes, some excise taxes). For the year ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company reported revenues of $4,532,782 and $578,635, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents – For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments and short-term debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There was $7,838,857 and $412,777 in cash and no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively. Accounts receivable - is comprised of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and management closely monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reviewed periodically for collectability. If management determines that collection is unlikely, an allowance that reflects management’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected is recorded. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $254,570 and $0 at September 30, 2019, and September 30, 2018, respectively. Retention receivable is the amount withheld by a customer until a contract is completed. Retention receivables of $159,989 and $17,751 were included in the balance of trade accounts receivable as of September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively Concentration Risk At times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of FDIC limits. As of September 30, 2019, the cash balance in excess of the FDIC limits was $7,588,857. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in these accounts. The Company had certain customers whose revenue individually represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue. (See Note 14 for details.) Warranty Liability – The Company establishes warranty liability reserves to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of installation and product defects, product recalls and litigation incidental to the Company’s business. Liability estimates are determined based on management’s judgment, considering such factors as historical experience, the likely current cost of corrective action, manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action, consultations with third party experts such as engineers, and discussions with the Company’s general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases. The Company’s manufacturers and service providers currently provide substantial warranties between ten to twenty-five years with full reimbursement to replace and install replacement parts. Warranty costs and associated liabilities for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $0 and $0, respectively. Stock-based compensation – The Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10 “ Compensation-Stock Compensation, ” which requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50 under which the awards are valued at the earlier of a commitment date or upon completion of the services, based on the fair value of the equity instruments, and are recognized as expense over the service period. The Company may issue compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management, accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services. Earnings (loss) per share – The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 260-10 “ Earnings Per Share, ” which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2019, there are 5,508,400 shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and convertible debt which have been excluded as anti-dilutive. Long-lived Assets – In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounts Standard Codification (ASC) ASC 360-10, ""Property, Plant and Equipment,"" the carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. During the years ended September 30, 2019 the Company recorded an impairment expense of $6,915,186 related to impairment of software and during the year ended September 30, 2019 the Company recorded an impairment expense of $1,896,090 related to a patent and client lists acquired in 2016 which the Company does not anticipate utilizing in future periods, respectively. Intangible Assets and Goodwill – The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The Company reviews its indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In accordance with its policies, the Company performed an assessment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill and determined there was no impairment for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Software Development Costs – The Company capitalizes software development costs under guidance of ASC 985-20 “Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed”. Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and infrastructure design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established, and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, such as mPulse and mVSO this may occur early in the development cycle. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of ""Product development."" Capitalized costs for products that are cancelled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to ""Product development"" in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development, such as product enhancements to existing features, which are not capitalized are charged immediately to ""Product development."" Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to ""Cost of revenues—software amortization "" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of seven years for our current product offerings. In accordance with ASC 985-35 in recognition of the uncertainties involved in estimating future revenue, amortization will never be less than straight-line amortization of the products remaining estimated economic life. We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior periods, the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the software platform to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable software; orders for the product prior to its release; pending contracts and general market conditions. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations. If an impairment occurs the reduced amount of the capitalized software costs that have been written down to the net realizable value at the close of each annual fiscal period will be considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. Fair Value of financial instruments –The carrying value of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and debt (See Notes 7 & 8) approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s long-term convertible debt is also stated at fair value since the stated rate of interest approximates market rates. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable. Income taxes – The Company’s calculation of its tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. The Company recognizes tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on management’s estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes will be required. The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2019 and 2018. Deferred income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Temporary differences arise from net operating losses, differences in depreciation methods of archived images, and property and equipment, stock-based and other compensation, and other accrued expenses. A valuation allowance is established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S., or the various state jurisdictions, may be materially different from management’s estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. Interest and penalties are included in tax expense. The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operation in the provision for income taxes. As of September 30, 2019, and 2018, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Reclassifications – Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations or net assets of the Company. Segment Reporting – Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding the method to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company currently has one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes, which represents the Company's core business. Recently issued accounting pronouncements In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, ""Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting,"" which modifies the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to nonemployees to largely align it with the accounting for share-based payment awards issued to employees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for us for annual periods beginning October 1, 2019. We are evaluating the potential impact to our financial position or results of operations. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,"" which allows for the capitalization of certain implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. ASU 2018-15 allows for either retrospective adoption or prospective adoption to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (“ASC 842”). The guidance requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Existing sale-leaseback guidance, including guidance for real estate, is replaced with a new model applicable to both lessees and lessors. ASC 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations. The Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 3. ACQUISITION OF PIONEER CRITICAL POWER, INC. AND RELATED ASSETS On January 22, 2019, CleanSpark entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Pioneer Critical Power, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Pioneer”), and CleanSpark Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of CleanSpark (“Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with Pioneer surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CleanSpark. At the effective time of the Merger, the issued and outstanding common shares of Pioneer were automatically converted into the right to receive: (i) 175,000 of the common stock of CleanSpark, (ii) a five-year warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of CleanSpark common stock at an exercise price of $16.00 per share, and (iii) a five-year warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of CleanSpark common stock at an exercise price of $20.00 per share. The Merger closed on January 22, 2019 with the filing of a Certificate of Merger in Delaware. The Company accounted for the acquisition of Pioneer as an asset acquisition under ASC 805, because the assets acquired did not meet the definition of a business under ASC 805-10-55-4 as it lacked a substantive process at the time of the acquisition. The Company determined the fair value of the consideration in accordance with ASC 820 as follows: The Company allocated the purchase price to the identifiable assets as follows: On February 1, 2019, Pioneer Critical Power, Inc. was renamed CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc. Support Agreements As a condition to the Merger Agreement, on January 22, 2019, CleanSpark and Pioneer Power Solutions, Inc. (“Pioneer Power”), a Delaware corporation and sole shareholder of Pioneer prior to the Merger, entered into a Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement whereby Pioneer Power agreed, among other things, to not compete with the Company or solicit employees or customers of the Company for a period of four years. As another condition to the Merger Agreement, on January 22, 2019, CleanSpark, the Company and Pioneer Power entered into an Indemnity Agreement, whereby Pioneer Power agreed to indemnify CleanSpark for any claims made by Myers Power Products, Inc. in the case titled Myers Power Products, Inc. v. Pioneer Power Solutions, Inc., Pioneer Custom Electrical Products, Corp., et al ., Los Angeles County Superior Court Case No. BC606546 (“Myers Power Case”) as they may relate to Pioneer or CleanSpark post-closing of the Merger Agreement. Finally, as another condition to the Merger Agreement, on January 22, 2019, CleanSpark and Pioneer Power entered into a Contract Manufacturing Agreement, whereby Pioneer Power shall exclusively manufacture parallel switchgears, automatic transfer switches and related control and circuit protective equipment for CleanSpark for a period of eighteen months.

The Plan allows the Company to grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation right, or restricted stock. The incentive stock options are exercisable for up to ten years, at an option price per share not less than the fair market value on the date the option is granted. The incentive stock options are limited to persons who are regular full-time employees of the Company at the date of the grant of the option. Non-qualified options may be granted to any person, including, but not limited to, employees, independent agents, consultants and attorneys, who the Company’s Board believes have contributed, or will contribute, to the success of the Company. Non-qualified options may be issued at option prices of less than fair market value on the date of grant and may be exercisable for up to ten years from date of grant. The option vesting schedule for options granted is determined by the Board of Directors at the time of the grant. The Plan provides for accelerated vesting of unvested options if there is a change in control, as defined in the Plan. The following is a summary of stock option activity during the years ended September 30, 2019 and year ended September 30, 2018. As of September 30, 2019, there are options exercisable to purchase 55,241 shares of common stock in the Company and 26,000 unvested options outstanding that cannot be exercised until vesting conditions are met.

The Black-Scholes model utilized the following inputs to value the options granted during the year ended September 30, 2018: 13. INCOME TAXES The Company provides for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. FASB ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently. FASB ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the Company’s opinion, it is uncertain whether they will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset. Accordingly, a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been recorded. The total deferred tax asset is approximately $8.9 million as of September 30, 2019 which is calculated by multiplying a 21% estimated tax rate by the cumulative net operating loss (NOL) of approximately $42.3 million. Due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 2017, we have calculated our deferred tax assets using an estimated corporate tax rate of 21%. US Tax codes and laws may be subject to further reform or adjustment which may have a material impact to the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. The significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 are as follows: As of September 30, 2019, and 2018, the Company had gross federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $42.3 million and $27.6 million, respectively. The Company plans to file its U.S. federal return for the year ended September 30, 2019 upon the issuance of this filing. Upon filing of the tax return for the year ended September 30, 2019 the actual deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance available to the Company may differ from management’s estimates. The tax years 2014-2018 remained open to examination for federal income tax purposes by the major tax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. No tax returns are currently under examination by any tax authorities. 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Office leases The Company’s corporate offices are located at 70 North Main Street, Suite 105, Bountiful, Utah 84010. The Company occupies the leased space on a month to month basis at a rate of $850 per month. Future minimum lease payments under the operating leases for the facilities as of September 30, 2019, are $0.

The agreement calls for the Company to make payments of $4,057 in base rent per month through July 31, 2021 subject to an annual 3% rent escalation. Future minimum lease payments under the operating leases for the facilities as of September 30, 2019, are as follows: Legal contingencies From time to time we may be subject to litigation. Risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify, and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. We have acquired liability insurance to reduce such risk exposure to the Company. Despite the measures taken, such policies may not cover future litigation, or the damages claimed may exceed our coverage which could result in continent liabilities. 15.

Controls and Procedures EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), with assistance from other members of management, has reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2019 and, based on his evaluation, has concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not sufficient as of such date due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, described below. MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We identified a material weakness in the design of internal control related to the following areas: (i) Lack of documentation around the components of internal control and inadequate risk assessment process over the Company’s internal controls (ii) Inadequate design of monitoring controls resulting in insufficient levels of review over the financial reporting and business processes (iii) Inadequate segregation of duties (iv) Inadequate controls over information technology (v) Insufficient board oversight and review. These material weaknesses did not result in any identified material misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Based on this material weakness, management concluded that at September 30, 2019, internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Our independent registered public accounting firm, MaloneBailey, LLP has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2019, which appears on page F-2. Following identification of the material weakness and prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed substantive procedures for the year ended September 30, 2019. Based on these procedures, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our CEO and CFO has certified that, based on his knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of CleanSpark as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-K. MaloneBailey, LLP has issued an unqualified opinion on our financial statements, which appears on page F-1. REMEDIATION Management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: (i) additional qualified staff were appointed during the quarter ended September 30, 2019 and subsequent to the year end to increase segregation of duties and create multiple levels of review. (ii) the implementation of additional monitoring controls to improve documentation of internal control procedures; (iii) the implementation of additional review procedures to ensure control activities are appropriately performed and documented; and (iv) enhanced quarterly reporting on the remediation measures to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. (v) appointment of additional board members subsequent to yearend to create a majority independent board (vi) we intend to adopt a different financial reporting software that has increased controls built into the system functionality before the end of second fiscal quarter, in the interim we plan to implement additional controls to mitigate existing controls risks inherent to our existing accounting software (vii) additional controls to improve risk assessment procedures to ensure all risks have been addressed. We believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness, once management has performed its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting including the remedial measures described above. The weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2020. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Except for the material weakness identified during the quarter, as of September 30, 2019, and except for the remedial measures described above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Internal Controls Notwithstanding the foregoing, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. Limitations inherent in any control system include the following: Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

Business Our Business We are in the business of providing advanced energy software and control technology that enables a plug-and-play enterprise solution to modern energy challenges. Our services consist of intelligent energy monitoring and controls, microgrid design and engineering, microgrid consulting services, and turn-key microgrid implementation services. Our software allows energy users to obtain resiliency and economic optimization. Our software is uniquely capable of enabling a microgrid to be scaled to the user's specific needs and can be widely implemented across commercial, industrial, military and municipal deployment. Integral to our business is our mPulse and mVSO software platforms (the “Platforms”). When the Platforms are implemented on a customer’s power system they are able to control the distributed energy resources on site to provide secure, sustainable energy often at significant cost savings for our energy customers. The Platforms allows customers to efficiently manage renewable energy generation, other distributed energy generation technologies including energy generation assets, energy storage assets, and energy consumption assets. By having autonomous control over the distributed facets of energy usage and energy storage, customers are able to reduce their dependency on utilities, thereby keeping energy costs relatively constant over time. The overall aim is to transform energy consumers into energy producers by supplying power that anticipates their routine instead of interrupting it. We also own patented gasification technologies. Our technology converts any organic material into SynGas. SynGas can be used as clean, renewable, environmentally friendly, warming fuel for power plants, motor vehicles, and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether). As previously disclosed, we plan to continue our focus on the CleanSpark side of the business in 2019, as opposed to expending significant efforts on the Gasifier side of the business. We plan to continue our efforts to better our technology, service existing customers and market our System (defined below) to prospective clients. We feel that this focus would provide the best opportunity for our shareholders. Our Distributed Energy Management Business Integral to our business is our Distributed Energy Management Business (the “DER Business”). The main assets of our DER Business include our propriety software systems (“Systems”) and also our engineering and methodology trade secrets. The Distributed Energy systems and Microgrids that utilize our Systems are capable of providing secure, sustainable energy with significant cost savings for its energy customers. The Systems allows customers to design, engineer, construct and then efficiently manage renewable energy generation, storage and consumption. By having autonomous control over the multiple facets of energy usage and storage, customers are able to reduce their dependency on utilities, thereby keeping energy costs relatively constant over time. The overall aim is to transform energy consumers into intelligent energy producers by supplying and managing power in a manner that anticipates their routine instead of interrupting it. Around the world, the aging grid is becoming unstable and unreliable due to increases in loads and lack of new large-scale generation facilities. This inherent instability is compounded by the push to integrate a growing number and variety of renewable but intermittent energy generators and advanced technologies into outdated electrical systems. Simultaneously, defense installations, industrial complexes, communities, and campuses across the world are turning to virtual power plants and microgrids as a means to decrease their reliance from the grid, reduce utility costs, utilize cleaner power, and enhance energy security and surety. The convergence of these factors is creating a “perfect storm” in the power supply optimization and energy management arena. Efficiently building and operating the distributed energy management systems and microgrids of tomorrow, while maximizing the use of sustainable energy to produce affordable, stable, predictable, and reliable power on a large scale, is a significant opportunity that first-movers can leverage to capture a large share of this emerging global industry. A microgrid is comprised if any number of generation, energy storage, and smart distribution assets that serve a single or multiple loads, both connected to the utility grid and separate from the utility grid “islanded.” In the past, distributed energy management systems and microgrids have consisted or off-grid generators organized with controls to provide power where utility lines cannot run. Today, modern distributed energy management systems and microgrids integrate renewable energy generation systems (REGS) with advanced energy storage devices and interoperate with the local utility grid. Advanced autonomous cyber-secure microgrids controls relay information between intelligent hardware and localized servers to make decisions in real-time that deliver optimum power where it is needed, when it is needed. Our Systems create an integrated distributed energy management control platform that seamlessly integrates all forms of energy generation with energy storage devices and controls facility loads to provide energy security in real time free of cyber threats. Able to interoperate with the local utility grid, the Systems bring users the ability to choose when to buy or sell power to and from the grid, enabling what we believe is the most cost effective power solution that exists on the current market. Our Systems are ideal for commercial, industrial, mining, defense, campus and residential users and ranges in size from 4KW to 100MW and beyond and can deliver power at or below the current cost of utility power. Our services consist of turn-key distributed energy and microgrid implementation services, distributed energy microgrid system design and engineering, project development consulting services and solar photovoltaic installation and consulting. The work is performed under fixed price bid contracts, and negotiated price contracts. mPulse Software Suite mPulse is a modular platform that enables fine-grained control of a Microgrid based on customer operational goals, equipment and forecasts of load and generation. mPulse performs high-frequency calculations, threshold-based alarming, execution of domain-specific business rules, internal and external health monitoring, historical data persistence, and system-to-operator notifications. The modular design increases system flexibility and extensibility. In addition, the deployment of the mPulse system follows a security-conscious posture by deploying hardware-based firewalls as well as encryption across communication channels. mPulse allows configuration for site-specific equipment and operation and provides a clean, informative user interface to allow customers to monitor and analyze the data streams that describe how their microgrid is operating. mPulse supports our innovative fractal approach to microgrid design, which enables multiple microgrids on a single site to interact in a number of different ways, including as peers, in a parent-child relationship, and in parallel or completely disconnected. Each grid can have different operational objectives, and those operational objectives can change over time. Any microgrid can be islanded from the rest of the microgrid as well as the larger utility grid. The mPulse software can control the workflow required in both the islanding steps as well as the reconnecting steps of this maneuver and coordinate connected equipment such that connections are only made when it is safe to do so. The mPulse software has proven to be robust and reliable, operating successfully at the Camp Pendleton FractalGrid installation continuously for over 3 years with minimal maintenance and support required. Microgrid Value Stream Optimizer (mVSO) The Microgrid Value Stream Optimizer (mVSO) tool provides a robust distributed energy and microgrid system modeling solution. mVSO takes utility rate data and load data for a customer site and helps automate the sizing and analysis of potential microgrid solutions as well as providing a financial analysis around each grid configuration. mVSO uses historical weather data to generate projected energy generation from PV arrays and models how storage responds to varying operational modes and command logics based upon predicted generation and load curves. mVSO analysis multiple equipment combinations and operation situation to determine the optimal configuration for a site based on the financials, equipment outlay, utility cost savings, etc., to arrive at payback and IRR values. This ultimately provides the user with data to design a distributed energy and/or microgrid system that will meet the customers’ performance benchmarks. Version 2.0 improvements On September 27, 2017, we launched the development of mPulse 2.0 and mVSO 2.0. These improvements are being built into our existing software platforms and add significant improvements, which focus on positioning, integration, focus and quality, as outlined below. Positioning When mPulse originally was developed, a main focus of the platform and the industry was resiliency of microgrid operation, specifically in military contexts. Since that time, the microgrid landscape has continued to evolve, and there is growing opportunity within the commercial and industrial space as the markets in these spaces desire microgrids capable of obtaining the highest economic advantage. Further, this growing focus on economic advantage is in line with the continued market evolution toward an open energy market at regional levels. We want to be well positioned to enter into this market at each step of its availability, from responding to demand response requests all the way through participating in ancillary grid service markets and fully open transactive energy markets as regulation matures. To position ourselves, the mPulse platform operation is being improved to mirror the predicted energy market progression by implementing internal markets at each level of the system. In these internal markets, energy producing assets are modeled as sellers, and energy consuming assets are modeled as buyers, with the market playing matchmaker between the two and virtually “selling” available energy to the highest bidder, thereby satisfying the energy loads at the highest economic advantage for both participants at any given moment. The internal energy market running at our customers’ sites will take daily feeds of production and load forecasts from the platform to set up the daily market parameters, then ingest a stream of current positions of both buyers and sellers as well as their individual pricing information, which is calculated based on the details of the energy rate under which those consumers operate. Consumers bid into the market along the schedule of the specific rate structure under which those loads operate, with bids including the calculated value of energy and power based on that rate and the predicted total use and power profile during the time period of that bid. Based on the predicted generation profile and the other active bids currently being satisfied, the market either fills or cannot fill the newly received bid, and based on the market’s feedback, the consumer’s operation mode and setpoint will change, which will determine the actual control commands sent to related equipment. This market scenario is mirrored at every level, from an individual node potentially consisting of only one producer and one consumer (power source and meter, respectively), to a higher-level node, in which other nodes participate as either net producers or net consumers, to the site level, and even up to regional level, where sites may participate in the market directly. At each level, details of the level below are aggregated and abstracted away, so each level operates in a simple and self-similar way, mirroring the physical construction of the FractalGrid. These markets shine in optimization scenarios, especially around times of just enough supply or even slight scarcity, which are expected to allow us to reap the maximum economic value for our customers even in the case of undersized grids. In addition, this flexibility allows for ease of integration for new market participants at each level as regulation matures to support further Demand Response programs, ancillary service markets, and eventually peer-to-peer transactive energy. Focus For mPulse 2.0, we are focusing on furthering the development of the economic optimization logic in the platform, including an increased push toward deep learning algorithms and more effective forecasting both on solar generation and facility load. Quality We employ a quality-first mindset in all aspects of our software design. From a software architecture point of view, this translates in designing for the maintainability, extensibility, scalability, availability, accessibility, and deployability of the system. These planned improvements paired with our design and engineering methods and experience are intended to help keep us on the leading edge of the microgrid industry. As of the date of this filing, we have offered a beta release of mPulse 2.0 to a limited number of customers and we are testing system performance with these customers as feature sets are released of the next two quarters. We plan to make a full release of mPulse to all customers in the first quarter of 2019. As of the date of this filing, we intend to release VSO 2.0 to customers in the second quarter of 2019. We were granted a new United States Patents on April 10, 2018 protecting our software systems. The patent, ""Establishing Communication and Power Sharing Links Between Components of a Distributed Energy System, US 9,941, 696 B2,"" is a patent that specifically addresses our engineering and data-analytics technologies, processes and procedures. The patent covers our ability to receive data from a plurality of sources within a microgrid, which is then analyzed to forecast power needs across the microgrid, or a combination of multiple 'fractal' microgrids, and then determining whether or when to share power with the requesting module. MicroGrid Development Projects The California Energy Commission awarded a grant to Harper Construction Company, Inc. in July 2013 to support a microgrid technology demonstration project. We were subcontracted to provided design, development, integration, and installation services for the FractalGrid at the School of Infantry in the 52 Area of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. The Project was subsequently transferred to us for consideration and an agreement to indemnify Harper Construction for all future responsibilities of maintenance, operations and warranty. The project included integration of our proprietary software and controls platform with a variety of energy storage technologies. The system utilizes solar energy generated by pre-existing existing fixed-tilt solar photovoltaic panels and fifteen dual axis tracking concentrated photovoltaic units. Our distributed controls combine the generation with energy storage technologies to create four separate microgrids that self-align together to create a larger microgrid that ties directly into the larger utility grid at the 12kV level, allowing the base to consume energy from the most reliable, affordable source at any given time. The system provides a 100% renewable and sustainable solution to energy security. In the event of an outage or other energy surety threat, the software can autonomously separate the microgrids from the utility and the controls operate them independently in “island” mode, without interrupting service to critical circuits. Once energy from the grid is stabilized, our platform reconnects the microgrid to the utility. Each individual fractal microgrid can work independently or in concert as the larger 1.1MW FractalGrid, sharing data and energy throughout the group to improve efficiency, protect critical circuits, manage supply and demand, and allow for maintenance or repairs, as needed. The entire installation provides the Marine Corps and Department of the Navy with reliable energy security with built in cyber defense. In May of 2017 we completed the first and second stages of a contract for $75,000 for engineering and design and $60,000 for optimization and control logic development. In July of 2017, we were awarded the contract to construct the Microgrid we designed. The $900,000 sub-contract awarded by Bethel-Webcor JV is to install a turn-key advanced microgrid system at the U.S. Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. The contract is in direct support of the United States Department of Navy's communication information system (CIS) operations complex that was recently awarded to the Joint-Venture. The Company begin on-site work for this project in February of 2018 and expects to complete its scope of work in early 2019. In May of 2017, we were able to engineer, design and install a fully off-grid, triple-redundant power system at a private, residential estate in Southern California. On October 2, 2018, we executed a Profession Services Agreement with Macerich to perform engineering, design and consultation services and follow-on construction work to install a Microgrid designed by our engineering team which utilized our mVSO software in creating the system design. The system will be controlled by our mPulse controller upon completion. The microgrid is expected to be located at Macerich’s Thousand Oaks facility in California. The Agreement provides that we will be compensated in stages, and each stage requires that Macerich provide written authorization to proceed. The agreement further requires that an additional Design Build Contract be executed for the construction portion of the project. At this time this agreement only specifically authorizes an initial $88,250 for consultation and engineering services, the balance of the $18 million microgrid installation contract falls under later stages. These additional stages require Macerich’s written authorization to proceed with the overall project. This amount may be subject to further adjustment if the customer requires a change in scope prior to providing written authorization to proceed with construction. A change in scope could be triggered by a variety of reasons not limited to permitting restrictions, utility restrictions and other unforeseen circumstances. We expect to receive written permission to proceed on all stages of the contract in the first quarter of 2019. These projects are examples of the far reaching capabilities of our System and the variety of applications that are available as plug and play solutions. We are pursuing additional microgrid projects and anticipate executing on the projects being pursued in 2019 and 2020. There is no assurances, however, that we will obtain contracts to sustain our operations. Acquisitions As an energy technology company, part of our business model is to assess our technologies, product offerings and business direction and determine whether any strategic acquisitions would benefit us. As previously disclosed, on May 2, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Pioneer Custom Electric Products Corp., a Delaware corporation. On December 27, 2018, the parties to the Purchase Agreement entered into a letter amendment (the “Amendment”) to extend the Termination Date from December 31, 2018 until on or before January 16, 2019. Under the Amendment, the parties agreed that, in addition to the other Closing conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the obligation of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, is subject to Bank of Montreal releasing any Liens it holds on the Acquired Assets. The parties further agreed that they are entering into the extension to, amongst other things, allow the parties sufficient time to negotiate amendments to the business terms and structure of the transactions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. We are still in discussions and negotiations with Pioneer, and we plan to disclose the final business arrangement in the coming days. Our Gasifier Business Integral to our existing business is the Gasifier. We own Patent Nos. 9,890,340B2, 9,359,567, 8,518,133 8,105,401 and 8,347,829 protecting our gasification technology and process for using feedstock comprising gaseous fuel. Our technology converts any organic material into SynGas. SynGas can be used as clean, renewable, environmentally friendly, warming fuel for power plants, motor vehicles, and as feedstock for the generation of DME (Di-Methyl Ether). DME is the premier energy carrier and offers a range of important benefits: Our Gasifier converts the following materials into clean, reusable, renewable, and affordable energy: The process involves the grinding, drying, separating, mixing, and then pelletizing of solid waste. These pellets constitute the feedstock for the Gasifier. Gasifying the pellets produces SynGas. SynGas can be converted into multiple forms of energy including motor vehicle and jet fuels. The SynGas produced is so clean that it generally does not require hot-gas cleanup. SynGas is mostly hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide are primary building blocks for fuels and chemicals. SynGas is a clean burning fuel suitable for use in duel-fuel diesel engines, gas turbines, and steam boilers. We believe that our process is capable of turn the world’s waste problem into an abundant, renewable resource of energy. Our production can be adapted to the specific energy requirements of a given area. Communities are expected to benefit from the countless options created including inexpensive green electric power for homes, clean-burning fuel for garbage trucks, street maintenance equipment, or for resale to other municipalities. Because of the modular nature of the components intrinsic to the process, the plant could provide one energy source, then be converted to provide a different energy product. Our facility could produce additional electric power during the peak demand part of the day and produce fuels during the rest of the day. Our market segmentation is vast as we expect to apply our technology to anything that is carbon based. The markets for which we have focused our efforts include: the electric utility market, municipal waste, processing plants, the refining sector, stranded natural gas fields, and Canadian oil sands. We have begun pursuing opportunities to utilize the assets and intellectual properties purchased. We aim to further develop these technologies in order to pursue licensing, manufacturing and direct sales agreements for our Gasifier technology. The technologies and prototype will need to undergo additional clinical lab testing to further establish its capability of producing large volumes of clean, renewable energy from any carbon compound (Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Coal, Sewage Sludge) into clean Synthesis Gas. Our Gasifier is still under development and a commercially viable Gasifier is not expected to be sellable until we are able to expend additional resources on its testing and development. In December of 2014, we executed an agreement with a third party to independently test our production model prototype. Combustion was engaged to independently test the Gasifer's performance and certify the results of its performance. Combustion Resources completed the initial stages of testing. Upon completion of the testing an initial white paper was published outlining the results and suggested improvements. We anticipate that the cost to complete these improvements will be between $250,000 and $500,000. Upon completion of the improvement we will conduct an extended test run with an independent third party. We believe the results of these independent tests will provide the results needed to prove its commercial viability, at which time we would begin to actively market our Gasifier units. We have not engaged in any significant negotiations to sell our Gasifier products to any major customers. Once completed, we intend to distribute our products through advertisements and sales calls on potential customers with demonstrations of how the products work. Competition We face significant competition in the alternative energy and microgrid markets. Some of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources. Factors that affect our ability to further test a commercially viable Gasifier and upgrade our System include resource limitations, available information and our standards established for projected return on investment. Integral to our business is its Distributed Energy Management Business (the “DER Business”), the main assets of our DER Business include our propriety software systems (“Systems”) and also our engineering and methodology trade secrets. The Distributed Energy systems and Microgrids that utilize our Systems are capable of providing secure, sustainable energy with significant cost savings for its energy customers. The Systems allows customers to design, engineer, construct and then efficiently manage renewable energy generation, storage and consumption. By having autonomous control over the multiple facets of energy usage and storage, customers are able to reduce their dependency on utilities, thereby keeping energy costs relatively constant over time. The overall aim is to transform energy consumers into intelligent energy producers by supplying and managing power in a manner that anticipates their routine instead of interrupting it. Distributed Energy Management Business Competition Our DER Business and software platforms are set up to compete against larger companies. Our integrated microgrid control platform seamlessly integrates energy generation with energy storage devices and controls facility loads to provide energy security in real time. The systems are able to interoperate with the local utility grid and allows users the ability to obtain the most cost-effective power for a facility. The systems are technology agnostic and can incorporate into multiple vendors and manufacturers products and legacy systems. The systems are ideal for commercial, industrial, mining, defense, campus and community users ranging from 4 kw to 100 MW and beyond and can deliver power at or below the current cost of utility power. All of these attributes contribute to our ability to compete with the larger, more established competitors that have rely on their own manufactured products and hardware solutions. Distributed Energy and Microgrid control technologies are new to the market and can be deployed in various formats. Eight technologies that are predominantly used in commercial applications and/or have been extensively studied are: These current technologies of our competitors have a number of inherent problems: The principal advantages of our System are: Gasifier business competition Our Gasifier system is set up to compete against larger gasification projects. Our modular concept allows for parallel processing so a facility could be easily expanded or reduced without risk or changing the basic structure by simply adding or removing module units; it also allows for multiple end product processing, producing electricity, ethanol, and fuels simultaneously, and for universal parts which reduces maintenance costs. This design factor solves repair and maintenance problems by simply shutting down the unit(s) to be repaired and bringing the reserve unit(s) online. All of these attributes contribute to our ability to compete with the larger, more established competitors that have large systems that require significant downtime for maintenance and repair. Gasification technologies can incorporate any one of a number of Gasifiers. Eight gasification technologies that are predominantly used in commercial applications and/or have been extensively studied are: These current technologies of our competitors have a number of inherent problems: The principal advantages of our Gasifier are: Intellectual Property In relation to our Gasifier business, we own the following patents: Patent No. 9,359,567 ‘Gasification Method Using Feedstock Comprising Gaseous Fuels’; Patent No. 8,518,133 ‘Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method’; and Patent No. 8,105,401 ‘Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method.’ ; Patent No. 8,347,829 Electrolytic Reactor and Related Methods for Supplementing the Air Intake of an Internal Combustion Engine In relation to our microgrid business, we own the following patents: Patent No. 9,941,696 B2 ""Establishing Communication and Power Sharing Links Between Components of a Distributed Energy System, awarded April 10, 2018, is a revolutionary patent that specifically addresses CleanSpark's engineering and data-analytics technologies, processes and procedures. The patent covers CleanSpark's ability to 'receive data from a plurality of sources within a microgrid, which is then analyzed to forecast power needs across the microgrid, or a combination of multiple 'fractal' microgrids, and then determining whether or when to share power with the requesting module. The second Patent, ""Parallel Path Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method, US 9,890, 340 B2"", awarded February 13, 2018, further enhances CleanSpark's patent portfolio surrounding its proprietary gasification and waste-to-energy technologies. Government Regulation We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. It is anticipated that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with existing federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and human health will not have a material effect upon us, our capital expenditures, or earnings. We cannot predict what effect additional regulation or legislation, enforcement policies thereunder and claims for damages for injuries to property, employees, other persons and the environment resulting from our operations. Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by state and federal authorities including the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). This regulation has not increased the cost of planning, designing and operating to date. Although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of these operations, there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities, including criminal penalties, will not be incurred. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, including stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages for injuries to property or persons resulting from our activities could result in substantial costs and liabilities. In the conduct of our activities our operations will be subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and similar state statutes require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in its operations. Certain of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in OSHA workplace standards. Other than the above regulations and maintaining our good standing in the State of Nevada, complying with applicable local business licensing requirements, complying with all state and federal tax requirements, preparing our periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and complying with other applicable securities laws, rules, and regulations, we do not believe that existing or probably governmental regulations will have a material effect on our operations. We do not currently require the approval of any governmental agency or affiliated program for our operations. Employees, Consultants and Contractors We currently have 7 employees, and also contract the services of consultants in the various areas of expertise as required. The way in which our business currently operates is as follows: Our Chief Executive Officer, S. Matthew Schultz, currently manages our day-to-day operations. He is responsible for the negotiation of contracts, oversees the design, marketing and implementation of the products and processes, and manages licenses, patents, and other intangible assets. In addition to daily management tasks, Mr. Schultz also researches financing and potential investors. Our CFO, Zachary K. Bradford, is responsible for implementing our strategic goals and objectives. He is also in charge of managing our financial risks, financial planning, accounting records, SEC filings, reviewing financial data, reporting financial performance, preparing budgets, and monitoring expenditures and costs. Our COO, Bryan Huber, is responsible for implementing and overseeing our general operations and research and development activities. In addition, he is responsible for determining the feasibility and marketability of our technology and future technologies that we may acquire. The amount of time devoted to us currently by officers may be limited by the resources we have available. However, we feel the time devoted to operations is enough to cover our current operational requirements. Item 1A. Risk Factors We are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this report. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize, that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Risks Related to Our Business We lack an established operating history and have incurred losses in prior periods, expect to incur losses in the future and we can give no assurance that our operations will result in profits. We have a limited operating history that makes it difficult to evaluate our business. Historical sales pertaining to our System have been in low volume, and we cannot say with certainty when we will begin to achieve profitability. We have not sold any of our Gasifiers. Since inception, we have sustained $66,939,531 in cumulative net losses and we had a net loss for the year ended September 30, 2018 of $47,006,165. We expect to have operating losses at least until such time as we have developed a substantial and stable revenue base. We cannot assure you that we can develop a substantial and stable revenue base or achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Although we have obtained sufficient funding for the year ending September 30, 2019, if we do not obtain increased revenues in 2019, we may have to scale back or cease our activities or seek additional financing, which may significantly harm our chances of success. Because we have generated only a small amount of revenue in prior years and currently operate at a significant loss, we are dependent on generating additional revenue in the coming year or we may need to seek the continued availability of financing in order to continue our business. There can be no assurance that our revenues will develop as planned or that financing sufficient to enable us to continue our operations will be available to us in the future. Moreover, even if we are able to obtain financing in the future, it could be on terms that causes our company’s stock price to suffer or further dilutes shareholder interests in our company. Most of our financing in 2018 was from the issuance of convertible notes along with some funding from the sale of our common stock and related party advances. We obtained approximately $5,000,000 in connection with the sale of a secured convertible promissory note. While this financing is expected to carry us through 2019, our failure to obtain future financing, financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or to produce levels of revenue to meet our financial needs could result in our inability to continue as a going concern and, as a result, our investors could lose their entire investment. In order to maximize our potential for success, we need to generate cashflows from revenues totaling $2,000,000 to $4,000,000 to support our current operations or we may need a similar amount in additional financing in 2020. As explained in this annual report, these cashflows are needed for continued upgrades to our software, testing and refinement of our Gasifier, marketing and sales of both sides of our business operations and for working capital. Our future success is difficult to predict because we operate in emerging and evolving markets, and the industries in which we compete are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles. The renewable energy, microgrid and related industries are emerging and evolving markets which may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and which may lead to period to period variability in our operating results. Our products and services are based on unique technology which we believe offers significant advantages to our customers, but the markets we serve are in a relatively early stage of development and it is uncertain how rapidly they will develop. It is also uncertain whether our products will achieve high levels of demand and acceptance as these markets grow. If companies in the industries we serve do not perceive or value the benefits of our technologies and products, or if they are unwilling to adopt our products as alternatives to traditional power solutions, the market for our products and services may not develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, which could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. As a supplier to the renewable energy, microgrid and related industries, we may be subject to business cycles. The timing, length, and volatility of these business cycles may be difficult to predict. These industries may be cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers’ products, inventory levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital. These changes may affect the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology, and affect our orders, net sales, operating expenses, and net income. In addition, we may not be able to respond adequately or quickly to the declines in demand by reducing our costs. To meet rapidly changing demand in each of the industries we serve, we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity. During periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, effectively manage our supply chain, and motivate and retain key employees. During periods of increasing demand, we must have sufficient inventory to fulfill customer orders, effectively manage our supply chain, and attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned within a business cycle, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The industries in which we compete are highly competitive and we may be unable to successfully compete to survive. We compete in the market for renewable energy products and microgrid technology and associated services that is intensely competitive. Evolving industry standards, rapid price changes and product obsolescence also impact the market. Our competitors include many domestic and foreign companies, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. Our current competitors or new market entrants could introduce new or enhanced technologies, products or services with features that render our technologies, products or services obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. Our success will be dependent upon our ability to develop products that are superior to existing products and products introduced in the future, and which are cost effective. In addition, we may be required to continually enhance any products that are developed as well as introduce new products that keep pace with technological change and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of the marketplace. Even if our current technologies prove to be commercially feasible, there is extensive research and development being conducted on alternative energy sources that may render our technologies and protocols obsolete or otherwise non-competitive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep pace with the technological demands of the marketplace or successfully develop products that will succeed in the marketplace. As a small company, we will be at a competitive disadvantage to most of our competitors, which include larger, established companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other resources than us. There can be no assurance that we will have the capital resources available to undertake the research that may be necessary to upgrade our equipment or develop new devices to meet the efficiencies of changing technologies. Our inability to adapt to technological change could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. To date we have had only sixteen customers for our Microgrid services and System and none for our Gasifiers so we cannot assure you that our customer base will increase. We had revenue from fourteen customers in our fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. We cannot assure you that our customer base will expand or that any decline in net revenue attributable to customer losses will be replaced in a timely manner. If we fail to commercialize our products and services and increase our customer base, our business will fail. Product development is an inherently uncertain process, and we may encounter unanticipated development challenges and may not be able to meet our product development and commercialization milestones. Product development and testing may be subject to unanticipated and significant delays, expenses and technical or other problems. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve our milestones within our planned timeframe or ever. We develop prototypes of planned products prior to the full commercialization of these products. We cannot predict whether prototypes of future products will achieve results consistent with our expectations. A prototype could cost significantly more than expected or the prototype design and construction process could uncover problems that are not consistent with our expectations. Prototypes of emerging products are a material part of our business plan, and if they are not proven to be successful, our business and prospects could be harmed. More generally, the commercialization of our products may also be adversely affected by many factors not within our control, including: Accordingly, we cannot predict that our products will be accepted on a scale sufficient to support development of mass markets for them. We rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our technology, and enforcing those rights could disrupt our business operation and divert precious resources that could ultimately harm our future prospects. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and procedures and patents to protect our proprietary technologies. We own patent numbers 8,518,133 and 8,105,401 ‘Parallel Path, Downdraft Gasifier Apparatus and Method'’ and patent number 9,359,567 ‘Gasification Method Using Feedstock Comprising Gaseous Fuel’– which covers our Gasifier technology. We also own patent number 8,342,829 entitled ‘Electrolytic Reactor and Related Methods for Supplementing the Air Intake of an Internal Combustion Engine.’ The claims contained in any patent may not provide adequate protection for our products and technology. In the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know-how. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to this technology to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If a dispute arises concerning our technology, we could become involved in litigation that might involve substantial cost. Litigation could divert substantial management attention away from our operations and into efforts to enforce our patents, protect our trade secrets or know-how or determine the scope of the proprietary rights of others. If a proceeding resulted in adverse findings, we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties. We might also be required to seek licenses from third parties to manufacture or sell our products. Our ability to manufacture and sell our products may also be adversely affected by other unforeseen factors relating to the proceeding or its outcome. As we continue to grow and to develop our intellectual property, we could attract threats from patent monetization firms or competitors alleging infringement of intellectual property rights. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. If we do not prevail in this type of litigation, we may be required to: pay monetary damages; stop commercial activities relating to our product; obtain one or more licenses in order to secure the rights to continue manufacturing or marketing certain products; or attempt to compete in the market with substantially similar products. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue some of our operations. A material part of our success will depend on our ability to manage our suppliers and contract manufacturers. Our failure to manage our suppliers and contract manufacturers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers. We rely upon suppliers to provide the components necessary to build our products and on contract manufacturers to procure components and assemble our products. There can be no assurance that key suppliers and contract manufacturers will provide components or products in a timely and cost efficient manner or otherwise meet our needs and expectations. Our ability to manage such relationships and timely replace suppliers and contract manufacturers, if necessary, is critical to our success. Our failure to timely replace our contract manufacturers and suppliers, should that become necessary, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and relations with our customers. If we are the subject of future product defect or liability suits, our business will likely fail. In the course of our planned operations, we may become subject to legal actions based on a claim that our products are defective in workmanship or have caused personal or other injuries. We currently maintain liability insurance but there can be no guarantee that such coverage may not be adequate to cover all potential claims. Moreover, even if we are able to maintain sufficient insurance coverage in the future, any successful claim could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be exposed to lawsuits and other claims if our products malfunction, which could increase our expenses, harm our reputation and prevent us from growing our business. Any liability for damages resulting from malfunctions of our products could be substantial, increase our expenses and prevent us from growing or continuing our business. Potential customers may rely on our products for critical needs and a malfunction of our products could result in warranty claims or other product liability. In addition, a well-publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect the market’s perception of our products. This could result in a decline in demand for our products, which would reduce revenue and harm our business. Further, since our products are used in systems that are made up on components made by other manufacturers, we may be subject to product liability claims even if our products do not malfunction. Any failure by management to properly manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. If our business develops as expected, we anticipate that we will grow rapidly in the near future. Our failure to properly manage our expected rapid growth could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain key personnel. Our expansion could also place significant demands on our management, operations, systems, accounting, internal controls and financial resources. If we experience difficulties in any of these areas, we may not be able to expand our business successfully or effectively manage our growth. Any failure by management to manage growth and to respond to changes in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The lack of management experience in the renewable energy and microgrid industries could adversely affect our company. Some members of management and the board of directors may not have prior experience in the energy industry. Some members do, however, have extensive work experience in the reclamation, environmental industries, energy industries, financial/accounting industries, and business management. The lack of experience in the alternative energy industry may impair our managements’ and directors’ ability to evaluate and make decisions involving our current operations and any future projects we may undertake in the alternative energy industry. Such impairment and lack of experience could adversely affect our business, financial condition and future operations. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled experts and workers our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected and our costs may increase. Our rate of growth will be confined by resource limitations as competitors and customers compete for increasingly scarce resources. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of affordable trained experts that can execute our operational strategy. The demand for trained software engineers, electrical engineers and other skilled workers is currently high. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected and the costs of performing our existing and future projects may increase, which may adversely impact our margins. We have engaged in and may engage in acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and reduce our financial resources. We have been involved in significant acquisitions in our lifespan. In the future, we may enter into transactions to acquire other businesses, products or technologies. If we do identify suitable candidates, we may not be able to make such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Any acquisitions we have made or plan to make may not strengthen our competitive position, and these transactions may be viewed negatively by customers or investors. We have and may decide in the future to incur debt in connection with an acquisition or issue our common stock or other securities to the stockholders of the acquired company, which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. We could incur losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of the acquired business that are not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the seller. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel, technologies and operations into our existing business in an effective, timely and non-disruptive manner. Acquisitions may also divert management from day-to-day responsibilities, increase our expenses and reduce our cash available for operations and other uses. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future acquisitions or the effect that the acquisition we have engaged in or any such future transactions might have on our operating results. Our business is substantially dependent on utility rate structures and government incentive programs that encourage the use of alternative energy sources. The reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for energy-related technologies would harm our business. We believe that near-term growth of energy-related technologies, including power conversion technology, relies partly on the availability and size of government and economic incentives and grants (including, but not limited to, the U.S. Investment Tax Credit and various state and local incentive programs). These incentive programs could be challenged by utility companies, or for other reasons found to be unconstitutional, and/or could be reduced or discontinued for other reasons. The reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives could harm our business. A combination of utility rate structures and government subsidies that encourage the use of alternative energy sources is a primary driver of demand for our products. For example, public utilities are often allowed to collect demand charges on commercial and industrial customers in addition to traditional usage charges. In addition, the federal government and many states encourage the use of alternative energy sources through a combination of direct subsidies and tariff incentives such as net metering for users that use alternative energy sources such as solar power. California also encourages alternative energy technology through its Self-Generation Incentive Program, or SGIP, which offers rebates for businesses and consumers who adopt certain new technologies. Other states have similar incentives and mandates which encourage the adoption of alternative energy sources. Notwithstanding the adoption of other incentive programs, we expect that California will be the most significant market for the sale of our products in the near term. Should California or another state in which we derive a substantial portion of our product revenues in the future change its utility rate structure or eliminate or significantly reduce its incentive programs, demand for our products could be substantially affected, which would adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and operating results. Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. We may seek additional opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: Acquisitions may also cause us to: Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisition will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate an acquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre–acquisition due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products or the acquired business. Risks Related to Our Securities If a market for our common stock does not develop, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares. Our common stock is quoted under the symbol “CLSK” on the OTCQB operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc., an electronic inter-dealer quotation medium for equity securities. We do not currently have an active trading market. There can be no assurance that an active and liquid trading market will develop or, if developed, that it will be sustained. Our securities are thinly traded. Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of our common stock without significantly depressing the value of the stock. Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could continue to result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock. Our common stock price may be volatile and could fluctuate widely in price, which could result in substantial losses for investors. The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: Because we have limited revenues to date, you should consider any one of these factors to be material. Our stock price may fluctuate widely as a result of any of the above. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have the right to issue shares of preferred stock. If we were to issue preferred stock, it is likely to have rights, preferences and privileges that may adversely affect the common stock. We are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time-to-time by our board of directors. Our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix for any series the dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights, and other rights, preferences and privileges for the preferred stock. We currently have 1,000,000 shares of our preferred stock outstanding, the features of which are contained elsewhere in this annual report. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the preferred stock, could reduce the voting rights and powers of the common stock and the portion of our assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution in the book value per share of the common stock we are offering. The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, to the detriment of the investors in the common stock offered hereby. We cannot assure you that we will not, under certain circumstances, issue shares of our preferred stock. We have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay dividends. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to market our products and to cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, you should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock. If securities or industry analysts do not publish or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us now or in the future issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Because we are subject to the “Penny Stock” rules, the level of trading activity in our stock may be reduced. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define ""penny stock"" to be any listed, trading equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules which may increase the difficulty Purchasers may experience in attempting to liquidate such securities. Provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions. Members of our board of directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Nevada Revised Statutes and our Bylaws as authorized by the Nevada Revised Statutes. Specifically, Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that a director or officer is not individually liable to the company or its shareholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer unless it is proven that (1) the director’s or officer’s act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer and (2) his or her breach of those duties involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. This provision is intended to afford directors and officers protection against and to limit their potential liability for monetary damages resulting from suits alleging a breach of the duty of care by a director or officer. Accordingly, you may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their fiduciary duty of care. In addition, our Bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if you were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses they incurred in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Item 2. Properties Currently, we do not own any real estate. Our corporate offices are located at 70 North Main Street, Suite 105, Bountiful Utah 84010. We executed a one-year lease agreement that calls for us to make payments of $850 per month.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information Our common stock is quoted under the symbol “CLSK” on the OTCQB operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. There is currently no active trading market for our securities. There is no assurance that a regular trading market will develop, or if developed, that it will be sustained. Therefore, a shareholder may be unable to resell his securities in our company. The following table sets forth the range of high and low bid quotations for our common stock for each of the periods indicated as reported by the OTCQB. These quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions. Penny Stock The Securities Exchange Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;(b) contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of Securities' laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price;(d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;(e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and;(f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type, size and format, as the Commission shall require by rule or regulation. The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with; (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;(b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;(c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock if it becomes subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, because our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, stockholders may have difficulty selling those securities. Holders of Our Common Stock As of January 9, 2019, we had 282 holders of record of our common stock, with others in street name. The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of the common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. Dividends There are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends. The Nevada Revised Statutes, however, do prohibit us from declaring dividends where after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend: We have not declared any dividends and we do not plan to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations, assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain and fulfill a contract, and significant judgments in measurement and recognition. In July 2015, the FASB made a decision to defer the effective date of the new standard for one year and permit early adoption as of the original effective date. The new standard will be effective for the Company as of October 1, 2018. The Company has evaluated the impact of the adoption of this standard on its revenue recognition policy and does not believe it will have a material impact on its financial statements. The Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements, and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most “critical accounting polices” in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results, and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in the footnotes to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018, however we consider our critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition, long-lived assets, accounts receivable, fair value of financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, warranty liability and stock-based compensation. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2018, there were no off balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A.

Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cleanspark, Inc. as of September 30, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has limited revenues, has negative working capital at September 30, 2017, has incurred recurring losses and recurring negative cash flow from operating activities, and has an accumulated deficit which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. /s/ AMC Auditing AMC Auditing Las Vegas, Nevada January 15, 2018 CLEANSPARK, INC.

ORGANIZATION AND LINE OF BUSINESS Organization CleanSpark, Inc. (“we”, “our”, the ""Company"") was incorporated in the state of Nevada on October 15, 1987 as SmartData Corporation. SmartData conducted a 504-public offering in the State of Nevada in December 1987 and began trading publicly in January 1988. Due to a series of unfortunate events, including the untimely death of the founding CEO, SmartData discontinued active business operations in 1992. On March 25, 2014, we began operations in the alternative energy sector. In December 2014, the Company changed its name to Stratean Inc. through a short-form merger in order to better reflect the new business plan. On July 1, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, as amended (the “Purchase Agreement”), with CleanSpark Holdings LLC, CleanSpark LLC, CleanSpark Technologies LLC and Specialized Energy Solutions, Inc. (together, the “Seller”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired CleanSpark, LLC and all the assets related to the Seller and its line of business and assumed $200,000 in liabilities. In October 2016, the Company changed its name to CleanSpark, Inc. through a short-form merger in order to better reflect the brand identity. Line of Business Through the acquisition of CleanSpark, LLC, the Company provides microgrid solutions to military, commercial and residential properties. The services offered consist of turn-key microgrid implementation services, microgrid design and engineering, project development consulting services and solar photovoltaic installation and consulting. The work is performed under fixed price bid contracts and negotiated price contracts. The Company performed all of its work in California during the year ended September 30, 2018. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICIES This summary of significant accounting policies of CleanSpark Inc. is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Basis of Presentation The Company has incurred losses for the past several years while developing infrastructure and its software platforms. As shown in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred net losses of $47,006,165 and $13,498,526 during the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. Additionally, as of September 30, 2018, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately $801,207. In response to these conditions, subsequent to September 30, 2018 we have raised additional capital through the sale of debt and equity securities pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. (See Note 17 for additional details.) The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm expressed in its report on the Company’s financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2017 a substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on management’s plans and the capital raised subsequent to the year ended September 30, 2018, that substantial doubt has been alleviated. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CleanSpark, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, CleanSpark, LLC, CleanSpark, II, LLC and CleanSpark Acquisition, Inc. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities. Use of estimates – The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates used to review the Company’s goodwill impairment, impairments and estimations of long-lived assets, revenue recognition on percentage of completion type contracts, allowances for uncollectible accounts, derivative instruments valuation, and the valuations of non-cash capital stock issuances. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition –The Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements” and No. 104, “Revenue Recognition”. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed, or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability is reasonably assured. For the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company reported revenues of $578,635 and $447,963, respectively. Revenues and related costs on construction contracts are recognized using the “percentage of completion method” of accounting in accordance with ASC 605-35, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (“ASC 605-35”). Under this method, contract revenues and related expenses are recognized over the performance period of the contract in direct proportion to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. Costs include direct material, direct labor, subcontract labor and any allocable indirect costs. All un-allocable indirect costs and corporate general and administrative costs are charged to the periods as incurred. However, in the event a loss on a contract is foreseen, the Company will recognize the loss as it is determined. Revisions in cost and profit estimates during the course of the contract are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts, which require the revision, become known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions, and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. The Asset, “Costs in excess of billings”, represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on contracts in progress. The Liability, “Billings in excess of costs”, represents billings in excess of revenues recognized on contracts in progress. At September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the costs in excess of billings balance were $52,439 and $0, and the billings in excess of costs balance were $0 and $0, respectively. Accounts receivables are recorded on contracts for amounts currently due based upon progress billings, as well as retention, which are collectible upon completion of the contracts. Accounts payable to material suppliers and subcontractors are recorded for amounts currently due based upon work completed or materials received, as are retention due subcontractors, which are payable upon completion of the contract. General and administrative expenses are charged to operations as incurred and are not allocated to contract costs. Retention receivable is the amount withheld by a customer until a contract is completed. Retention receivables of $17,751 and $0 were included in the balance of trade accounts receivable as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. Accounts Receivable – Accounts receivable is comprised of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and management closely monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reviewed periodically for collectability. If management determines that collection is unlikely, an allowance that reflects management’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected is recorded. Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0 and $0 at September 30, 2018, and September 30, 2017, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents – For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments and short-term debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There was $412,777 and $57,128 in cash and no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, respectively. Concentration Risk At times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of FDIC limits. As of September 30, 2018, the cash balance in excess of the FDIC limits was $149,429. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in these accounts. The Company had certain customers whose revenue individually represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue. (See Note 17 for details.) Warranty Liability – The Company establishes warranty liability reserves to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of installation and product defects, product recalls and litigation incidental to the Company’s business. Liability estimates are determined based on management’s judgment, considering such factors as historical experience, the likely current cost of corrective action, manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action, consultations with third party experts such as engineers, and discussions with the Company’s general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases. The Company’s manufacturers and service providers currently provide substantial warranties between ten to twenty-five years with full reimbursement to replace and install replacement parts. Warranty costs and associated liabilities for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $0 and $0, respectively. Stock-based compensation – The Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10 “ Compensation-Stock Compensation, ” which requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50 under which the awards are valued at the earlier of a commitment date or upon completion of the services, based on the fair value of the equity instruments, and are recognized as expense over the service period. On June 9, 2017, the Company implemented an employee stock-based compensation plan and since inception of the plan has issued 319,206 options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock under this plan as of September 30, 2018. The options are exercisable between $0.80 to $3.45 per share. The Company may issue compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management, accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services. Earnings (loss) per share – The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 260-10 “ Earnings Per Share, ” which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2018, there are 9,461,102 shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and convertible debt which have been excluded as anti-dilutive. Long-lived Assets – In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounts Standard Codification (ASC) ASC 360-10, ""Property, Plant and Equipment,"" the carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. During the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 the Company recorded an impairment expense of $1,896,090 related to a patent and client lists acquired in 2016 which the Company does not anticipate utilizing in future periods and $8,551,321 related to impairment of software, microgrid and gasification assets, respectively. Intangible Assets and Goodwill – The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” where the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated using the information currently available, and may be adjusted, up to one year from acquisition date, after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed and revisions to preliminary estimates. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the tangible and identified intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The Company reviews its indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In accordance with its policies, the Company performed an assessment of indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill and determined there was no impairment for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. Software Development Costs – The Company capitalizes software development costs under guidance of ASC 985-20 “Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed”. Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs incurred for internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable. Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and infrastructure design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established, and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where proven technology exists, such as mPulse 2.0 and mVSO 2.0 this may occur early in the development cycle. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of ""Product development."" Capitalized costs for products that are cancelled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to ""Product development"" in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately to ""Product development."" Commencing upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to ""Cost of revenues—software amortization "" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of seven years for our current product offerings. In accordance with ASC 985-35 in recognition of the uncertainties involved in estimating future revenue, amortization will never be less than straight-line amortization of the products remaining estimated economic life. We evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior periods, the primary evaluation criterion is the actual performance of the software platform to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology; market performance of comparable software; orders for the product prior to its release; pending contracts and general market conditions. Significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations. If an impairment occurs the reduced amount of the capitalized software costs that have been written down to the net realizable value at the close of each annual fiscal period will be considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. Income taxes – The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with FASB Codification Topic ASC 740-10, “ Income Taxes ”, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Reclassifications – Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. On the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2017 $4,020,269, net of $333,139 in accumulated depreciation has been reclassified from Flexpower system assets to intangible assets. This amount was associated with engineering and trade secrets. Flexpower assets have been reclassified as capitalized software to more clearly reflect the nature of the assets. In addition, $1,067,556 in amortization and depreciation expense related to the capitalized software has been reclassified to product development expense for the year ended September 30, 2017. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations or net assets of the Company. Segment Reporting – Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding the method to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company currently has one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes, which represents the Company's core business. Recently issued accounting pronouncements - In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including revenue recognition policies to identify performance obligations, assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain and fulfill a contract, and significant judgments in measurement and recognition. In July 2015, the FASB made a decision to defer the effective date of the new standard for one year and permit early adoption as of the original effective date. The new standard will be effective for the Company as of October 1, 2018. The Company has evaluated the impact of the adoption of this standard on its revenue recognition policy and does not believe it will have a material impact on its financial statements. The Company has evaluated all other recent accounting pronouncements, and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 3. COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS ON UNCOMPLETED CONTRACTS The Asset, “Costs in excess of billings”, represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on contracts in progress. The Liability, “Billings in excess of costs”, represents billings in excess of revenues recognized on contracts in progress. At September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the costs in excess of billings balance were $52,439 and $0, and the billings in excess of costs balance were $0 and $0, respectively.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES The carrying value of cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and debt (See Notes 8 & 9) approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s long-term debt is also stated at fair value of $150,000 since the stated rate of interest approximates market rates. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets. Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices included for identical or similar assets and liabilities that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. These are typically obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments. The following table presents the derivative financial instruments, the Company’s only financial liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s balance sheets on a recurring basis, and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2018: The embedded conversion feature in the convertible debt instruments that the Company issued (See Note 9), was convertible at issuance which qualified them as a derivative instrument since the number of shares issuable under the note is indeterminate based on guidance in ASC Topic No. 815-15, “Derivatives and Hedging (“Topic No. 815-15”). Topic No. 815-15 requires the Company to bifurcate and separately account for the conversion features as an embedded derivative contained in the Company’s convertible debt. This convertible debt tainted all other equity linked instruments including all outstanding non-employee options and warrants on the date that the instrument became convertible. The Company is required to carry the embedded derivative on its balance sheet at fair value and account for any unrealized change in fair value as a component of results of operations. On September 27, 2018, all derivative instruments held by the Company had been either extinguished through settlement of the associated debts or through amendments to the instruments that removed the derivative aspect of the instrument. The Black-Scholes model utilized the following inputs to value the derivative liabilities at the date of issuance of the convertible note through September 27, 2018 which was the date the derivative liability was terminated: The following table presents a summary of the Company’s derivative liabilities associated with its convertible notes as of September 30, 2018: 10.

INCOME TAXES The Company provides for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. FASB ASC 740 requires the use of an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect currently. FASB ASC 740 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the Company’s opinion, it is uncertain whether they will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the net deferred tax asset. Accordingly, a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset has been recorded. The total deferred tax asset is approximately $5.8 million as of September 30, 2018 which is calculated by multiplying a 21% estimated tax rate by the cumulative net operating loss (NOL) of approximately $27.6 million. Due to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 2017, we have calculated our deferred tax assets using an estimated corporate tax rate of 21%. US Tax codes and laws may be subject to further reform or adjustment which may have a material impact to the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. The significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: As of September 30, 2018, and 2017, the Company had gross federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $27.6 million and $21.0 million, respectively. The Company plans to file its U.S. federal return for the year ended September 30, 2018 upon the issuance of this filing. Upon filing of the tax return for the year ended September 30, 2018 the actual deferred tax asset and associated valuation allowance available to the Company may differ from management’s estimates. The tax years 2014-2017 remained open to examination for federal income tax purposes by the major tax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. No tax returns are currently under examination by any tax authorities. 15.

The Debenture has a maturity date two years from the issuance date and the Company has agreed to pay compounded interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Debenture at the rate equal 7.5% per annum. Interest is payable on the date the applicable principal is converted or on maturity. The interest must be paid in cash and, in certain circumstances, may be paid in shares of common stock. The transactions described above closed on December 31, 2018. In connection with the issuance of the Debenture and pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the Company issued to the Investor 100,000 shares of common stock and a Common Stock Purchase Warrant to acquire up to 3,083,333 shares of common stock for a term of three years (the “Warrant”) on a cash-only basis at an exercise price of $2.00 per share with respect to 1,250,000 Warrant Shares, $2.50 with respect to 1,000,000 Warrant Shares, $5.00 with respect to 500,000 Warrant Shares and $7.50 with respect to 333,333 Warrant Shares.

Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure On July 17, 2018, we dismissed AMC Auditing as our independent registered public accounting firm and appointed MaloneBailey, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. The engagement of MaloneBailey, LLP was approved by our Board of Directors. On July 18, 2018, we filed a Form 8-K announcing the change in auditors and that filing is incorporated by reference herein. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, being September 30, 2018. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company’s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2018, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. We plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending September 30, 2019: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to an exemption for non-accelerated filers set forth in Section 989G of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Remediation of Material Weakness We are unable to remedy our controls related to the inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management until we receive financing to hire additional employees. We are currently in the process of hiring an outsourced service provider to improve the controls for accounting and financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the year ended September 30, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors or all fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements, due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns may occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk. Item 9B. Other Information None. PART III Item 10.

Our officers are appointed by our board of directors and hold office until removed by the board. Family Relationships There are no family relationships between or among the directors, executive officers or persons nominated or chosen by us to become directors or executive officers. Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings To the best of our knowledge, during the past ten years, none of the following occurred with respect to a present or former director, executive officer, or employee: (1) any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (2) any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (3) being subject to any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his or her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; and (4) being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated.

Our company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The board of directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the board of directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The board of directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment. A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our board of directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to the Chairman of our Board of Directors, Larry McNeill, at the address appearing on the first page of this annual report. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company’s directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company’s equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock and other equity securities of the Company. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. To the best of the Company’s knowledge based solely on a review of Forms 3, 4, and 5 (and any amendments thereof) received by us during or with respect to the year ended September 30, 2018, the following persons have not filed on a timely basis, the identified reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during fiscal year ended September 30, 2018: Code of Ethics We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller.

FORM 10-K SUMMARY 110 SIGNATURES 111 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview AbbVie or ""the company"" refer to AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. AbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. Segments AbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. See Note 16, ""Segment and Geographic Area Information"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and the sales information related to AbbVie's key products and geographies included under Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.""

Linzess (linaclotide) is a once-daily guanylate cyclase-C agonist used in adults to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS‑C) and chronic idiopathic constipation. The product is marketed as Linzess in the United States and as Constella outside of the United States. Synthroid. Synthroid (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP) is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism. AbbVie has the rights to sell Creon and Synthroid only in the United States. Marketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities AbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and distribute its products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand of products by physicians, external experts and other health care providers. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example, State Medicaid programs, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie also markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States many of the company's products must be sold pursuant to a prescription. Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its promotional and market access efforts on external experts, payers, physicians and health systems. AbbVie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality, AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. In 2022, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 39% of AbbVie's 2022 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers system to agree on reimbursement terms. 2022 Form 10-K | 4 Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business. Competition The markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products, therapies and biologics. For example, AbbVie's immunology products compete with anti-TNF products, JAK inhibitors and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states, and AbbVie's oncology products compete with BTK inhibitors. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVie’s competitors could cause revenues for AbbVie’s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases. Biosimilars. Competition for AbbVie’s biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as “biosimilars.” Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for small molecule medications, and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products. Humira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe, the United States and other countries, and AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products. In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FFDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the regulations implementing these statutes. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the PHSA, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is complex. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is ""highly similar"" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies. Furthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be ""interchangeable"" will be considered by the FDA as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its full ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty. Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity Generally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVie’s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a “patent term restoration,” for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a 5 | 2022 Form 10-K compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration. Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a conventional drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Specific conditions of use approved for individual products may also be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law. Applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not generally be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods. Biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products. AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications. These patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2023 to the early 2040s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVie’s business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark Humira), are material in relation to the company’s business as a whole. AbbVie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufacturers. Under the agreements, the licenses in the United States begin in 2023 and the licenses in Europe began in 2018. In addition, the following patents, licenses and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark Imbruvica), those related to risankizumab (which is sold under the trademark Skyrizi) and those related to upadacitinib (which is sold under the trademark Rinvoq). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027, with pediatric regulatory exclusivity then extending until May 2028. However, no generic entry for any ibrutinib product is expected prior to March 30, 2032. The United States composition of matter patent covering risankizumab is expected to expire in 2033. And the United States composition of matter patent covering upadacitinib is expected to expire in 2033. AbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, 2022 Form 10-K | 6 contractors and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVie’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVie’s employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements In addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-to-acquire agreements, licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements and joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5, ""Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements—Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Third Party Agreements AbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing-related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie seeks to maintain sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption. AbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5, ""Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements—Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Sources and Availability of Raw Materials AbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. Despite the disruption to the global supply chain caused by COVID-19, AbbVie has continued to supply patients with no material supply impact, except for the previously-disclosed supply issues impacting Lupron. Given the general increased global volatility due to the pandemic, AbbVie is monitoring and taking actions to mitigate potential supply shortages which may impact the fulfillment of product demand. Research and Development Activities AbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds (and complementary devices) in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVie’s existing portfolio. AbbVie also supplements its research and development efforts with acquisitions. The research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases: • Phase 1— involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and doses for later phases. • Phase 2— tests different doses of the drug in a disease state in order to assess efficacy. • Phase 3— tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety in order to meet requirements to enable global approval. 7 | 2022 Form 10-K Preclinical data and clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar government agencies outside the United States. The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication. In addition to the development of new products, delivery devices and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug. Regulation—Discovery and Clinical Development United States. Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, announced or unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections associated with clinical development may include the sponsor, investigator sites, laboratories, hospitals and manufacturing facilities of AbbVie's subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, including rejection of an NDA or BLA. Even if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be submitted and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Further, the FDA continues to regulate product labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses along with other labeling restrictions. Outside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from applicable supervising regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target markets. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency. After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. In Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Japan-specific trials and/or bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application. 2022 Form 10-K | 8 Similarly, applications for a new product in China are submitted to the Center for Drug Evaluation of the National Medical Products Administration for technical review and approval of a product for marketing in China. Clinical data in Chinese subjects are usually required to support approval in China, requiring the inclusion of China in global pivotal studies, or a separate China/Asian clinical trial. The regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process. Similar to the requirements in Japan and China, certain countries (notably South Korea, Taiwan, India and Russia) also generally require that clinical studies that include data from patients in those countries be conducted in order to support local regulatory approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans). Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing The manufacturing, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. In addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie's business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These studies can lead to updates to the data regarding utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight, investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. AbbVie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Political and budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie's products for the foreseeable future. United States. Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates may affect AbbVie's business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care 9 | 2022 Form 10-K Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities. In the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part D. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 70% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or ""donut hole."" The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. European Union. The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products. Most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems. Japan. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available. Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Since AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action. 2022 Form 10-K | 10 Regulation – Medical Devices Medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA, state agencies and foreign government health authorities. FDA regulations, as well as various U.S. federal and state laws, govern the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping and marketing of medical device products agencies in the United States. AbbVie’s medical device product candidates, including AbbVie’s breast implants, must undergo rigorous clinical testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the United States and other countries. The lengthy process of clinical development and submissions for clearance or approval, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory clearance or approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope, and may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Cleared or approved products and their manufacturers are subject to ongoing review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale and/or use or require their withdrawal from the market. United States . AbbVie’s medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device AbbVie markets in the United States must have a 510(k) clearance or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) in accordance with the FFDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either Class I or Class II, and devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or a device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. In general, a Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA, and any changes to the device subsequent to initial FDA approval must also be reviewed and approved by the FDA. The majority of AbbVie’s medical device products, including AbbVie’s breast implants, are regulated as Class III medical devices. A Class III device may have significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval, and the time in which it takes to obtain approval can be long. Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, unannounced facility inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of AbbVie’s subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of AbbVie’ products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing AbbVie’ request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted; and criminal prosecution. A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (IDE), which must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A study sponsor must obtain approval for its IDE from the FDA, and it must also obtain approval of its study from the Institutional Review Board overseeing the trial. The results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain approval of the investigational device. Once a device is approved, the manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including Quality System Regulation requirements, which involve design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process. Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements. Manufacturers must also report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or if the manufacturer conducts a field correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a health risk. Further, the FDA continues to regulate device labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses along with other labeling restrictions. European Union. Medical device products that are marketed in the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (the MDR), which came into effect in May 2021. The MDR provides for regulatory oversight with respect to the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the European Union are safe and effective for their intended uses. Medical devices that comply with the MDR are entitled to bear a Conformité Européenne marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the European Union. Failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect AbbVie’s ability to market and sell AbbVie’s products in these countries. 11 | 2022 Form 10-K Environmental Matters AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. AbbVie's capital expenditures for pollution control in 2022 were approximately $12 million and operating expenditures were approximately $35 million. In 2023, capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately $9 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately $37 million. Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Some of these locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, and AbbVie has become a party to these investigations and remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which have been transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, AbbVie believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Employees AbbVie employed approximately 50,000 employees in over 70 countries as of January 31, 2023. Outside the United States, some of AbbVie's employees are represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees. Human Capital Management Attracting, retaining and providing meaningful growth and development opportunities to AbbVie's employees is critical to the company's success in making a remarkable impact on people’s lives around the world. AbbVie leverages numerous resources to identify and enhance strategic and leadership capability, foster employee engagement and create a culture where diverse talent is productive and engaged. AbbVie invests in its employees through competitive compensation, benefits and employee support programs and offers best-in-class development and leadership opportunities. AbbVie has developed a deep talent base through ongoing investment in functional and leadership training and by sourcing world-class external talent, ensuring a sustainable talent pipeline. AbbVie continuously cultivates and enhances its working culture and embraces equality, diversity and inclusion as fundamental to the company's mission. Attracting and Developing Talent. Attracting and developing high-performing talent is essential to AbbVie’s continued success. AbbVie implements detailed talent attraction strategies, with an emphasis on STEM skill sets, a diverse talent base and other critical skillsets, including drug discovery, clinical development, market access and business development. AbbVie has also invested in integrated inclusive practices across the end-to-end hiring process and introduced Inclusive Recruitment Live Trainings, as a requirement for all people leaders and recruiters. AbbVie also invests in competitive compensation and benefits programs. In addition to offering a comprehensive suite of benefits ranging from medical and dental coverage to retirement, disability and life insurance programs, AbbVie also provides health promotion programs, mental health awareness campaigns and employee assistance programs in several countries, financial wellness support, on-site health screenings and immunizations in several countries and on-site fitness and rehabilitation centers. In 2022, AbbVie launched on-site health care clinics at certain locations, offering convenient and affordable access to quality healthcare, flu shots and vaccines. In addition, the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund (a part of the AbbVie Foundation) supports two programs for global employees: the AbbVie Possibilities Scholarship for children of employees, which is an annual merit-based scholarship for use at accredited colleges, universities or vocational-technical schools; and the Employee Relief Program, which is financial assistance to support short term needs of employees when faced with large-scale disasters (e.g. a hurricane), individual disasters (e.g. a home fire) or financial hardship (e.g. the death of a spouse). Finally, AbbVie empowers managers and their teams with tools, tips and guidelines on effectively managing workloads, managing teams from a distance and supporting flexible work practices. In 2022, we implemented ""Where We Work"", AbbVie's hybrid work model, offering eligible employees predictable flexibility. New AbbVie employees are given a tailored onboarding experience for faster integration and to support performance. One of AbbVie's mentorship programs allows employees to self-nominate as mentors or mentees and facilitates meaningful relationships supporting employees’ career and development goals. 2022 Form 10-K | 12 AbbVie also provides structured, broad-based development opportunities, focusing on high-performance skills and leadership training. AbbVie's talent philosophy holds leaders accountable for building a high-performing organization, and the company provides development opportunities for all levels of leadership. AbbVie's Learn, Develop, Perform program offers year-long, self-directed leadership education, supplemented with tools and resources, and leverages leaders as role models and teachers. In addition, a foundational success factor to AbbVie's leadership pipeline is the company's Professional Development Programs, which attract graduates, postgraduates and post-doctoral talent to participate in formal development programs lasting up to three years, with the objective of strengthening functional and leadership capabilities. Culture. AbbVie’s shared values of transforming lives, acting with integrity, driving innovation, embracing diversity and inclusion and serving the community form the core of the company's culture. AbbVie articulates the behaviors associated with these values in the Ways We Work, a core set of working behaviors that emphasize how the company achieves results is equally as important as achieving them. The Ways We Work are designed to ensure that every AbbVie employee is aware of the company's cultural expectations. AbbVie integrates the Ways We Work into all talent processes, forming the basis for assessing performance, prioritizing development and ultimately rewarding employees. AbbVie believes its culture creates strong engagement, which is measured regularly through a confidential, third-party all-employee survey, and this engagement supports AbbVie’s mission of making a remarkable impact on people’s lives. Equity, Equality, Diversity & Inclusion (EED&I). A cornerstone of AbbVie’s human capital management approach is to prioritize fostering an inclusive and diverse workforce. Recently, AbbVie adopted a five-year Equality, Diversity & Inclusion roadmap that defines key global focus areas, objectives and associated initiatives, and includes implementation plans organized by business function and geography. AbbVie’s senior leaders have adopted formal goals aligned with executing this strategy. In recent years, AbbVie's board of directors has prioritized oversight of AbbVie's response to the U.S. racial justice movement, including overseeing internal programs designed to ensure that AbbVie is attracting, retaining and developing diverse talent. Through December 2022, women represented 52 percent of management positions globally and in the United States, 37 percent of AbbVie's workforce was comprised of members of historically underrepresented populations, an increase from 2021. Further, AbbVie is committed to pay equity and conducts pay equity analyses annually. A critical component of AbbVie's strategy is to instill an inclusive mindset in all AbbVie leaders and employees, so the company continues to realize the full value of its diverse workforce from recruitment through retirement. AbbVie's Employee Resource Groups also help the company nurture an inclusive culture by building community and creating connections and opportunities for mentoring, professional development, talent attraction and networking. In 2021, AbbVie reiterated its commitment to racial equality and social justice by, among other things, expanding its employee matching program to $3-to-$1 for donations to civil rights nonprofits fostering racial equity and by reaffirming its commitment to clinical trial diversity. Additional information about AbbVie's efforts on racial equality and social justice is provided on the company's website at: https://abbvie.com/our-company/equality-inclusion-diversity/our-commitment-to-racial-justice.html. Internet Information Copies of AbbVie's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through AbbVie's investor relations website ( investors.abbvie.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after AbbVie electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 13 | 2022 Form 10-K If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline. Risks Related to AbbVie's Business The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses, including the loss of exclusivity for Humira and increased competition from biosimilars, may adversely affect AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings. AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products. As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products continue to expand into the biotechnology field and form partnerships to pursue biosimilars. Companies have developed and are developing biosimilars that compete with AbbVie’s biologic products, including Humira. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVie’s biologic products, AbbVie’s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration of or successful challenges to AbbVie’s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face increased litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products. For example, Humira accounted for approximately 37% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2022. Humira is facing competition from biosimilar products in the United States beginning in 2023 due to the loss of exclusivity, which AbbVie anticipates will cause a significant decline in Humira's revenue and could adversely affect AbbVie’s revenues and operating earnings. AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""Business—Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity"" and Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations,"" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings."" AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings. A significant portion of AbbVie's revenue and operating earnings are derived from several major products. Third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie's patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses may diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is 2022 Form 10-K | 14 successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. In addition, in its pursuit of valid business opportunities, AbbVie may be required to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that it believes were improperly granted. Resolving an intellectual property infringement or other claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products. Such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture or the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for regulatory approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations. Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer. AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""Business—Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future. AbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, as well as federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, contribute to pricing pressures. In particular, the Inflation Reduction Act of 15 | 2022 Form 10-K 2022 requires (i) the government to negotiate prices for select high expenditure Medicare Part D drugs (prices effective beginning in 2026) and Part B drugs (prices effective beginning in 2028), (ii) manufacturers to pay a rebate for Medicare Part B and Part D drugs when prices for those drugs increase faster than inflation beginning in 2022 for Part D and 2023 for Part B, and (iii) a Medicare Part D redesign replacing the current coverage gap provisions and establishing a $2,000 cap for out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries beginning in 2025, with manufacturers being responsible for 10% of costs up to the $2,000 cap and 20% after that cap is reached. The Inflation Reduction Act is to be implemented through forthcoming agency action, the outcome of which cannot be reasonably determined with certainty. Additionally, changes to U.S. tax laws now require (i) a 15% minimum tax generally applied to U.S. corporations on adjusted financial statement income beginning in 2023 and (ii) a non-deductible 1% excise tax provision on net stock repurchases, to be applied to repurchases beginning in 2023. AbbVie continues to evaluate the impact that the Inflation Reduction Act may have on the company. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries may result in additional pricing pressures. In major markets worldwide, governments play a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries' pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in revenues and operating earnings. Rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products. AbbVie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of AbbVie's commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and current governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. As a result, manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics—including Humira and Skyrizi —could have a negative impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations. New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that research, develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti- 2022 Form 10-K | 16 TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available hepatitis C treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie’s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. In addition, as AbbVie products lose exclusivity, competition surrounding such products will increase and generic and biosimilar products will increasingly penetrate the markets. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, have lower prices or better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels, or have superior performance features than AbbVie’s products, and this may negatively impact AbbVie’s business and results of operations. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, such batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. AbbVie uses raw materials and components in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes, including those sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those raw materials and components could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie uses raw materials and components in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that may be sourced from single suppliers. The failure of AbbVie's suppliers, and particularly its single-source suppliers, to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Increases in demand on any of AbbVie's suppliers could result in delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of its products and/or product shortages, leading to lost revenue. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve AbbVie's use of such alternatives. Business interruption insurance may not provide adequate compensation in the case of a failure by a supplier. Certain aspects of AbbVie’s operations are highly dependent upon third party service providers. AbbVie relies on suppliers, vendors and other third party service providers to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, promote and sell its products. Reliance on third party manufacturers reduces AbbVie’s oversight and control of the manufacturing process. Some of these third party providers are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, privacy and security risks and market risks of their own. The failure of a critical third party service provider to meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie’s operations and results. If any third party service providers have violated or are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations to AbbVie, it is possible that AbbVie could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences. Significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial condition. Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies may also be conducted, which may be sponsored by AbbVie but could also be sponsored by competitors, insurance companies, government institutions, scientists, investigators or other interested parties. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend 17 | 2022 Form 10-K the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities and regulatory action could be taken by such regulatory authorities. Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of similar AbbVie products. New data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to actual or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's products. AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may adversely affect its business, results of operations and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's current or historical products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. For example, lawsuits are pending against Allergan, AbbVie’s subsidiary, and certain of its former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan’s textured breast implants. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product in question, lower revenue and exposure to other claims. AbbVie evaluates its risks and has determined that the cost of obtaining product liability insurance outweighs the likely benefits of the coverage that is available and, as such, AbbVie's product liability losses are self-insured. AbbVie is also the subject of other claims, legal proceedings and investigations in the ordinary course of business, which relate to intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters. Adverse outcomes in such claims, legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect AbbVie’s business, results of operations and reputation. For example, Allergan was named as a defendant in approximately 3,000 matters relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain relievers. Allergan recently agreed to a nationwide settlement to resolve such matters, which will provide for up to $2.02 billion to help support state and local efforts to address opioid-related issues in the United States, among other things. However, AbbVie cannot guarantee that the conditions to such settlement will be satisfied, or that additional suits will not be filed. See Note 15, ""Legal Proceedings and Contingencies"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these proceedings. AbbVie is subject to governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. AbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in Item 1, ""Business—Regulation—Discovery and Clinical Development,” “Business—Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing,” and “Business—Regulation—Medical Devices.” The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals may not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs. The U.S. healthcare industry, in particular, is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial regulatory changes. It is expected that the U.S. healthcare industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as well as political and legal action, as future proposals to reform the healthcare system are considered by the executive branch, Congress and state legislatures. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty when additional changes in the healthcare industry in general, or the pharmaceutical industry in particular, will occur, or what the impact of such changes may be. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act is to be implemented through forthcoming agency action, the outcome of which cannot be reasonably determined with certainty. In addition, AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. 2022 Form 10-K | 18 Possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to AbbVie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls or seizures of AbbVie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of AbbVie's or its suppliers' facilities while AbbVie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt AbbVie's business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices, and restrict its operations. The health care industry is subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursements, rebates, price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse. In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act, the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the TRICARE program, the government pricing rules applicable to the Medicaid, Medicare Part B, 340B Drug Pricing Program and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of such laws and regulations may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. Such violations may also lead to product recalls and seizures, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, delays or denials in the approvals of new products or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the issues, and reputational harm, any of which would adversely affect AbbVie's business. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require AbbVie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws and regulations, or allegations of such violations, could impose new obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices and restrict its operations. Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie’s operations and financial condition. Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie’s operations and financial condition. The pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) caused many countries, including the United States, to declare national emergencies and implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lock-down orders. The continuation or re-implementation of these bans and orders remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic caused AbbVie to modify certain of its business practices, and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVie’s employees, patients, customers and business partners. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie’s operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to date was not material, AbbVie experienced lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. The impact of COVID-19 and other public health outbreaks on AbbVie over the long-term is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 or any other public health outbreak on AbbVie’s operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of the disease globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to it and the resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 or any other public health outbreak may not completely prevent AbbVie's business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain. The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. AbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Net revenues outside of the United States made up approximately 21% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2022. The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States include: • fluctuations in currency exchange rates; • changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs and pricing restrictions; • multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its products; • differing local product preferences and product requirements; • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; 19 | 2022 Form 10-K • international trade disruptions or disputes; • difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations; • differing labor regulations; • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; • political and economic instability, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; • sovereign debt issues; • price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action and regulation; • inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates; • restrictions on transfers of funds; • potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries; and • potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. In particular, in February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. In response thereto, the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organizations member states, as well as certain non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions, embargoes and export controls on Russia and Belarus. Although AbbVie is continuing to supply essential pharmaceutical products in Russia for humanitarian reasons while working to maintain compliance with evolving international sanctions, it has suspended operations for all aesthetics products in Russia. AbbVie's operations in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are not significant. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the continued consequences of this conflict, which, in addition to sanctions, have included regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets. Any such consequences could have an adverse impact on AbbVie's business and results of operations . If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. AbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. AbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, joint ventures and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Additionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, joint ventures, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in 2022 Form 10-K | 20 greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate. AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its business and results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial or other difficulties. In 2022, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. The amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow AbbVie's business. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase further. In addition, AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt. AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions. For example, it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities. The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors, and AbbVie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If AbbVie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, AbbVie may be unable to fund its expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect AbbVie's business. If AbbVie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of, or significant disruption to, those systems could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business, which may be vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may in the future result in the failure of critical business operations. Such breaches may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. To date, neither AbbVie’s business nor operations have been materially impacted by such incidents. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that such efforts will prevent material breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business. Such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue or the loss of critical or sensitive information from AbbVie’s or third-party providers’ databases or IT systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business harm to AbbVie and potentially substantial remediation costs. In addition, while AbbVie maintains cyber insurance, it cannot guarantee that such insurance will be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of AbbVie systems. AbbVie’s balances of intangible assets, including developed product rights and goodwill acquired, are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges, which may adversely affect AbbVie’s results of operations and financial condition. A significant amount of AbbVie’s total assets is related to acquired intangibles and goodwill. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of AbbVie’s developed product rights and other intangible assets was $67.4 billion and the carrying value of AbbVie’s goodwill was $32.2 billion. AbbVie’s developed product rights are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. AbbVie determines original fair value and amortization periods for developed product rights based on its assessment of various factors impacting estimated 21 | 2022 Form 10-K useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products. Significant adverse changes to any of these factors require AbbVie to perform an impairment test on the affected asset and, if evidence of impairment exists, require AbbVie to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset. For assets that are not impaired, AbbVie may adjust the remaining useful lives. Such a charge could adversely affect AbbVie’s results of operations and financial condition. AbbVie’s other significant intangible assets include in-process research and development (IPR&D) intangible projects, acquired in recent business combinations, which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. For IPR&D assets, the risk of failure is significant, and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products. AbbVie's ability to realize value on these significant investments is often contingent upon, among other things, regulatory approvals and market conditions. As such, IPR&D assets may become impaired and/or be written off at some point in the future if the associated research and development effort is abandoned or is curtailed. Goodwill and AbbVie’s IPR&D intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or when events occur, or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset. Impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying amount. A goodwill or IPR&D impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s results of operations and financial condition. Failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could affect AbbVie’s ability to successfully develop and commercialize products. AbbVie’s success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract, develop and retain diverse, highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical research and development, governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense and increasing. AbbVie cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase. The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or unregistered versions of AbbVie products could have a material adverse impact on its reputation, business and results of operations. Third parties may illegally obtain, distribute, and sell counterfeit or illegally diverted from their intended market versions of AbbVie products. These versions of product would not meet AbbVie's rigorous manufacturing, testing, distribution and quality standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit, stolen, or diverted drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. The prevalence of counterfeit/diverted medicines is an industry-wide issue due to a variety of factors, including the adoption of e-commerce, which increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, greatly enhancing consumers' ability to obtain prescriptions and other medical treatments via the internet in lieu of traditional brick and mortar pharmacies. This can expose patients to greater risks as the internet is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit/diverted product offers and scams because of the anonymity it affords. AbbVie's reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or diverted drugs sold under its brand name which may also result in reduced revenues that could negatively affect our results of operation. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including: • changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, data privacy laws, particularly in the European Union and the United States and environmental laws; • differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits, stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount; • changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts; • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts; • environmental liabilities in connection with AbbVie’s manufacturing processes and distribution logistics, including the handling of hazardous materials; 2022 Form 10-K | 22 • changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie; • the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving environmental, social and governance objectives; • information loss or damage to AbbVie's reputation, brand, image or goodwill due to increased use of social media platforms; • business interruptions stemming from natural disasters, such as climate change, earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, fires, or efforts taken by third parties to prevent or mitigate such disasters; and • changes in business, economic and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups. Risks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock AbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock or the repurchase of its common stock. Although AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5, ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares under its share repurchase program will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future. An AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in the future. In the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits plans. In addition, AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes AbbVie to issue, without the approval of AbbVie's stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over AbbVie's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as AbbVie's board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. Certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading price of AbbVie's common stock. AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: • the inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting; • the division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term; 23 | 2022 Form 10-K • a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause; • the ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on AbbVie's board of directors; and • the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80% of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock. AbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 2022 Form 10-K | 24 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters.

This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" This section of Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview AbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers system to agree on reimbursement terms. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment and has approximately 50,000 employees. 2022 Financial Results AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2022 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $58.1 billion, operating earnings of $18.1 billion, diluted earnings per share of $6.63 and cash flows from operations of $24.9 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased by 3% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across its immunology, neuroscience and aesthetics portfolios. Diluted earnings per share in 2022 was $6.63 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $6.4 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $2.8 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $2.0 billion for charges related to litigation matters; (iv) $766 million of acquisition and integration expenses; and (v) $604 million related to intangible asset impairment. These costs were partially offset by an after-tax gain of $126 million related to the divestiture of Pylera and a benefit of $26 million related to certain tax items. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands. Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition in 2020, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. As a result of the successful execution of the integration plan, AbbVie realized $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022. To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie incurred total cumulative charges of $2.3 billion through 2022. These costs consisted of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses. 2022 Form 10-K | 32 Recent Global Events Russia/Ukraine In response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, as well as certain non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions and export controls on Russia and Belarus. These include restrictions on the export and transfer of products containing certain toxins, including Botox, to Russia and Belarus. However, AbbVie is not prohibited to continue the sale of essential pharmaceutical products to help ensure patients receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. In March 2022, AbbVie announced the suspension of operations for all aesthetics products in Russia. In April 2022, AbbVie also announced that all profits from the sales of essential medicines in Russia will be donated to support direct humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine. While the company’s operations in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are not significant, if the conflict escalates and results in broader economic and political concerns, AbbVie’s business could be adversely impacted. Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) In response to COVID-19, AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie continues to experience lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and is dependent on numerous evolving factors, including the measures being taken by authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants and the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics. 2023 Strategic Objectives AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to execute its strategy and advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) generating substantial operating cash flows to support investment in innovative research and development, and return cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months. AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through: • Skyrizi and Rinvoq revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion. • Advancing our hematologic oncology portfolio by increasing Venclexta market share and new indications, strong commercial execution of new product launches and effectively managing market and competitive challenges impacting Imbruvica. • Continuing investment in the global expansion of aesthetics and increasing market penetration of Botox and Juvederm Collection. • Neuroscience revenue growth driven by Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic, Ubrelvy and Qulipta. • Maximizing AbbVie's existing eye care portfolio. • Effectively managing the impact of Humira biosimilar erosion. • The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2023. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7. 33 | 2022 Form 10-K Research and Development Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline currently includes over 80 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. Of these programs, approximately 50 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months. Significant Programs and Developments Immunology Skyrizi • In January 2022, AbbVie announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Skyrizi for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis. • In June 2022, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Skyrizi for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. • In November 2022, AbbVie announced that the European Commission (EC) approved Skyrizi for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to conventional or biologic therapy. Rinvoq • In January 2022, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Rinvoq for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and children 12 years of age and older whose disease did not respond to previous treatment and is not well controlled with other pills or injections, including biologic medicines, or when use of other pills or injections is not recommended. • In February 2022, AbbVie announced top-line results from its second Phase 3 induction study, U-Excel, for Rinvoq in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease who had an inadequate response or were intolerant to conventional or biologic therapy met the primary and most key secondary endpoints. • In March 2022, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. • In April 2022, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers. • In May 2022, AbbVie announced positive top-line results from U-ENDURE, a Phase 3 maintenance study for Rinvoq in adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who had an inadequate response or were intolerant to a conventional or biologic therapy. The results showed that more patients treated with Rinvoq achieved the co-primary and secondary endpoints at one year compared to placebo. • In July 2022, AbbVie announced that the EC approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent. • In July 2022, AbbVie announced its submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA and a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the EMA for Rinvoq for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. • In July 2022, AbbVie announced that the EC approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adult patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). 2022 Form 10-K | 34 • In October 2022, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active nr-axSpA with objective signs of inflammation who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to TNF blocker therapy. • In November 2022, AbbVie announced that the EMA's Committee for Medical Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted an opinion following a review of the benefit-risk of medicines within the JAK inhibitor class for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including Rinvoq. Confirming the recommendation from the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), the CHMP did not recommend changes to the current Rinvoq indication statements and recommended updates to dosage and special warnings for all JAK inhibitor products indicated for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

The following discussion and analysis of AbbVie's net revenues by product is presented on a constant currency basis. Global Humira sales increased 4% in 2022 primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, partially offset by direct biosimilar competition in international markets. In the United States, Humira sales increased 7% in 2022 primarily driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing. This increase was partially offset by a lower market share following the corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 15% in 2022 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition. On January 31, 2023, Humira lost exclusivity in the United States. Following this loss of exclusivity, AbbVie expects direct biosimilar competition and Humira net revenues to decline in the United States. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies to maintain broad formulary access of Humira and manage the impact of biosimilar erosion. Net revenues for Skyrizi increased 78% in 2022 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch as a treatment for plaque psoriasis as well as market growth. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Skyrizi for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Net revenues for Rinvoq increased 58% in 2022 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis as well as market growth. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Rinvoq for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. Net revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues decreased 16% in 2022 as a result of decreased market demand and lower market share in the United States. The decrease in net revenues was also partially offset by increased collaboration revenues. Net revenues for Venclexta increased 16% in 2022 primarily due to continued expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with CLL and acute myeloid leukemia. 39 | 2022 Form 10-K Net revenues for Botox Cosmetic increased 21% in 2022 due to sustained consumer demand in the United States, which was moderated in the second half of the year by economic pressures impacting consumer discretionary spending, and increased investment in key international markets. Net revenues for Juvederm Collection decreased 2% in 2022 due to economic pressures impacting consumer discretionary spending and increased pricing promotions to support the market. International net revenues increased by 9% due to increased investment in key markets, partially offset by the suspension of aesthetic operations in Russia and the impact of COVID-19 in China. Net revenues for Botox Therapeutic increased 13% in 2022 due to market growth. Net revenues for Vraylar increased 18% in 2022 due to higher market share and market growth. Net revenues for Ubrelvy increased 23% in 2022 primarily due to increased market share uptake since launch, partially offset by unfavorable pricing. Net revenues for Qulipta increased greater than 100% in 2022 due to strong volume and market share uptake since launch for the preventative treatment of episodic migraine in adults. Net revenues for Mavyret decreased 5% in 2022 due to the continued disruption of global hepatitis C virus markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross Margin Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 Gross margin $ 40,640 $ 38,751 $ 30,417 5 % 27 % as a percent of net revenues 70 % 69 % 66 % Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2022 increased compared to 2021. Gross margin percentage for 2022 was favorably impacted by changes in product mix, partially offset by an intangible asset impairment charge of $770 million. Selling, General and Administrative Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 Selling, general and administrative $ 15,260 $ 12,349 $ 11,299 24 % 9 % as a percent of net revenues 26 % 22 % 25 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to the unfavorable impact of litigation reserve charges of $2.5 billion, partially offset by leverage from revenue growth and increased synergies realized. Research and Development and Acquired IPR&D and Milestones Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 Research and development $ 6,510 $ 6,922 $ 6,379 (6) % 9 % as a percent of net revenues 11 % 12 % 14 % Acquired IPR&D and milestones $ 697 $ 1,124 $ 1,376 (38) % (18) % R&D expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2022 compared to 2021. R&D expense percentage for 2022 was favorably impacted by increased scale of the combined company and synergies realized, the purchase of priority review vouchers from third parties in the prior year as well as lower integration costs related to the acquisition of Allergan. Acquired IPR&D and milestones expense represents upfront and subsequent development milestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&D projects through R&D collaborations, licensing arrangements or other asset acquisitions. Acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in 2022 included a charge of $130 million related to acquiring Syndesi Therapeutics SA, charges related to other upfront payments totaling $315 million and development milestones of $252 million. Acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in 2021 included a charge of $400 million related to exercising the company's exclusive right to acquire TeneoOne, a charge of $370 million related to a collaboration 2022 Form 10-K | 40 agreement with REGENXBIO Inc, charges related to other upfront payments totaling $192 million and development milestones of $162 million. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other Operating Expense, Net Other operating expense, net in 2022 included a one-time charge of $229 million related to an asset divested as part of the Allergan acquisition, partially offset by $172 million of income related to the sale of worldwide commercial rights of a mature brand Pylera. Other operating expense, net in 2021 included a $500 million charge related to the extension of the Calico Life Sciences LLC collaboration. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other Non-Operating Expenses years ended December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Interest expense $ 2,230 $ 2,423 $ 2,454 Interest income (186) (39) (174) Interest expense, net $ 2,044 $ 2,384 $ 2,280 Net foreign exchange loss $ 148 $ 51 $ 71 Other expense, net 2,448 2,500 5,614 Interest expense in 2022 decreased compared to 2021 primarily due to a lower average debt balance as a result of deleveraging, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. Interest income in 2022 increased compared to 2021 primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates. Other expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $2.8 billion in 2022 and $2.7 billion in 2021. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. In 2022, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2021, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, favorable clinical trial results and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 12% in 2022, 11% in 2021 and negative 36% in 2020. The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities and changes in fair value of contingent consideration. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico tax credits relate to excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. In 2022, Puerto Rico enacted Act 52-2002 (the “Puerto Rico Act”) allowing for a transition from a Puerto Rico excise tax levied on gross inventory purchases to an income-based tax beginning in 2023. The company completed the transition requirements of the Puerto Rico Act in 2022, resulting in the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on income tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The net tax benefit from the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Puerto Rico Act was $323 million. FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Cash flows provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 24,943 $ 22,777 $ 17,588 Investing activities (623) (2,344) (37,557) Financing activities (24,803) (19,039) (11,501) Operating cash flows in 2022 increased from 2021 primarily due to improved results of operations resulting from revenue growth and lower income tax payments, partially offset by the timing of working capital. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie’s contributions to its defined benefit plans of $357 million in 2022 and $376 million in 2021. 41 | 2022 Form 10-K Investing cash flows in 2022 included payments made for capital expenditures of $695 million, other acquisitions and investments of $539 million, $255 million cash consideration paid to acquire DJS Antibodies Ltd offset by cash acquired and net sales and maturities of investments securities totaling $92 million. Investment cash flows in 2021 included $535 million cash consideration paid to acquire Soliton, Inc. offset by cash acquired, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion, capital expenditures of $787 million and net purchases of investment securities totaling $21 million.

Financing cash flows also included repayment of $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes, $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes, $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.15% senior notes and $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes at maturity. Additionally, financing cash flows included repayment of a $1.0 billion floating rate term loan due May 2023 and issuance of a new $1.0 billion floating rate term loan as part of the term loan refinancing in September 2021. Financing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $10.0 billion in 2022 and $9.3 billion in 2021. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase of the dividend rate. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. AbbVie repurchased 8 million shares for $1.1 billion in 2022 and 6 million shares for $670 million in 2021. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. On February 16, 2023, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase authorization. No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2022 or 2021 and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. Credit Risk AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables. Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility AbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2022, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 2022 Form 10-K | 42 Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. Credit Ratings In 2022, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded AbbVie's senior unsecured long-term credit rating to Baa1 from Baa2, affirmed its Prime-2 short-term credit rating and revised its outlook to positive from stable. In addition, Standard and Poor's Global Ratings revised its outlook to positive from stable and affirmed its long-term issuer credit rating of BBB+. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt. Future Cash Requirements Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022: (in millions) Total Current Long-term Long-term debt, including current portion $ 63,128 $ 4,132 $ 58,996 Interest on long-term debt (a) 28,445 2,363 26,082 Contingent consideration liabilities (b) 16,384 1,469 14,915 (a) Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2022. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2022. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2022. (b) Includes contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. AbbVie enters into certain unconditional purchase obligations and other commitments in the normal course of business. There have been no changes to these commitments that would have a material impact on the company’s ability to meet either short-term or long-term future cash requirements. Income Taxes Future income tax cash requirements include a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax liability was $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and is payable in four future annual installments. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. It is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits. Quarterly Cash Dividend On October 28, 2022, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.41 per share to $1.48 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2023, to stockholders of record as of January 13, 2023. This reflects an increase of approximately 5.0% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, 43 | 2022 Form 10-K declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. Collaborations, Licensing and Other Arrangements AbbVie enters into collaborative, licensing and other arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $41.4 billion in 2022, $33.9 billion in 2021 and $27.0 billion in 2020. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings. 2022 Form 10-K | 44 The following table is an analysis of the three largest accruals for rebates and chargebacks, which comprise approximately 94% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2022. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (in millions) Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Managed Care Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,765 $ 1,936 $ 686 Additions (a) 1,266 649 71 Provisions 6,715 8,656 8,677 Payments (6,801) (8,334) (8,693) Balance at December 31, 2020 2,945 2,907 741 Provisions 9,622 11,306 11,286 Payments (8,751) (11,116) (11,125) Balance at December 31, 2021 3,816 3,097 902 Provisions 11,713 14,119 13,070 Payments (10,331) (12,974) (12,829) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 5,198 $ 4,242 $ 1,143 (a) Represents rebate accruals and chargeback allowances assumed in the Allergan acquisition. Other Allowances Other allowances include cash discounts, product returns, sales incentives, and other adjustments, which are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. Reserves for cash discounts and sales incentives are readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Cash discounts totaled $1.8 billion in 2022, $1.6 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2020. Allowances other than cash discounts are not significant. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. 45 | 2022 Form 10-K AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2022. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2023 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022: 50 basis point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease Defined benefit plans Net periodic benefit cost $ (34) $ 57 Projected benefit obligation (612) 687 Other post-employment plans Net periodic benefit cost $ (5) $ 6 Projected benefit obligation (44) 49 The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2022 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2023. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2023 by $98 million. The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2022 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2023. Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. In-process research and development (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative 2022 Form 10-K | 46 future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease projected cash flows and the estimated fair value of the related intangible assets. Future changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Contingent Consideration The fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs, which are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. 47 | 2022 Form 10-K ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021: 2022 2021 as of December 31 (in millions) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 8,507 1.071 $ 9 $ 10,253 1.155 $ 195 Canadian dollar 1,302 1.312 40 571 1.258 9 British pound 772 1.234 (8) 605 1.331 9 Chinese yuan 596 7.024 (5) 673 6.400 (1) Japanese yen 567 133.3 (3) 602 113.3 9 All other currencies 1,954 n/a (2) 1,549 n/a 5 Total $ 13,698 $ 31 $ 14,253 $ 226 The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.4 billion at December 31, 2022. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2022, the company has €5.9 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate Risk The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $155 million at December 31, 2022. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $4.2 billion at December 31, 2022. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. 2022 Form 10-K | 48 ITEM 8.

Financial Statements Note 1 Background Background The principal business of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of a broad line of therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to wholesalers or through distributors, and depending on the market works through largely centralized national payers system to agree on reimbursement terms. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100 % of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding this acquisition. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration liabilities, financial instruments and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. During 2022, AbbVie revised its classification of development milestone expense associated with licensing and collaboration arrangements in the consolidated statements of earnings. Milestone payments incurred prior to regulatory approval, which were previously included in research and development (R&D) expense, are now presented as acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. The reclassification decreased R&D expense and increased acquired IPR&D and milestones expense by $ 162 million in 2021 and $ 178 million in 2020. The company believes this presentation assists users of the financial statements to better understand the total upfront and subsequent development milestone payments incurred to acquire in-process research and development projects. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Certain other reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an 55 | 2022 Form 10-K expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less. Cash discounts, rebates and chargebacks, sales incentives, product returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. In addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography. Research and Development Expenses Internal R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Acquired IPR&D and Milestones Expenses In an asset acquisition, payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&D projects are expensed as acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include upfront and development milestone payments related to R&D collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other asset acquisitions that provide rights to develop, manufacture and/or sell pharmaceutical products. Where contingent development milestone payments are due to third parties, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product. Business Combinations AbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the acquisition date and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. In a business combination, the fair value of IPR&D projects acquired is capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&D costs incurred by the company after the acquisition are expensed to R&D as incurred. Collaborations and Other Arrangements The company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements and subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of development milestones prior to regulatory approval are expensed to acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred. 2022 Form 10-K | 56 Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $ 2.0 billion in 2022, $ 2.1 billion in 2021 and $ 1.8 billion in 2020. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are generally amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five-year period. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre-tax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Investments Investments consist primarily of equity securities, held-to-maturity debt securities, marketable debt securities and time deposits. Investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at cost. Gains or losses on investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until realized, at which time the gains or losses are recognized in earnings. AbbVie periodically assesses its marketable debt securities for impairment and credit losses. When a decline in fair value of marketable debt security is due to credit related factors, an allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. When AbbVie determines that a non-credit related impairment has occurred, the amortized cost basis of the investment, net of allowance for credit losses, is written down with a charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and an available-for-sale investment's unrealized loss is reclassified from AOCI to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any impairments and credit losses that were recorded in net earnings. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable and is determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, other currently available information including customer financial condition and both current and forecasted economic conditions. 57 | 2022 Form 10-K Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Cost includes material and conversion costs. Inventories consisted of the following: as of December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 Finished goods $ 1,162 $ 932 Work-in-process 1,417 1,193 Raw materials 1,000 1,003 Inventories $ 3,579 $ 3,128 Property and Equipment as of December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 Land $ 286 $ 287 Buildings 2,737 2,791 Equipment 7,107 6,850 Construction in progress 856 799 Property and equipment, gross 10,986 10,727 Less accumulated depreciation ( 6,051 ) ( 5,617 ) Property and equipment, net $ 4,935 $ 5,110 Depreciation for property and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life for buildings ranges from 10 to 50 years. Buildings include leasehold improvements which are amortized over the lesser of the remainder of the lease term or the useful life of the leasehold improvement. The estimated useful life for equipment ranges from 2 to 25 years. Equipment includes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use and is amortized over 3 to 10 years. Depreciation expense was $ 778 million in 2022, $ 803 million in 2021 and $ 666 million in 2020. Leases Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. For leases commencing or modified in 2019 or later, AbbVie does not separate lease components from non-lease components. The company records lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. AbbVie generally uses an incremental borrowing rate to discount its lease liabilities, as the rate implicit in the lease is typically not readily determinable. Certain lease agreements include renewal options that are under the company's control. AbbVie includes optional renewal periods in the lease term only when it is reasonably certain that AbbVie will exercise its option. Variable lease payments include payments to lessors for taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs as well as payments that are adjusted based on an index or rate. The company's lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Litigation and Contingencies Loss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash 2022 Form 10-K | 58 flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease projected cash flows and the estimated fair value of the related intangible assets. Future changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar affects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. For derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. The company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI. Derivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. 59 | 2022 Form 10-K Note 3 Supplemental Financial Information Interest Expense, Net years ended December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Interest expense $ 2,230 $ 2,423 $ 2,454 Interest income ( 186 ) ( 39 ) ( 174 ) Interest expense, net $ 2,044 $ 2,384 $ 2,280 Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 Sales rebates $ 10,717 $ 8,254 Dividends payable 2,680 2,543 Accounts payable 2,934 2,882 Current portion of contingent consideration liabilities 1,469 1,249 Salaries, wages and commissions 1,371 1,785 Royalty and license arrangements 412 661 Other 5,819 5,325 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 25,402 $ 22,699 Other Long-Term Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 Contingent consideration liabilities $ 14,915 $ 13,638 Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 6,502 5,970 Income taxes payable 2,985 3,442 Pension and other post-employment benefits 1,638 3,153 Other 4,615 2,498 Other long-term liabilities $ 30,655 $ 28,701 2022 Form 10-K | 60 Note 4 Earnings Per Share AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive. The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method: Years ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 2020 Basic EPS Net earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 11,836 $ 11,542 $ 4,616 Earnings allocated to participating securities 54 74 60 Earnings available to common shareholders $ 11,782 $ 11,468 $ 4,556 Weighted average basic shares of common stock outstanding 1,771 1,770 1,667 Basic earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 6.65 $ 6.48 $ 2.73 Diluted EPS Net earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 11,836 $ 11,542 $ 4,616 Earnings allocated to participating securities 54 74 60 Earnings available to common shareholders $ 11,782 $ 11,468 $ 4,556 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 1,771 1,770 1,667 Effect of dilutive securities 7 7 6 Weighted average diluted shares of common stock outstanding 1,778 1,777 1,673 Diluted earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 6.63 $ 6.45 $ 2.72 Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented. 61 | 2022 Form 10-K Note 5 Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements Acquisition of DJS Antibodies Ltd In October 2022, AbbVie entered into an agreement to acquire DJS Antibodies Ltd (DJS) including its lead program DJS-002 and proprietary HEPTAD platform. DJS-002 is an LPAR1 antagonist antibody currently in preclinical studies for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases. HEPTAD platform is a potential novel approach to antibody discovery with specific capabilities targeting transmembrane protein targets. The aggregate purchase price of $ 287 million was comprised of a $ 255 million upfront cash payment and $ 32 million for the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, for which AbbVie may owe up to $ 95 million in future payments upon achievement of certain development milestones. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. As of the acquisition date, AbbVie acquired $ 233 million of intangible assets for in-process research and development, $ 22 million of intangible assets for developed product rights and $ 60 million of deferred tax liabilities. Other assets and liabilities assumed were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 92 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition of Soliton, Inc. In December 2021, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of Soliton, Inc. (Soliton). Soliton's RESONIC (Rapid Acoustic Pulse device) has U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the long-term improvement in the appearance of cellulite up to one year. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Total consideration transferred allocated to the purchase price consisted of cash consideration of $ 535 million paid to holders of Soliton common stock, equity-based awards and warrants. As of the transaction date, AbbVie acquired $ 407 million of intangible assets for developed product rights and assumed deferred tax liabilities totaling $ 63 million. Other assets and liabilities were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 177 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition of Luminera In October 2020, AbbVie entered into an agreement with Luminera, a privately held aesthetics company based in Israel, to acquire Luminera's full dermal filler portfolio and R&D pipeline including HArmonyCa, a dermal filler intended for facial soft tissue augmentation. The aggregate accounting purchase price of $ 186 million was comprised of a $ 122 million upfront cash payment and $ 64 million for the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, for which AbbVie may owe up to $ 90 million in future payments upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. The agreement was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. As of the acquisition date, AbbVie acquired $ 127 million of intangible assets for in-process research and development and $ 33 million of intangible assets for developed product rights. Other assets and liabilities assumed were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 12 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition of Allergan On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its acquisition of all outstanding equity interests in Allergan in a cash and stock transaction. Allergan is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing branded pharmaceutical, device, biologic, surgical and regenerative medicine products for patients around the world. The combination created a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. Under the terms of the acquisition, each ordinary share of Allergan common stock was converted into the right to receive (i) $ 120.30 in cash and (ii) 0.8660 of a share of AbbVie common stock. Total consideration for the acquisition of Allergan is summarized as follows: (in millions) Cash consideration paid to Allergan shareholders (a) $ 39,675 Fair value of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders (b) 23,979 Fair value of AbbVie equity awards issued to Allergan equity award holders (c) 430 Total consideration $ 64,084 (a) Represents cash consideration transferred of $ 120.30 per outstanding Allergan ordinary share based on 330 million Allergan ordinary shares outstanding at closing. 2022 Form 10-K | 62 (b) Represents the acquisition date fair value of 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders based on the exchange ratio of 0.8660 AbbVie shares for each outstanding Allergan ordinary share at the May 8, 2020, closing price of $ 83.96 per share. (c) Represents the pre-acquisition service portion of the fair value of 11 million AbbVie stock options and 8 million RSUs issued to Allergan equity award holders. The acquisition of Allergan has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was finalized during the second quarter of 2021. Measurement period adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation during 2021 included (i) an increase to intangible assets of $ 710 million; (ii) an increase to deferred income tax liabilities of $ 148 million; (iii) other individually insignificant adjustments for a net increase to identifiable net assets of $ 2 million; and (iv) a corresponding decrease to goodwill of $ 564 million. The measurement period adjustments primarily resulted from the completion of the valuation of certain license agreement intangible assets based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and did not result from intervening events subsequent to such date. These adjustments did not have a significant impact on AbbVie's results of operations in 2021 and would not have had a significant impact on prior period results if these adjustments had been made as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes t he final fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date: (in millions) Assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and equivalents $ 1,537 Short-term investments 1,421 Accounts receivable 2,374 Inventories 2,340 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,982 Investments 137 Property and equipment 2,129 Intangible assets Definite-lived intangible assets 68,190 In-process research and development 1,600 Other noncurrent assets 1,395 Short-term borrowings ( 60 ) Current portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations ( 1,899 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 5,852 ) Long-term debt and finance lease obligations ( 18,937 ) Deferred income taxes ( 3,940 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 4,765 ) Total identifiable net assets 47,652 Goodwill 16,432 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 64,084 The fair value step-up adjustment to inventories of $ 1.2 billion was amortized to cost of products sold when the inventory was sold to customers and was fully amortized as of December 31, 2021. Intangible assets relate to $ 68.2 billion of definite-lived intangible assets and $ 1.6 billion of IPR&D. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately twelve years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the ""income approach"" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors. 63 | 2022 Form 10-K The fair value of long-term debt was determined by quoted market prices as of the acquisition date and the total purchase price adjustment of $ 1.3 billion is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Allergan represents the value of additional growth platforms and an expanded revenue base as well as anticipated operational synergies and cost savings from the creation of a single combined global organization. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Following the acquisition date, the operating results of Allergan have been included in the consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2020, net revenues attributable to Allergan were $ 10.3 billion and operating losses attributable to Allergan were $ 1.1 billion, inclusive of $ 4.0 billion of intangible asset amortization and $ 1.2 billion of inventory fair value step-up amortization. Acquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $ 781 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which were included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings . In the fourth quarter of 2021, AbbVie recovered certain acquisition-related regulatory fees totaling $ 401 million which was recorded as a reduction to SG&A expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021. Pro Forma Financial Information The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of AbbVie and Allergan for 2020 as if the acquisition of Allergan had occurred on January 1, 2019: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 Net revenues $ 50,521 Net earnings 6,746 The unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie and Allergan. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2019 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the final fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired; the incremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with acquisition date inventory; the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition; and the reclassification of acquisition-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2019. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition.

This strategic decision contributed to a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for the product and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate the underlying definite lived-intangible asset for impairment. The company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the intangible asset resulting in a full impairment of both the gross and net carrying amount. Based on the revised cash flows, the company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $ 770 million to cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2022. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 1 to 16 years with an average of 12 years for developed product rights and 11 years for license agreements. Amortization expense was $ 7.7 billion in 2022, $ 7.7 billion in 2021 and $ 5.8 billion in 2020 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2022 is as follows: (in billions) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Anticipated annual amortization expense $ 7.7 $ 7.9 $ 8.0 $ 7.3 $ 5.8 2022 Form 10-K | 68 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPR&D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval.

These repayments were ma de by exercising, under the terms of the notes ranging between 60 and 90-day early redemptions at 100% of the principal amount. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the company also paid $ 3.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.9 % senior notes, $ 3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.3 % senior notes and $ 750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes at maturity. Additionally in 2022, the company refinanced its $ 2.0 billion floating rate five-year term loan. As part of the refinancing, the company repaid the existing $ 2.0 billion term loan due May 2025 and borrowed $ 2.0 billion under a new term loan at a lower floating rate. All other significant terms of the loan, including the maturity date, remained unchanged after the refinancing. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the company repaid a $ 1.0 billion floating rate three-year term loan that was scheduled to mature in May 2023. In 2021, the company repaid $ 1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.3 % senior notes, € 750 million aggregate principal amount of 0.5 % senior Euro notes and $ 1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.0 % senior notes. These repayments were made by exercising, under the terms of the notes, ranging between 30 and 90-day early redemptions at 100% of the principal amounts. The company also repaid $ 1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.375 % senior notes $ 1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.15 % senior notes and $ 1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes at maturity. Additionally in 2021, the company refinanced its $ 1.0 billion floating rate three-year term loan. As part of the refinancing, the company repaid the existing $ 1.0 billion term loan due May 2023 and borrowed $ 1.0 billion under a new term loan at a lower floating rate. All other significant terms of the loan, including the maturity date, remained unchanged after the refinancing. Short-Term Borrowings There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2022 or 2021. There were commercial paper borrowings issued during 2020 and the weighted-average interest rate was 1.8 %. AbbVie currently has a $ 4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants, all of which the company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2022. Commitment fees under AbbVie's revolving credit facilities were insignificant in 2022, 2021 and 2020. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facilities as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Contingencies and Guarantees In connection with the separation, AbbVie has indemnified Abbott for all liabilities resulting from the operation of AbbVie's business other than income tax liabilities with respect to periods prior to the distribution date and other liabilities as agreed to by AbbVie and Abbott. AbbVie has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements and no special-purpose entities. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie has periodically entered into third-party agreements, such as the assignment of product rights, which have resulted in AbbVie becoming secondarily liable for obligations for which AbbVie had previously been primarily liable. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. 73 | 2022 Form 10-K Note 11 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Risk Management Policy The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. AbbVie's hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. AbbVie also periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the company's outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required. Financial Instruments Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $ 1.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and $ 1.1 billion at December 31, 2021, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2022 will be reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement. In 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $ 10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in 2019 and the resulting net gain was recognized in other comprehensive income. This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt. The company was a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges that matured in November 2022, for which the notional amount was $ 750 million at December 31, 2021. The effect of the hedge contracts was to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. Realized and unrealized gains or losses were included in AOCI and were reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt. The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $ 6.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and $ 8.2 billion at December 31, 2021. The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of € 5.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling € 4.3 billion, SEK 2.0 billion, CAD 750 million and CHF 90 million at December 31, 2022 and € 4.3 billion at December 31, 2021. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument. The company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $ 4.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. 2022 Form 10-K | 74 The following table summarizes the amounts and location of AbbVie's derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets: Fair value - Derivatives in asset position Fair value - Derivatives in liability position as of December 31 (in millions) Balance sheet caption 2022 2021 Balance sheet caption 2022 2021 Foreign currency forward exchange contracts Designated as cash flow hedges Prepaid expenses and other $ 49 $ 51 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 8 $ 2 Designated as cash flow hedges Other assets 1 — Other long-term liabilities — — Designated as net investment hedges Prepaid expenses and other 6 149 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 36 — Designated as net investment hedges Other assets 74 15 Other long-term liabilities 47 — Not designated as hedges Prepaid expenses and other 33 26 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 41 13 Interest rate swap contracts Designated as cash flow hedges Prepaid expenses and other — — Accounts payable and accrued liabilities — 7 Designated as fair value hedges Prepaid expenses and other — — Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 17 — Designated as fair value hedges Other assets — 26 Other long-term liabilities 375 15 Total derivatives $ 163 $ 267 $ 524 $ 37 While certain derivatives are subject to netting arrangements with the company's counterparties, the company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets.

Equity securities primarily consist of investments for which the fair values were determined by using the published market prices per unit multiplied by the number of units held, without consideration of transaction costs. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones 77 | 2022 Form 10-K and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs: 2022 2021 years ended December 31 (in millions) Range Weighted Average (a) Range Weighted Average (a) Discount rate 4.7 % - 5.1 % 4.8 % 0.2 % - 2.6 % 1.7 % Probability of payment for unachieved milestones 100 % - 100 % 100 % 89 % - 100 % 90 % Probability of payment for royalties by indication (b) 56 % - 100 % 99 % 56 % - 100 % 96 % Projected year of payments 2023 - 2034 2028 2022 - 2034 2027 (a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. (b) Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment was 56 % at December 31, 2022 and ranged from 56 % to 89 % at December 31, 2021. There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Beginning balance $ 14,887 $ 12,997 $ 7,340 Additions (a) 32 — 225 Change in fair value recognized in net earnings 2,761 2,679 5,753 Payments ( 1,296 ) ( 789 ) ( 321 ) Ending balance $ 16,384 $ 14,887 $ 12,997 (a) Additions during the year ended December 31, 2022, represent contingent consideration liabilities assumed in the DJS acquisition. Additions during the year ended December 31, 2020, represent contingent consideration liabilities assumed in the Allergan and Luminera acquisitions (see Note 5). The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and included charges of $ 2.8 billion in 2022, $ 2.7 billion in 2021 and $ 5.8 billion in 2020. In 2022, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2021, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, favorable clinical trial results and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2020, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, lower discount rates, the passage of time and favorable clinical trial results. 2022 Form 10-K | 78 Certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

The carrying amount of these investments was $ 129 million as of December 31, 2022 and $ 149 million as of December 31, 2021. No significant cumulative upward or downward adjustments have been recorded for these investments as of December 31, 2022. Concentrations of Risk Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 82 % as of December 31, 2022 and 75 % as of December 31, 2021, and substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product net revenues in the United States were to these three wholesalers. Humira (adalimumab) is AbbVie's single largest product and accounted for approximately 37 % of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2022, 37 % in 2021 and 43 % in 2020. 79 | 2022 Form 10-K Note 12 Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie sponsors various pension and other post-employment benefit plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. In addition, AbbVie provides medical benefits, primarily to eligible retirees in the United States and Puerto Rico, through other post-retirement benefit plans. Net obligations for these plans have been reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The following table summarizes benefit plan information for the global AbbVie-sponsored defined benefit and other post-employment plans: Defined benefit plans Other post-employment plans as of and for the years ended December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Projected benefit obligations Beginning of period $ 12,006 $ 11,792 $ 850 $ 795 Service cost 454 440 51 48 Interest cost 297 237 23 19 Employee contributions 1 2 — — Amendments — — ( 2 ) — Actuarial (gain) loss ( 3,668 ) ( 8 ) ( 229 ) 10 Benefits paid ( 294 ) ( 281 ) ( 25 ) ( 22 ) Other, primarily foreign currency translation adjustments ( 208 ) ( 176 ) ( 1 ) — End of period 8,588 12,006 667 850 Fair value of plan assets Beginning of period 10,655 9,702 — — Actual return on plan assets ( 2,031 ) 1,000 — — Company contributions 357 376 25 22 Employee contributions 1 2 — — Benefits paid ( 294 ) ( 281 ) ( 25 ) ( 22 ) Other, primarily foreign currency translation adjustments ( 216 ) ( 144 ) — — End of period 8,472 10,655 — — Funded status, end of period $ ( 116 ) $ ( 1,351 ) $ ( 667 ) $ ( 850 ) Amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheets Other assets $ 896 $ 991 $ — $ — Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 14 ) ( 13 ) ( 27 ) ( 26 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 998 ) ( 2,329 ) ( 640 ) ( 824 ) Net obligation $ ( 116 ) $ ( 1,351 ) $ ( 667 ) $ ( 850 ) Actuarial loss, net $ 2,365 $ 3,504 $ 205 $ 461 Prior service cost (credit) 3 5 ( 333 ) ( 370 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ 2,368 $ 3,509 $ ( 128 ) $ 91 Related to international defined benefit plans the projected benefit obligations in the table above included $ 2.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and $ 3.2 billion at December 31, 2021. For plans reflected in the table above, the accumulated benefit obligations were $ 7.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and $ 10.5 billion at December 31, 2021. The 2022 actuarial gain of $ 3.7 billion for qualified pension plans and actuarial gain of $ 229 million for other post-employment plans were primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate. The 2021 actuarial gain of $ 8 million for qualified pension plans and actuarial loss of $ 10 million for other post-employment plans were primarily driven by an increase in the assumed discount rate offset by change in demographic assumptions from 2020. 2022 Form 10-K | 80 Information For Pension Plans With An Accumulated Benefit Obligation In Excess Of Plan Assets as of December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 1,211 $ 6,395 Fair value of plan assets 746 5,412 Information For Pension Plans With A Projected Benefit Obligation In Excess Of Plan Assets as of December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 Projected benefit obligation $ 5,592 $ 7,788 Fair value of plan assets 4,580 5,447 AbbVie's U.S. pension plan was modified to close the plan to new entrants effective January 1, 2022. In addition, a change to AbbVie's U.S. retiree health benefit plan was approved in 2020 and communicated to employees and retirees in October 2020. Beginning in 2022, Medicare-eligible retirees and Medicare-eligible dependents choose health care coverage from insurance providers through a private Medicare exchange. AbbVie will continue to provide financial support to Medicare-eligible retirees. This change to the U.S. retiree health benefit plan decreased AbbVie's post-employment benefit obligation and increased AbbVie's unrecognized prior service credit as of December 31, 2020 by $ 397 million. 81 | 2022 Form 10-K Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income The following table summarizes the pre-tax losses (gains) included in other comprehensive income: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Defined benefit plans Actuarial loss (gain) $ ( 925 ) $ ( 345 ) $ 701 Amortization of prior service cost ( 2 ) ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Amortization of actuarial loss ( 231 ) ( 288 ) ( 227 ) Foreign exchange loss (gain) and other 17 ( 27 ) 56 Total loss (gain) $ ( 1,141 ) $ ( 662 ) $ 528 Other post-employment plans Actuarial loss (gain) $ ( 229 ) $ 10 $ 40 Prior service credit ( 2 ) — ( 397 ) Amortization of prior service credit 38 39 4 Amortization of actuarial loss ( 26 ) ( 32 ) ( 26 ) Total loss (gain) $ ( 219 ) $ 17 $ ( 379 ) Net Periodic Benefit Cost years ended December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Defined benefit plans Service cost $ 454 $ 440 $ 370 Interest cost 297 237 264 Expected return on plan assets ( 712 ) ( 663 ) ( 575 ) Amortization of prior service cost 2 2 2 Amortization of actuarial loss 231 288 227 Net periodic benefit cost $ 272 $ 304 $ 288 Other post-employment plans Service cost $ 51 $ 48 $ 42 Interest cost 23 19 34 Amortization of prior service credit ( 38 ) ( 39 ) ( 4 ) Amortization of actuarial loss 26 32 26 Net periodic benefit cost $ 62 $ 60 $ 98 The components of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.

The pre-65 rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 % ( 1.8 % post-65) in 2030 and remain at that level thereafter. For purposes of measuring the 2022 post-retirement health care costs, the company assumed a 5.9 % pre-65 ( 2.1 % post-65) annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The pre-65 rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 % ( 1.8 % post-65) for 2029 and remain at that level thereafter. 83 | 2022 Form 10-K Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions) 2022 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities U.S. large cap (a) $ 949 $ 949 $ — $ — U.S. mid cap (b) 157 157 — — International (c) 327 327 — — Fixed income securities U.S. government securities (d) 237 69 168 — Corporate debt instruments (d) 680 144 536 — Non-U.S. government securities (d) 548 402 146 — Other (d) 84 81 3 — Absolute return funds (e) 91 4 87 — Real assets 9 9 — — Other (f) 278 277 1 — Total $ 3,360 $ 2,419 $ 941 $ — Total assets measured at NAV 5,112 Fair value of plan assets $ 8,472 Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions) 2021 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities U.S. large cap (a) $ 1,428 $ 1,428 $ — $ — U.S. mid cap (b) 198 198 — — International (c) 458 458 — — Fixed income securities U.S. government securities (d) 228 95 133 — Corporate debt instruments (d) 945 179 766 — Non-U.S. government securities (d) 602 445 157 — Other (d) 273 268 5 — Absolute return funds (e) 100 5 95 — Real assets 10 10 — — Other (f) 261 216 45 — Total $ 4,503 $ 3,302 $ 1,201 $ — Total assets measured at NAV 6,152 Fair value of plan assets $ 10,655 (a) A mix of index funds and actively managed equity accounts that are benchmarked to various large cap indices.

(f) Investments in cash and cash equivalents. Equities and registered investment companies having quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are quoted at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. Investments held in pooled investment funds, common collective trusts or limited partnerships are valued at the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is provided by the fund administrator and is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are established for each plan and are generally made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The 2022 target investment allocation for the AbbVie Pension Plan was 62.5 % in equity securities, 22.5 % in fixed income securities and 15 % in asset allocation strategies and other holdings. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets of the AbbVie Pension Plan or of any other plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption for each plan is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. Expected Benefit Payments The following table summarizes total benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants including payments funded from both plan and company assets: years ending December 31 (in millions) Defined benefit plans Other post-employment plans 2023 $ 310 $ 28 2024 333 31 2025 355 34 2026 378 37 2027 404 39 2028 to 2032 2,427 244 Defined Contribution Plan AbbVie maintains defined contribution savings plans for the benefit of its eligible employees. The expense recognized for these plans was $ 474 million in 2022, $ 267 million in 2021 and $ 191 million in 2020. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees. Note 13 Equity Stock-Based Compensation In May 2021, stockholders of the company approved the AbbVie Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Program (the Amended Plan), which amends and restates the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP). AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the Amended Plan, which provides for several different forms of benefits, including non-qualified stock options, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the Amended Plan, a total of 144 million shares of AbbVie common stock have been reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees. 85 | 2022 Form 10-K AbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least 10 years of service. Stock-based compensation expense is principally related to awards issued pursuant to the 2013 ISP and the Amended Plan and is summarized as follows: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Cost of products sold $ 38 $ 46 $ 47 Research and development 232 226 247 Selling, general and administrative 401 420 459 Pre-tax compensation expense 671 692 753 Tax benefit 122 126 131 After-tax compensation expense $ 549 $ 566 $ 622 Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $ 116 million in 2022, $ 50 million in 2021 and $ 34 million in 2020. Stock Options Stock options awarded to employees typically have a contractual term of 10 years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period. The exercise price is equal to at least 100 % of the market value on the date of grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted were $ 22.83 in 2022, $ 16.28 in 2021 and $ 12.14 in 2020. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, during the second quarter of 2020, AbbVie issued 11.2 million stock options to holders of Allergan options as a result of the conversion of such options. These options were fair-valued using a lattice valuation model. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the Allergan acquisition. The following table summarizes AbbVie stock option activity in 2022: (options in thousands, aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Options Weighted- average exercise price Weighted-average remaining life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value Outstanding at December 31, 2021 12,374 $ 81.98 4.7 $ 661 Granted 863 144.54 Exercised ( 3,764 ) 70.85 Lapsed and forfeited ( 153 ) 107.65 Outstanding at December 31, 2022 9,320 $ 91.84 4.8 $ 650 Exercisable at December 31, 2022 7,120 $ 84.54 3.7 $ 549 The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 295 million in 2022, $ 239 million in 2021 and $ 186 million in 2020. The total fair value of options vested during 2022 was $ 21 million. As of December 31, 2022, $ 6 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . RSUs and Performance Shares RSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees generally vest in ratable increments over a three or four-year period. Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period. The majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and other key employees are performance-based. Equity awards granted to senior executives and other key employees consist of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares as well as non-qualified stock options described above. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a three-year performance period and may be earned based on AbbVie’s return on invested capital (ROIC) performance relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life science companies. The recipient may receive one share of AbbVie common stock for each vested award. The performance shares 2022 Form 10-K | 86 have the potential to vest over a three-year performance period and may be earned based on AbbVie’s EPS achievement and AbbVie’s total stockholder return (TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-vested RSUs and performance shares accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs and performance shares generally is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the quoted price of AbbVie’s common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table summarizes AbbVie RSU and performance share activity for 2022: (share units in thousands) Share units Weighted-average grant date fair value Outstanding at December 31, 2021 14,890 $ 94.93 Granted 5,943 138.73 Vested ( 6,958 ) 89.31 Forfeited ( 844 ) 111.45 Outstanding at December 31, 2022 13,031 $ 116.84 The fair market value of RSUs and performance shares (as applicable) vested was $ 1.0 billion in 2022, $ 718 million in 2021 and $ 618 million in 2020. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, during the second quarter of 2020, AbbVie issued 8.2 million RSUs to holders of Allergan equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the Allergan acquisition. As of December 31, 2022, $ 578 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs and performance shares is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . Cash Dividends Cash dividends declared per common share totaled $ 5.71 in 2022, $ 5.31 in 2021 and $ 4.84 in 2020. The following table summarizes quarterly cash dividends declared during 2022, 2021 and 2020: 2022 2021 2020 Date Declared Payment Date Dividend Per Share Date Declared Payment Date Dividend Per Share Date Declared Payment Date Dividend Per Share 10/28/22 02/15/23 $ 1.48 10/29/21 02/15/22 $ 1.41 10/30/20 02/16/21 $ 1.30 09/09/22 11/15/22 $ 1.41 09/10/21 11/15/21 $ 1.30 09/11/20 11/16/20 $ 1.18 06/23/22 08/15/22 $ 1.41 06/17/21 08/16/21 $ 1.30 06/17/20 08/14/20 $ 1.18 02/17/22 05/16/22 $ 1.41 02/18/21 05/14/21 $ 1.30 02/20/20 05/15/20 $ 1.18 Stock Repurchase Program The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased under these programs are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses and are available for general corporate purposes. AbbVie repurchased 8 million shares for $ 1.1 billion in 2022, 6 million shares for $ 670 million in 2021 and 8 million shares for $ 757 million in 2020. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $ 1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. On February 16, 2023, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $ 5.0 billion increase to the existing stock repurchase authorization. 87 | 2022 Form 10-K Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table summarizes the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for 2022, 2021 and 2020: (in millions) (brackets denote losses) Foreign currency translation adjustments Net investment hedging activities Pension and post-employment benefits Cash flow hedging activities Total Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ ( 928 ) $ 9 $ ( 2,965 ) $ 288 $ ( 3,596 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 1,511 ( 785 ) ( 300 ) ( 108 ) 318 Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — ( 14 ) 198 ( 23 ) 161 Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) 1,511 ( 799 ) ( 102 ) ( 131 ) 479 Balance as of December 31, 2020 583 ( 790 ) ( 3,067 ) 157 ( 3,117 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 1,153 ) 720 298 76 ( 59 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — ( 21 ) 223 75 277 Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 1,153 ) 699 521 151 218 Balance as of December 31, 2021 ( 570 ) ( 91 ) ( 2,546 ) 308 ( 2,899 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 943 ) 629 915 91 692 Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — ( 74 ) 173 ( 91 ) 8 Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 943 ) 555 1,088 — 700 Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ ( 1,513 ) $ 464 $ ( 1,458 ) $ 308 $ ( 2,199 ) Other comprehensive income for 2022 included pension and post-employment benefit plan gains of $ 1.1 billion primarily due actuarial gains driven by higher discount rates partially offset by losses on plan assets. Other comprehensive income for 2022 also included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling losses of $ 943 million principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets and the offsetting impact of net investment hedging activities totaling gains of $ 555 million. Other comprehensive income for 2021 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling losses of $ 1.2 billion principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and the offsetting impact of net investment hedging activities totaling gains of $ 699 million. Other comprehensive income for 2020 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling gains of $ 1.5 billion principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the Euro on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and the offsetting impact of net investment hedging activities totaling losses of $ 799 million. 2022 Form 10-K | 88 The table below presents the impact on AbbVie's consolidated statements of earnings for significant amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss: years ended December 31 (in millions) (brackets denote gains) 2022 2021 2020 Net investment hedging activities Gains on derivative amount excluded from effectiveness testing (a) $ ( 94 ) $ ( 26 ) $ ( 18 ) Tax expense 20 5 4 Total reclassifications, net of tax $ ( 74 ) $ ( 21 ) $ ( 14 ) Pension and post-employment benefits Amortization of actuarial losses and other (b) $ 221 $ 283 $ 251 Tax benefit ( 48 ) ( 60 ) ( 53 ) Total reclassifications, net of tax $ 173 $ 223 $ 198 Cash flow hedging activities Losses (gains) on foreign currency forward exchange contracts (c) $ ( 82 ) $ 87 $ ( 23 ) Gains on treasury rate lock agreements (a) ( 23 ) ( 24 ) ( 24 ) Losses on interest rate swap contracts (a) 1 24 17 Tax expense (benefit) 13 ( 12 ) 7 Total reclassifications, net of tax $ ( 91 ) $ 75 $ ( 23 ) (a) Amounts are included in interest expense, net (see Note 11).

The effective income tax rates in 2022, 2021 and 2020 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, tax audits and settlements and changes in fair value of contingent consideration. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico tax credits relate to excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. In 2022, Puerto Rico enacted Act 52-2002 (the Puerto Rico Act) allowing for a transition from a Puerto Rico excise tax levied on gross inventory purchases to an income-based tax beginning in 2023. The company completed the transition requirements of the Puerto Rico Act in 2022, resulting in the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on income tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. The net tax benefit from the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Puerto Rico Act was $ 323 million. The 2020 effective income tax rate included the recognition of a net tax benefit of $ 1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. 2022 Form 10-K | 90 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was signed into law in December 2017, resulting in significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, including a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously untaxed. The Act also created a minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The company’s accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings is to report the tax effects on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets Compensation and employee benefits $ 497 $ 937 Accruals and reserves 1,023 667 Chargebacks and rebates 991 837 Advance payments 547 809 Net operating losses and other carryforwards 10,391 10,095 Other 1,710 1,234 Total deferred tax assets 15,159 14,579 Valuation allowances ( 9,627 ) ( 9,391 ) Total net deferred tax assets 5,532 5,188 Deferred tax liabilities Excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets ( 3,590 ) ( 4,711 ) Excess of book basis over tax basis in investments ( 340 ) ( 308 ) Other ( 772 ) ( 904 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 4,702 ) ( 5,923 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 830 $ ( 735 ) The increase in net deferred tax assets is primarily related to capitalization of R&D expense and increases in accruals and reserves, offset by a decrease in advance payments. The decrease in deferred tax liabilities is primarily related to amortization of intangible assets. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, the company recorded adjustments within the measurement period in 2021 related to foreign net operating losses and other credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The adjustments reflected an increase of $ 8.2 billion to deferred tax assets and an offsetting increase to valuation allowances, resulting in no net impact to deferred tax assets. The company had valuation allowances of $ 9.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $ 9.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. These were principally related to foreign and state net operating losses and other credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2022, the company had U.S. federal, state and foreign credit carryforwards of $ 355 million as well as U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 33.2 billion, which will expire at various times through 2042. The remaining U.S. federal and foreign loss carryforwards of $ 6.0 billion have no expiration. The Act significantly changed the timing and manner in which earnings of foreign subsidiaries are subject to U.S. tax. Therefore, unremitted foreign earnings subject to the Act’s transition tax are not considered indefinitely reinvested. Post-2017 earnings subject to the U.S. minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings or eligible for the 100 percent foreign dividends received deduction are also not considered indefinitely reinvested earnings. However, the company generally considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution) to be permanent in duration. The unrecognized tax liability is not practicable to determine. 91 | 2022 Form 10-K Unrecognized Tax Benefits years ended December 31 (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Beginning balance $ 5,489 $ 5,264 $ 2,661 Increase due to acquisition — — 2,674 Increase due to current year tax positions 88 208 91 Increase due to prior year tax positions 243 137 59 Decrease due to prior year tax positions ( 33 ) ( 62 ) ( 7 ) Settlements ( 7 ) ( 24 ) ( 141 ) Lapse of statutes of limitations ( 110 ) ( 34 ) ( 73 ) Ending balance $ 5,670 $ 5,489 $ 5,264 If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the company's effective tax rate is $ 5.5 billion in 2022 and $ 5.2 billion in 2021. The ""Increase due to current year tax positions"" and ""Increase due to prior year tax positions"" in the table above include amounts related to federal, state and international tax items. ""Increase due to acquisition"" in the table above includes amounts related to federal, state and international tax items recorded in acquisition accounting related to the Allergan acquisition. AbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie recognized gross income tax expense of $ 339 million in 2022, $ 161 million in 2021 and $ 142 million in 2020, for interest and penalties related to income tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross interest and penalties of $ 1.1 billion at December 31, 2022, $ 803 million at December 31, 2021 and $ 642 million at December 31, 2020. The company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible during the next 12 months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months up to $ 162 million. All significant federal, state, local and international matters have been concluded for years through 2009. The company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. Note 15 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. The most significant matters are described below. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. For litigation matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, beyond the amounts accrued. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Antitrust Litigation Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought 2022 Form 10-K | 92 by Niaspan direct purchasers and one brought by Niaspan end-payors. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2460. In August 2019, the court certified a class of direct purchasers of Niaspan. In June 2020 and August 2021, the court denied the end-payors' motion to certify a class. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al., against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2006 patent litigation settlements and related agreements by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) with three generic companies violated federal antitrust law, and also alleging that 2011 patent litigation by Abbott with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of those litigations violated federal antitrust law. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. In November 2022, the State of Oregon filed a lawsuit in the Multnomah County, Oregon Circuit Court making similar allegations regarding the 2011 patent litigation with one of the generic companies. Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC, an AbbVie subsidiary, and others generally alleging that 2009 and 2010 patent litigation settlements involving Namenda entered into between Forest and generic companies and other conduct by Forest involving Namenda, violated state antitrust, unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed by indirect purchasers of Namenda, are consolidated as In re: Namenda Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In November 2022, the parties reached an agreement to settle this matter that has received preliminary court approval. Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC and others generally alleging that 2012 and 2013 patent litigation settlements involving Bystolic with six generic manufacturers violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of Bystolic, are consolidated as In re: Bystolic Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Government Proceedings Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and several other manufacturers generally alleging that they improperly promoted and sold prescription opioid products. Approximately 3,000 matters are pending against Allergan. Most of the federal court cases are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the MDL rules as In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation, MDL No. 2804. Approximately 270 matters are pending in various state courts. The plaintiffs in these cases, which include states, counties, cities, other municipal entities, Native American tribes, union trust funds and other third-party payors, private hospitals and personal injury claimants, generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. In November 2022, Allergan finalized the terms of a settlement with state and local government entities and Native American tribes. That settlement is subject to certain conditions, including Allergan's determination that a sufficient number of government entities elect to participate in the settlement. AbbVie recorded a charge of $ 2.1 billion to selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in the second quarter of 2022 related to this potential settlement. Shareholder and Securities Litigation In June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., was filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in connection with its proposed transaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were filed between July 2017 and October 2019 against AbbVie and in some instances its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds. In September 2021, the Illinois court granted AbbVie's motion for summary judgment on all pending claims in all pending cases, dismissing them with prejudice. In November 2022, the Illinois appellate court affirmed summary judgment in AbbVie's favor and, in December 2022, that court denied plaintiffs' petition for rehearing. In October 2018, a federal securities lawsuit, Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2018 were misleading because they omitted alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira prescriptions. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a class. In May 2022, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, Ranney v. Gonzalez, et al., was filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that 93 | 2022 Form 10-K certain AbbVie directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties based on related allegations. In December 2022, after AbbVie and the director/officer defendants filed a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice. Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan's textured breast implants. The lawsuits, which were filed by Allergan shareholders, have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as In re: Allergan plc Securities Litigation. The plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees. In September 2019, the court partially granted Allergan's motion to dismiss. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a class. In December 2022, the court granted Allergan's motion for summary judgment on the remaining claims, dismissing them with prejudice. Plaintiffs are appealing the court's motion to dismiss and summary judgment rulings. In April 2022, a federal securities lawsuit, Nakata v. AbbVie Inc., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against AbbVie and certain officers alleging misstatements regarding the potential effect that safety information about another company’s product would have on the Food and Drug Administration’s approval and labeling for AbbVie’s Rinvoq. In May and July 2022, two shareholder derivative lawsuits, Treppel Family Trust v. Gonzalez et al., and Katcher v. Gonzalez, et al., were filed in the same court, alleging that certain AbbVie directors and officers breached fiduciary and other legal duties based on related allegations. Product Liability and General Litigation In 2018, a qui tam lawsuit, U.S. ex rel. Silbersher v. Allergan Inc., et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against several Allergan entities and others, alleging that their conduct before the U.S. Patent Office resulted in false claims for payment being made to federal and state healthcare payors for Namenda XR and Namzaric. The plaintiff-relator seeks damages and attorneys' fees under the federal False Claims Act and state law analogues. The federal government and state governments declined to intervene in the lawsuit. In August 2022, the United States Court of Appeals reversed the district court’s denial of Allergan’s motion to dismiss. The case has been remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with that ruling. Intellectual Property Litigation Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ibrutinib tablets (a drug Pharmacyclics sells under the trademark Imbruvica). Cases were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in March 2019 against Alvogen Pine Brook LLC and Natco Pharma Ltd. In August 2021, the court issued a decision holding all asserted patents infringed and valid. The judgment precludes Defendants from obtaining regulatory approval and launching until the last patent expires in 2036. On August 30, 2021, Defendants appealed. On November 15, 2022, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment. Janssen Biotech, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Pharmacyclics concerning the development and marketing of Imbruvica, is the co-plaintiff in these suits. AbbVie Inc. is seeking to enforce patent rights relating to venetoclax (a drug sold under the trademark Venclexta). Litigation was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in July 2020 against Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc.: and Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Alembic Global Holdings SA. AbbVie alleges defendants’ proposed generic venetoclax products infringe certain patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Genentech, Inc., which is in a global collaboration with AbbVie concerning the development and marketing of Venclexta, is the co-plaintiff in this suit. Note 16 Segment and Geographic Area Information AbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. 2022 Form 10-K | 94 Substantially all of AbbVie's net revenues in the United States are to three wholesalers. Outside the United States, products are sold primarily to health care providers or through distributors, depending on the market served.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 2022 Form 10-K | 98 Sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Revenue Recognition,” the Company established provisions for sales rebates in the same period the related product is sold. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 10,717 million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of which were for rebates provided to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to establish these sales rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based upon the identification of the products subject to a rebate, the applicable price and rebate terms and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment of the rebate. Auditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions included the estimated inventory in the distribution channel, which impacts the lag time between the sale to the customer and payment of the rebate, and the final payer related to product sales, which impacts the applicable price and rebate terms. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information to estimate product in the distribution channels, payer mix, prescription volumes and historical experience. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. The testing was inclusive of management’s controls to evaluate the accuracy of its reserve judgments to actual rebates paid, rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs, our audit procedures included, among others, understanding and evaluating the significant assumptions and underlying data used in management’s calculations. Our testing of significant assumptions included corroboration to external data sources. We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions considering industry and economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performed analytical procedures, based on internal and external data sources, to evaluate the completeness of the reserves. For Medicaid, we involved a specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company’s calculation methodologies with applicable government regulations and policy. 99 | 2022 Form 10-K Valuation of contingent consideration Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Business Combinations” and in Note 11 under the caption “Fair Value Measures,” the Company recognized contingent consideration liabilities at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date in connection with applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recorded within the consolidated statement of earnings in the period of change. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 16,384 million in contingent consideration liabilities, which represented a ‘Level 3’ fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value and the use of management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the liabilities. Auditing the valuation of contingent consideration liabilities was complex and required significant auditor judgment due to the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model and the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions required to estimate the fair value of contingent royalty payments. In particular, the fair value measurement was sensitive to the significant assumptions underlying the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Management utilized its expertise within the industry, including commercial dynamics, trends and utilization, as well as knowledge of clinical development and regulatory approval processes to determine certain of these assumptions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s contingent consideration liabilities process including, among others, management’s process to establish the significant assumptions and measure the liability. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the determination of fair value. The testing was inclusive of key management review controls to monitor and evaluate clinical development of the acquired products and estimated future sales, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the terms of the executed agreement, assessing the Monte Carlo simulation model used and testing the key contractual inputs and significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the assumptions and judgments considering observable industry and economic trends and standards, external data sources and regulatory factors. Estimated amounts of future sales were evaluated for reasonableness in relation to internal and external analyses, clinical development progress and timelines, probability of success benchmarks, and regulatory notices. Our procedures included evaluating the data sources used by management in determining its assumptions and, where necessary, included an evaluation of available information that either corroborated or contradicted management’s conclusions. We involved a valuation specialist to assess the Company’s Monte Carlo simulation model and to perform corroborative fair value calculations. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Scott T. Reents, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls. AbbVie's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie's disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Management of AbbVie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that AbbVie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Report of independent registered public accounting firm. The report of AbbVie's independent registered public accounting firm related to its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is included below. 101 | 2022 Form 10-K Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AbbVie Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 17, 2023 2022 Form 10-K | 102 ITEM 9B.

Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.

Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality, AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. In 2021, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 37% of AbbVie's 2021 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business. Competition The markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products, therapies 5 | 2021 Form 10-K and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products, JAK inhibitors and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available HCV treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded conventional (small-molecule) pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVie’s competitors could cause revenues for AbbVie’s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases. Biosimilars. Competition for AbbVie’s biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as “biosimilars.” Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for small molecule medications, and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products. Humira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, and AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products. In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FFDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the regulations implementing these statutes. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the PHSA, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is complex. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is ""highly similar"" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies. Furthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be ""interchangeable"" will be considered by the FDA as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its full ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty. Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity Generally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVie’s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a “patent term restoration,” for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration. Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a conventional drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Specific conditions of use approved for 2021 Form 10-K | 6 individual products may also be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law. Applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not generally be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods. Biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products. AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications. These patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2022 to the early 2040s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVie’s business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark Humira), are material in relation to the company’s business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in October 2018 in the majority of European Union countries. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. AbbVie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures. Under the agreements, the licenses in the United States will begin in 2023 and the licenses in Europe began in 2018. In addition, the following patents, licenses and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark Imbruvica) and those related to risankizumab (which is sold under the trademark Skyrizi). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027, however no generic entry for any ibrutinib product is expected prior to March 30, 2032, assuming pediatric exclusivity is granted. The United States composition of matter patent covering risankizumab is expected to expire in 2033. AbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVie’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVie’s employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 7 | 2021 Form 10-K Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements In addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-to-acquire agreements, licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements and joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5, ""Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements—Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Third Party Agreements AbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie seeks to maintain sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption. AbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5, ""Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements—Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Sources and Availability of Raw Materials AbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. Despite the disruption to the global supply chain caused by COVID-19, AbbVie has continued to supply patients with no material supply impact, except for the previously-disclosed near-term supply issues impacting Lupron. Given the general increased global volatility due to the pandemic, AbbVie is monitoring and taking actions to mitigate potential supply shortages which may impact the fulfillment of product demand. Research and Development Activities AbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds (and complementary devices) in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVie’s existing portfolio. AbbVie also supplements its research and development efforts with acquisitions. The research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases: • Phase 1— involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and doses for later phases. • Phase 2— tests different doses of the drug in a disease state in order to assess efficacy. • Phase 3— tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety in order to meet requirements to enable global approval. Preclinical data and clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar government agencies outside the United States. The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. 2021 Form 10-K | 8 The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication. In addition to the development of new products, delivery devices, and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug. Regulation—Discovery and Clinical Development United States. Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, announced or unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections associated with clinical development may include the sponsor, investigator sites, laboratories, hospitals and manufacturing facilities of AbbVie's subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, including rejection of an NDA or BLA. Even if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be submitted and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Further, the FDA continues to regulate product labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses along with other labeling restrictions. Outside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from applicable supervising regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target markets. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency. After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. In Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Japan-specific trials and/or bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application. Similarly, applications for a new product in China are submitted to the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration for technical review and approval of a product for marketing in China. Clinical data in Chinese subjects are usually required to support approval in China, requiring the inclusion of China in global pivotal studies, or a separate China/Asian clinical trial. 9 | 2021 Form 10-K The regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process. Similar to the requirements in Japan and China, certain countries (notably South Korea, Taiwan, India and Russia) also generally require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to support regulatory approval in the country. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans). Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing The manufacturing, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. In addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie's business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These studies can lead to updates to the data regarding utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight, investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. AbbVie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Political and budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie's products for the foreseeable future. United States. Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates may affect AbbVie's business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities. In the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In 2021 Form 10-K | 10 addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part D. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 70% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or ""donut hole."" The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. AbbVie expects debate to continue during 2022 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services. AbbVie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is difficult to predict the extent to which AbbVie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. European Union. The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products. Most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems. Japan. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available. Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Since AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action. 11 | 2021 Form 10-K Regulation – Medical Devices Medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA, state agencies and foreign government health authorities. FDA regulations, as well as various U.S. federal and state laws, govern the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping and marketing of medical device products agencies in the United States. AbbVie’s medical device product candidates, including AbbVie’s breast implants, must undergo rigorous clinical testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the United States and other countries. The lengthy process of clinical development and submissions for clearance or approval, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory clearance or approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope, and may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Cleared or approved products and their manufacturers are subject to ongoing review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale and/or use or require their withdrawal from the market. United States . AbbVie’s medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device AbbVie markets in the United States must have a 510(k) clearance or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) in accordance with the FFDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either Class I or Class II, and devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or a device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. In general, a Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA, and any changes to the device subsequent to initial FDA approval must also be reviewed and approved by the FDA. The majority of AbbVie’s medical device products, including AbbVie’s breast implants, are regulated as Class III medical devices. A Class III device may have significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval, and the time in which it takes to obtain approval can be long. Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, unannounced facility inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of AbbVie’s subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of AbbVie’ products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing AbbVie’ request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted; and criminal prosecution. A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (IDE), which must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A study sponsor must obtain approval for its IDE from the FDA, and it must also obtain approval of its study from the Institutional Review Board overseeing the trial. The results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain approval of the investigational device. Once a device is approved, the manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including Quality System Regulation requirements, which involve design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process. Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements. Manufacturers must also report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or if the manufacturer conducts a field correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a health risk. Further, the FDA continues to regulate device labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses along with other labeling restrictions. European Union. Medical device products that are marketed in the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (the MDR), which came into effect in May 2021. The MDR provides for regulatory oversight with respect to the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the European Union are safe and effective for their intended uses. Medical devices that comply with the MDR are entitled to bear a Conformité Européenne marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the European Union. Failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect AbbVie’s ability to market and sell AbbVie’s products in these countries. 2021 Form 10-K | 12 Environmental Matters AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. AbbVie's capital expenditures for pollution control in 2021 were approximately $17 million and operating expenditures were approximately $33 million. In 2022, capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately $14 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately $34 million. Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Some of these locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, and AbbVie has become a party to these investigations and remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which have been transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, AbbVie believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Employees AbbVie employed approximately 50,000 employees in over 70 countries as of January 31, 2022. Outside the United States, some of AbbVie's employees are represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees. Human Capital Management Attracting, retaining and providing meaningful growth and development opportunities to AbbVie's employees is critical to the company's success in making a remarkable impact on people’s lives around the world. AbbVie leverages numerous resources to identify and enhance strategic and leadership capability, foster employee engagement and create a culture where diverse talent is productive and engaged. AbbVie invests in its employees through competitive compensation, benefits and employee support programs and offers best-in-class development and leadership opportunities. AbbVie has developed a deep talent base through ongoing investment in functional and leadership training and by sourcing world-class external talent, ensuring a sustainable talent pipeline. AbbVie continuously cultivates and enhances its working culture and embraces equality, diversity and inclusion as fundamental to the company's mission. Attracting and Developing Talent. Attracting and developing high-performing talent is essential to AbbVie’s continued success. AbbVie implements detailed talent attraction strategies, with an emphasis on STEM skill sets, a diverse talent base and other critical skillsets, including drug discovery, clinical development, market access and business development. AbbVie also invests in competitive compensation and benefits programs. In addition to offering a comprehensive suite of benefits ranging from medical and dental coverage to retirement, disability and life insurance programs, AbbVie also provides health promotion programs, mental health awareness campaigns and employee assistance programs in several countries, financial wellness support, on-site health screenings and immunizations in several countries and on-site fitness and rehabilitation centers. In addition, the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund (a part of the AbbVie Foundation) supports two programs for global employees: the AbbVie Possibilities Scholarship for children of employees, which is an annual merit-based scholarship for use at accredited colleges, universities or vocational-technical schools; and the Employee Relief Program, which is financial assistance to support short term needs of employees when faced with large-scale disasters (e.g. a hurricane), individual disasters (e.g. a home fire) or financial hardship (e.g. the death of a spouse). Finally, AbbVie empowers managers and their teams with tools, tips and guidelines on effectively managing workloads, managing teams from a distance and supporting flexible work practices. New AbbVie employees are given a tailored onboarding experience for faster integration and to support performance. AbbVie's mentorship program allows employees to self-nominate as mentors or mentees and facilitates meaningful relationships supporting employees’ career and development goals. AbbVie also provides structured, broad-based development opportunities, focusing on high-performance skills and leadership training. AbbVie's talent philosophy holds leaders accountable for building a high-performing organization, and the company provides development opportunities to all levels of leadership. AbbVie's Learn, Develop, Perform program offers year-long, self-directed leadership education, supplemented with tools and resources, and leverages leaders as role models and teachers. In addition, the foundation to AbbVie's leadership pipeline is the company's Professional Development 13 | 2021 Form 10-K Programs, which attract graduates, postgraduates and post-doctoral talent to participate in formal development programs lasting up to three years, with the objective of strengthening functional and leadership capabilities. Culture. AbbVie’s shared values of transforming lives, acting with integrity, driving innovation, embracing diversity and inclusion and serving the community form the core of the company's culture. AbbVie articulates the behaviors associated with these values in the Ways We Work, a core set of working behaviors that emphasize how the company achieves results is equally as important as achieving them. The Ways We Work are designed to ensure that every AbbVie employee is aware of the company's cultural expectations. AbbVie integrates the Ways We Work into all talent processes, forming the basis for assessing performance, prioritizing development and ultimately rewarding employees. AbbVie believes its culture creates strong engagement, which is measured regularly through a confidential, third party all-employee survey, and this engagement supports AbbVie’s mission of making a remarkable impact on people’s lives. Equity, Equality, Diversity & Inclusion (EED&I). A cornerstone of AbbVie’s human capital management approach is to prioritize fostering an inclusive and diverse workforce. In 2019, AbbVie adopted a five-year Equality, Diversity & Inclusion roadmap that defines key global focus areas, objectives and associated initiatives, and includes implementation plans organized by business function and geography. AbbVie’s senior leaders have adopted formal goals aligned with executing this strategy. In recent years, AbbVie's board of directors has prioritized oversight of AbbVie's response to the U.S. racial justice movement, including overseeing internal programs designed to ensure that AbbVie is attracting, retaining and developing diverse talent. Through December 2021, women represented 51 percent of management positions globally and in the United States, 35 percent of AbbVie's workforce was comprised of members of historically underrepresented populations, an increase from 2020. Further, AbbVie is committed to pay equity and conducts pay equity analyses annually. A critical component of AbbVie's strategy is to instill an inclusive mindset in all AbbVie leaders and employees, so the company can realize the full value of a diverse workforce from recruitment through retirement. AbbVie recently launched a new resource for people who manage others to reinforce the importance of EED&I to the business, educate leaders on inclusive recruiting practices and modeling inclusive behavior, and encourage participation in the company's inclusive culture learning opportunities. AbbVie's Employee Resource Groups also help the company nurture an inclusive culture by building community, hosting awareness events and providing leadership and career opportunities. In 2021, AbbVie reiterated its commitment to racial equality and social justice by, among other things, expanding its employee matching program to $3-to-$1 for donations to civil rights nonprofits fostering racial equity and by reaffirming its commitment to clinical trial diversity. Additional information about AbbVie's efforts on racial equality and social justice is provided on the company's website at: https://abbvie.com/our-company/equality-inclusion-diversity/our-commitment-to-racial-justice.html. COVID-19 Health and Safety. AbbVie has effectively prioritized the health and safety of its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, while continuing to drive strong business performance. AbbVie implemented, among other things, temporary office and facility closures and establishment of new safety and cleaning protocols and procedures; regular communication regarding the effect of the pandemic on AbbVie's business and employees; establishment of physical distancing procedures, modification of workspaces and provision of personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies for employees; provision of on-site vaccinations and temperature screenings; a variety of testing and vaccination resources including on-site vaccinations and on-site and at-home testing and COVID case management programs; and remote working accommodations and related services to support employees’ needs for flexibility. In addition, COVID-19 is a covered event under the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund's Employee Relief Program, entitling eligible AbbVie employees and their families to financial assistance to pay for mortgage/rent, utilities, food, childcare and medical expenses not covered by insurance. AbbVie also provided paid leave and other support and accommodations to the company's employees with relevant medical, pharmaceutical, research and development, science, public health and public safety skills, knowledge, training and experience who desired or were requested or mandated to serve as volunteers during the pandemic. Lastly, AbbVie’s commitment to employees has been evidenced by no workforce reductions and no salary reductions associated with COVID-19 . Internet Information Copies of AbbVie's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through AbbVie's investor relations website ( investors.abbvie.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after AbbVie electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). AbbVie's corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of AbbVie's audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee and public policy committee are all available on AbbVie's investor relations website ( investors.abbvie.com ). 2021 Form 10-K | 14 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline. Risks Related to AbbVie's Business Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie’s operations and financial condition. Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie’s operations and financial condition. The continuing pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused many countries, including the United States, to declare national emergencies and implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lock-down orders, some of which have eased. The continuation or re-implementation of these bans and orders remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused AbbVie to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of AbbVie’s employees), and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVie’s employees, patients, customers and business partners. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie’s operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. The impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie over the long-term is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie’s operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to COVID-19 and the resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 may not completely prevent AbbVie's business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain. The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products. As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition. AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""Business—Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity"" and Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations,"" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings."" The United States composition of matter patent for Humira, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $20.7 billion in 2021, expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018. 15 | 2021 Form 10-K AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. Third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition. Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Any significant event that adversely affects Humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. Humira accounted for approximately 37% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2021. Any significant event that adversely affects Humira's revenues could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection for Humira (as described further in “— The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie’s future revenues and operating earnings ” above), the commercialization of biosimilars of Humira, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of Humira for any reason. AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, 2021 Form 10-K | 16 inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's future results of operations. Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer. A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products. AbbVie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics—including Humira—could adversely impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie's biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the United States and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved. In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with AbbVie’s biologic products, including Humira. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVie’s biologic products, AbbVie’s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of AbbVie’s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products. New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products 17 | 2021 Form 10-K and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available hepatitis C treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie’s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than AbbVie’s products, and this could negatively impact AbbVie’s business and results of operations. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers. The failure of these single-source suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve AbbVie's use of such alternatives. AbbVie does, however, carry business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier. Certain aspects of AbbVie’s operations are highly dependent upon third party service providers. AbbVie relies on suppliers, vendors and other third party service providers to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, promote and sell its products. Reliance on third party manufacturers reduces AbbVie’s oversight and control of the manufacturing process. Some of these third party providers are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, privacy and security risks and market risks of their own. The failure of a critical third party service provider to meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie’s operations and results. If any third party service providers have violated or are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations to AbbVie, it is possible that AbbVie could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences. Significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial condition. Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities and regulatory action could be 2021 Form 10-K | 18 taken by such regulatory authorities. Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of AbbVie's products. New data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's products. AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. For example, lawsuits are pending against Allergan, AbbVie’s recently acquired subsidiary, and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan’s textured breast implants. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product in question, lower income and exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. AbbVie is also the subject of other claims, legal proceedings and investigations in the ordinary course of business, which relate to the intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters. Adverse outcomes in such claims, legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect AbbVie’s business and results of operations. Additionally, Allergan has been named as a defendant in approximately 3,130 matters relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain relievers and additional suits may be filed. See Note 15, ""Legal Proceedings and Contingencies"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" AbbVie cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""Business—Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future. AbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and United States federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, contribute to pricing pressures. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures. In numerous major markets worldwide, the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings. Rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. 19 | 2021 Form 10-K AbbVie is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. AbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in Item 1, ""Business—Regulation—Discovery and Clinical Development,” “Business—Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing,” and “Business—Regulation—Medical Devices.” The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs. In addition, AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to AbbVie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls or seizures of AbbVie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of AbbVie's or its suppliers' facilities while AbbVie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt AbbVie's business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. The health care industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement, rebates, price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse. In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act, the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the TRICARE program, the government pricing rules applicable to the Medicaid, Medicare Part B, 340B Drug Pricing Program and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require AbbVie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt AbbVie's business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. AbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Net revenues outside of the United States made up approximately 23% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2021. The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States include: • fluctuations in currency exchange rates; • changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs; • multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its products; • differing local product preferences and product requirements; • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; • international trade disruptions or disputes; • difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations; • differing labor regulations; • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; 2021 Form 10-K | 20 • political and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union and the COVID-19 pandemic; • sovereign debt issues; • price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action and regulation; • inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates; • restrictions on transfers of funds; • potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries; and • potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and profitability. If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. AbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected. AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. AbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, joint ventures and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Additionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, joint ventures, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate. AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties. In 2021, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. 21 | 2021 Form 10-K AbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. The amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow AbbVie's business. In particular, AbbVie incurred significant debt in connection with its acquisition of Allergan. AbbVie’s substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt to equity ratio as a result of the acquisition may exacerbate these risks and have the effect of, among other things, reducing its flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and/or lowering its credit ratings. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase further. In addition, AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt. AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. AbbVie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes. For example, it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions. AbbVie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If AbbVie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, AbbVie may be unable to fund its expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect AbbVie's business. If AbbVie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may in the future result in the failure of critical business operations. Such breaches may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. To date, AbbVie’s business or operations have not been materially impacted by such incidents. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent material breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business. Such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from AbbVie’s or third-party providers’ databases or IT systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business harm to AbbVie and potentially substantial remediation costs. In connection with the acquisition of Allergan, AbbVie’s balances of intangible assets, including developed product rights and goodwill acquired, have increased significantly. Such balances are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges, which will adversely affect AbbVie’s results of operations and financial condition. A significant amount of AbbVie’s total assets is related to acquired intangibles and goodwill. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of AbbVie’s developed product rights and other intangible assets was $76.0 billion and the carrying value of AbbVie’s goodwill was $32.4 billion. AbbVie’s developed product rights are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. AbbVie determines original fair value and amortization periods for developed product rights based on its assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products. Significant adverse changes to any of these factors require AbbVie to perform an impairment test on the affected asset and, if evidence of impairment exists, require AbbVie to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset. For assets that are not impaired, AbbVie may adjust the remaining useful lives. Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s results of operations and financial condition. AbbVie’s other significant intangible assets include in-process research and development (IPR&D) intangible projects, acquired in recent business combinations, which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and AbbVie’s IPR&D intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or when events occur or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset. Impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying amount. A goodwill or IPR&D impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s results of operations and financial condition. 2021 Form 10-K | 22 Failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could affect AbbVie’s ability to successfully develop and commercialize products. AbbVie’s success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract, develop and retain diverse, highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical research and development (R&D), governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. AbbVie cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including: • changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, data privacy laws, particularly in the European Union and the United States, and environmental laws; • differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits, stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount; • changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts; • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts; • environmental liabilities in connection with AbbVie’s manufacturing processes and distribution logistics, including the handling of hazardous materials; • changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie; • business interruptions stemming from natural disasters, such as climate change, earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, fires, or efforts taken by third parties to prevent or mitigate such disasters; and • changes in business, economic and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups. Risks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock AbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock. Although AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5, ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future. An AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in the future. In the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits plans. 23 | 2021 Form 10-K In addition, AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes AbbVie to issue, without the approval of AbbVie's stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over AbbVie's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as AbbVie's board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. Certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading price of AbbVie's common stock. AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: • the inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting; • the division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term; • a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause; • the ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on AbbVie's board of directors; and • the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80% of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock. AbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 2021 Form 10-K | 24 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters.

This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview AbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 50,000 employees. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment. 2021 Financial Results AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2021 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $56.2 billion, operating earnings of $17.9 billion, diluted earnings per share of $6.45 and cash flows from operations of $22.8 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased by 23% on a reported basis and 22% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across its immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care portfolios as well as a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year. Diluted earnings per share in 2021 was $6.45 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $6.4 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $2.7 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (iii) $948 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); (iv) $500 million as a result of a collaboration agreement extension with Calico Life Sciences LLC; (v) $307 million for milestones and other research and development (R&D) expenses; (vi) $253 million for charges related to litigation matters; and (vii) $215 million of acquisition and integration expenses. These costs were partially offset by $265 million of certain tax benefits. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands. In October 2021, AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.41 per share of common stock payable in February 2022. This reflects an increase of approximately 8.5% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share of common stock. Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. The integration plan is expected to realize approximately $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022 . 2021 Form 10-K | 32 To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur total cumulative charges of approximately $2 billion through 2022. These costs consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses. Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) In response to the ongoing public health crisis posed by COVID-19, AbbVie continues to focus on ensuring the safety of employees. Throughout the pandemic, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from state and local health authorities and implemented safety measures for those employees who are returning to the workplace. AbbVie also continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie continues to experience lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and is dependent on numerous evolving factors, including the measures being taken by authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants and the availability and successful administration of effective vaccines. 2022 Strategic Objectives AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) growing revenues by leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) expanding operating margins; and (v) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months. AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through: • Immunology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as Humira U.S. sales growth. • Hematologic oncology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion of Venclexta, as well as maintaining the strong leadership position of Imbruvica. • Aesthetics revenue growth driven by global expansion and increasing market penetration of Botox and Juvederm Collection. • Neuroscience revenue growth driven by Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic, Ubrelvy and recently launched Qulipta. • Sustaining eye care leadership by maximizing AbbVie's current eye care portfolio. • The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2022. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7. AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued realization of expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition, leverage from revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. 33 | 2021 Form 10-K Research and Development Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline currently includes approximately 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. Of these programs, more than 50 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.

This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

include Allergan product revenues after the acquisition closing date of May 8, 2020. The following discussion and analysis of AbbVie's net revenues by product is presented on a constant currency basis. Global Humira sales increased 4% in 2021 primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, partially offset by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. In the United States, Humira sales increased 8% in 2021 driven by market growth across all indications. This increase was partially offset by slightly lower market share following corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 13% in 2021 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. Net revenues for Skyrizi increased 84% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 as a treatment for plaque psoriasis as well as market growth over the prior year. Net revenues for Rinvoq increased by more than 100% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis as well as market growth over the prior year. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Rinvoq for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis in certain international markets. 39 | 2021 Form 10-K Net revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues increased 2% in 2021 as a result of modest favorable pricing in the United States and increased collaboration revenues, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic and share loss in the United States. Net revenues for Venclexta increased 34% in 2021 primarily due to continued expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with first-line CLL, relapsed/refractory CLL and first-line AML. Net revenues for Botox Cosmetic used in facial aesthetics increased 98% in 2021 due to increased brand investment and strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year. Net revenues for Juvederm Collection (including Juvederm Ultra XC, Juvederm Voluma XC and other Juvederm products) used in facial aesthetics increased by more than 100% in 2021 due to increased brand investment and strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year. Net revenues for Botox Therapeutic used primarily in neuroscience and urology therapeutic areas increased 75% in 2021 due to a strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year. Net revenues for Vraylar for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression increased 82% in 2021 due to higher market share and market growth. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year. Net revenues for Ubrelvy for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults increased by more than 100% in 2021 primarily due to increased volume and market share uptake since launch in 2020. Net revenues for Mavyret decreased 8% in 2021 primarily driven by the continued disruption of global HCV markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross Margin Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 Gross margin $ 38,751 $ 30,417 $ 25,827 27 % 18 % as a percent of net revenues 69 % 66 % 78 % Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2021 increased from 2020 primarily due to lower amortization of inventory fair value step-up adjustment associated with the Allergan acquisition and favorable changes in product mix, partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the Allergan acquisition. Selling, General and Administrative Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 Selling, general and administrative $ 12,349 $ 11,299 $ 6,942 9 % 63 % as a percent of net revenues 22 % 25 % 21 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2021 decreased primarily due to lower transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Allergan as well as leverage from revenue growth and synergies realized in the period subsequent to completion of the Allergan acquisition. 2021 Form 10-K | 40 Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 Research and development $ 7,084 $ 6,557 $ 6,407 8 % 2 % as a percent of net revenues 13 % 14 % 19 % Acquired in-process research and development $ 962 $ 1,198 $ 385 (20) % >100% R&D expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2021 primarily due to the increased scale of the combined company and synergies realized for the period subsequent to completion of the Allergan acquisition as well as lower integration costs related to the acquisition of Allergan. Acquired IPR&D expenses represent initial costs to acquire rights to in-process R&D projects through R&D collaborations, licensing arrangements or other asset acquisitions. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2021 included a charge of $400 million as a result of exercising the company's exclusive right to acquire TeneoOne, an affiliate of Teneobio, Inc., and TNB-383B, a BCMA-targeting immunotherapeutic for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and a charge of $370 million as a result of entering into a collaboration agreement with REGENXBIO Inc. for the development and commercialization of RGX-314, an investigational gene therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and other chronic retinal diseases. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2020 included a charge of $750 million as a result of entering into a collaboration agreement with Genmab A/S to research, develop and commercialize investigational bispecific antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2020 also included a charge of $200 million as a result of entering into a collaboration agreement with I-Mab Biopharma for the development and commercialization of lemzoparlimab for the treatment of multiple cancers. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense in 2021 included a $500 million charge related to the extension of the Calico collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. Other Non-Operating Expenses years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Interest expense $ 2,423 $ 2,454 $ 1,784 Interest income (39) (174) (275) Interest expense, net $ 2,384 $ 2,280 $ 1,509 Net foreign exchange loss $ 51 $ 71 $ 42 Other expense, net 2,500 5,614 3,006 Interest expense in 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the company’s floating rate debt obligations and deleveraging, partially offset by a higher average debt balance associated with the incremental Allergan debt acquired. Interest income in 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the cash paid for the Allergan acquisition and the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates. Other expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities of $2.7 billion in 2021 and $5.8 billion in 2020. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. In 2021, the change in fair value included the increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated sales driven by stronger market share uptake, favorable clinical trial results and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2020, the change in fair value primarily included the increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated sales driven by stronger market share uptake, lower discount rates, the passage of time and favorable clinical trial results. 41 | 2021 Form 10-K Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 11% in 2021, negative 36% in 2020 and 6% in 2019. The effective income tax rates differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, tax audit settlements and accretion on contingent consideration. The 2020 effective income tax rate included the recognition of a net tax benefit of $1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Cash flows provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 22,777 $ 17,588 $ 13,324 Investing activities (2,344) (37,557) 596 Financing activities (19,039) (11,501) 18,708 Operating cash flows in 2021 increased from 2020. Operating cash flows in 2021 were favorably impacted by higher net revenues of the combined company and lower acquisition-related cash expenses, partially offset by higher income tax payments and the timing of working capital cash flows. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie’s contributions to its defined benefit plans of $376 million in 2021 and $367 million in 2020. Investing cash flows in 2021 included $535 million cash consideration paid to acquire Soliton, Inc. offset by cash acquired, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion, capital expenditures of $787 million and net purchases of investment securities totaling $21 million. Investing cash flows in 2020 included $39.7 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Allergan offset by cash acquired of $1.5 billion, net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $1.5 billion, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion and capital expenditures of $798 million. Financing cash flows in 2021 included early repayments of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.3% principal notes, $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 5.0% senior notes and €750 million aggregate principal amount of the company's 0.5% senior Euro notes. Financing cash flows also included the May 2021 repayment of $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes and the November 2021 repayment of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes, $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.15% senior notes and $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes at maturity. Additionally, financing cash flows included repayment of a $1.0 billion floating rate term loan due May 2023 and issuance of a new $1.0 billion floating rate term loan as part of the term loan refinancing in September 2021. Financing cash flows in 2020 included the issuance of term loans totaling $3.0 billion under the existing $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. Additionally, financing cash flows included the May 2020 repayment of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes, the September 2020 repayment of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes and the November 2020 repayments of €700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior Euro notes at maturity as well as the $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due February 2021. Financing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $9.3 billion in 2021 and $7.7 billion in 2020. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase of the dividend rate and higher outstanding shares following the 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders in May 2020. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 6 million shares for $670 million in 2021 and 8 million shares for $757 million in 2020. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2021. 2021 Form 10-K | 42 No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2021. In 2020, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. Credit Risk AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables. Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility AbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2021, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. Credit Ratings There were no changes to the company's credit ratings during 2021. Following the acquisition of Allergan in 2020, S&P Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. There were no changes in Moody's Investor Service of its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt. Future Cash Requirements Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021: (in millions) Total Current Long-term Long-term debt, including current portion $ 75,962 $ 12,428 $ 63,534 Interest on long-term debt (a) 30,002 2,392 27,610 Contingent consideration liabilities (b) 14,887 1,249 13,638 (a) Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2021. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2021. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2021. 43 | 2021 Form 10-K (b) Includes contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. AbbVie enters into certain unconditional purchase obligations and other commitments in the normal course of business. There have been no changes to these commitments that would have a material impact on the company’s ability to meet either short-term or long-term future cash requirements. Income Taxes Future income tax cash requirements include a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax liability was $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and is payable in five future annual installments. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled $6.0 billion as of December 31, 2021. It is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits. Quarterly Cash Dividend On October 29, 2021, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.30 per share to $1.41 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2022 to stockholders of record as of January 14, 2022. This reflects an increase of approximately 8.5% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. Collaborations, Licensing and Other Arrangements AbbVie enters into collaborative, licensing, and other arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. 2021 Form 10-K | 44 Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $33.9 billion in 2021, $27.0 billion in 2020 and $18.8 billion in 2019. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings. The following table is an analysis of the three largest accruals for rebates and chargebacks, which comprise approximately 95% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2021. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (in millions) Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Managed Care Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,645 $ 1,439 $ 656 Provisions 4,035 5,772 7,947 Payments (3,915) (5,275) (7,917) Balance at December 31, 2019 1,765 1,936 686 Additions (a) 1,266 649 71 Provisions 6,715 8,656 8,677 Payments (6,801) (8,334) (8,693) Balance at December 31, 2020 2,945 2,907 741 Provisions 9,622 11,306 11,286 Payments (8,751) (11,116) (11,125) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 3,816 $ 3,097 $ 902 (a) Represents rebate accruals and chargeback allowances assumed in the Allergan acquisition. Cash Discounts and Product Returns Cash discounts and product returns, which totaled $3.6 billion in 2021, $2.4 billion in 2020 and $1.6 billion in 2019, are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 | 2021 Form 10-K The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2021. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2022 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2021: 50 basis point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease Defined benefit plans Service and interest cost $ (90) $ 100 Projected benefit obligation (1,014) 1,159 Other post-employment plans Service and interest cost $ (7) $ 7 Projected benefit obligation (61) 69 The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2021 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2022. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2022 by $101 million. The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2021 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2022. Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between companies in 2021 Form 10-K | 46 the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Contingent Consideration The fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs, which are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on recent accounting pronouncements. 47 | 2021 Form 10-K ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020: 2021 2020 as of December 31 (in millions) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 10,253 1.155 $ 195 $ 7,818 1.213 $ (39) Chinese yuan 673 6.400 (1) 247 6.584 (1) British pound 605 1.331 9 275 1.341 3 Japanese yen 602 113.3 9 837 103.9 (7) Canadian dollar 571 1.258 9 591 1.328 (23) All other currencies 1,549 n/a 5 1,459 n/a (14) Total $ 14,253 $ 226 $ 11,227 $ (81) The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2021, the company has €5.9 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate Risk The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $244 million at December 31, 2021. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $5.0 billion at December 31, 2021. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. 2021 Form 10-K | 48 ITEM 8.

of these consolidated financial statements. 2021 Form 10-K | 54 AbbVie Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 Background Background The principal business of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of a broad line of therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100 % of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding this acquisition. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration liabilities, financial instruments and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less. Discounts, rebates, sales incentives to customers, returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are 55 | 2021 Form 10-K typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. Sales incentives to customers are insignificant. In addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography. Research and Development Expenses Internal research and development (R&D) costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development collaborations, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product. Collaborations and Other Arrangements The company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements during the development stage are expensed to acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of milestones during the development stage are expensed to R&D expense in the consolidated statements of earnings when the milestone is achieved. Milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $ 2.1 billion in 2021, $ 1.8 billion in 2020 and $ 1.1 billion in 2019. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are generally amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five-year period. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. 2021 Form 10-K | 56 Investments Investments consist primarily of equity securities, held-to-maturity debt securities, marketable debt securities and time deposits. Investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at cost. Gains or losses on investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until realized, at which time the gains or losses are recognized in earnings. AbbVie periodically assesses its marketable debt securities for impairment and credit losses. When a decline in fair value of marketable debt security is due to credit related factors, an allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. When AbbVie determines that a non-credit related impairment has occurred, the amortized cost basis of the investment, net of allowance for credit losses, is written down with a charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and an available-for-sale investment's unrealized loss is reclassified from AOCI to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any impairments and credit losses that were recorded in net earnings. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable and is determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, other currently available information including customer financial condition, and both current and forecasted economic conditions. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Cost includes material and conversion costs. Inventories consisted of the following: as of December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 Finished goods $ 932 $ 1,318 Work-in-process 1,193 1,201 Raw materials 1,003 791 Inventories $ 3,128 $ 3,310 Property and Equipment as of December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 Land $ 287 $ 288 Buildings 2,791 2,555 Equipment 6,850 6,976 Construction in progress 799 1,040 Property and equipment, gross 10,727 10,859 Less accumulated depreciation ( 5,617 ) ( 5,611 ) Property and equipment, net $ 5,110 $ 5,248 Depreciation for property and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life for buildings ranges from 10 to 50 years. Buildings include leasehold improvements which are amortized over the life of the related facility lease (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful life for equipment ranges from 2 to 25 years. Equipment includes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use and is amortized over 3 to 10 years. Depreciation expense was $ 803 million in 2021, $ 666 million in 2020 and $ 464 million in 2019. 57 | 2021 Form 10-K Leases Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. For leases commencing or modified in 2019 or later, AbbVie does not separate lease components from non-lease components. The company records lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. AbbVie generally uses an incremental borrowing rate to discount its lease liabilities, as the rate implicit in the lease is typically not readily determinable. Certain lease agreements include renewal options that are under the company's control. AbbVie includes optional renewal periods in the lease term only when it is reasonably certain that AbbVie will exercise its option. Variable lease payments include payments to lessors for taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs as well as payments that are adjusted based on an index or rate. The company's lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Litigation and Contingencies Loss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. Business Combinations AbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease 2021 Form 10-K | 58 the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Acquired In-Process Research and Development In an asset acquisition, the initial costs to acquire rights to IPR&D projects are expensed as IPR&D in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. In a business combination, the fair value of IPR&D projects acquired are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&D costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. For derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. The company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI. Derivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2019-12 In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) . The standard includes simplifications related to accounting for income taxes including removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 59 | 2021 Form 10-K Note 3 Supplemental Financial Information Interest Expense, Net years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Interest expense $ 2,423 $ 2,454 $ 1,784 Interest income ( 39 ) ( 174 ) ( 275 ) Interest expense, net $ 2,384 $ 2,280 $ 1,509 Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 Sales rebates $ 8,254 $ 7,188 Dividends payable 2,543 2,335 Accounts payable 2,882 2,276 Salaries, wages and commissions 1,785 1,669 Royalty and license arrangements 661 483 Other 6,574 6,208 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 22,699 $ 20,159 Other Long-Term Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 Contingent consideration liabilities $ 13,638 $ 12,289 Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 5,970 5,680 Income taxes payable 3,442 3,847 Pension and other post-employment benefits 3,153 3,413 Other 2,498 2,378 Other long-term liabilities $ 28,701 $ 27,607 2021 Form 10-K | 60 Note 4 Earnings Per Share AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive. The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method: Years ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 2019 Basic EPS Net earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 11,542 $ 4,616 $ 7,882 Earnings allocated to participating securities 74 60 40 Earnings available to common shareholders $ 11,468 $ 4,556 $ 7,842 Weighted average basic shares of common stock outstanding 1,770 1,667 1,481 Basic earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 6.48 $ 2.73 $ 5.30 Diluted EPS Net earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 11,542 $ 4,616 $ 7,882 Earnings allocated to participating securities 74 60 40 Earnings available to common shareholders $ 11,468 $ 4,556 $ 7,842 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 1,770 1,667 1,481 Effect of dilutive securities 7 6 3 Weighted average diluted shares of common stock outstanding 1,777 1,673 1,484 Diluted earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 6.45 $ 2.72 $ 5.28 Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented. Note 5 Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements Acquisition of Allergan On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its acquisition of all outstanding equity interests in Allergan in a cash and stock transaction. Allergan is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing branded pharmaceutical, device, biologic, surgical and regenerative medicine products for patients around the world. The combination created a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. Under the terms of the acquisition, each ordinary share of Allergan common stock was converted into the right to receive (i) $ 120.30 in cash and (ii) 0.8660 of a share of AbbVie common stock. Total consideration for the acquisition of Allergan is summarized as follows: (in millions) Cash consideration paid to Allergan shareholders (a) $ 39,675 Fair value of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders (b) 23,979 Fair value of AbbVie equity awards issued to Allergan equity award holders (c) 430 Total consideration $ 64,084 (a) Represents cash consideration transferred of $ 120.30 per outstanding Allergan ordinary share based on 330 million Allergan ordinary shares outstanding at closing. 61 | 2021 Form 10-K (b) Represents the acquisition date fair value of 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders based on the exchange ratio of 0.8660 AbbVie shares for each outstanding Allergan ordinary share at the May 8, 2020 closing price of $ 83.96 per share. (c) Represents the pre-acquisition service portion of the fair value of 11 million AbbVie stock options and 8 million RSUs issued to Allergan equity award holders. The acquisition of Allergan has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was finalized during the second quarter of 2021. Measurement period adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation during 2021 included (i) an increase to intangible assets of $ 710 million; (ii) an increase to deferred income tax liabilities of $ 148 million; (iii) other individually insignificant adjustments for a net increase to identifiable net assets of $ 2 million; and (iv) a corresponding decrease to goodwill of $ 564 million. The measurement period adjustments primarily resulted from the completion of the valuation of certain license agreement intangible assets based on facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and did not result from intervening events subsequent to such date. These adjustments did not have a significant impact on AbbVie's results of operations in 2021 and would not have had a significant impact on prior period results if these adjustments had been made as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes t he final fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date: (in millions) Assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and equivalents $ 1,537 Short-term investments 1,421 Accounts receivable 2,374 Inventories 2,340 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,982 Investments 137 Property and equipment 2,129 Intangible assets Definite-lived intangible assets 68,190 In-process research and development 1,600 Other noncurrent assets 1,395 Short-term borrowings ( 60 ) Current portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations ( 1,899 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 5,852 ) Long-term debt and finance lease obligations ( 18,937 ) Deferred income taxes ( 3,940 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 4,765 ) Total identifiable net assets 47,652 Goodwill 16,432 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 64,084 The fair value step-up adjustment to inventories of $ 1.2 billion was amortized to cost of products sold when the inventory was sold to customers and was fully amortized as of December 31, 2021. Intangible assets relate to $ 68.2 billion of definite-lived intangible assets and $ 1.6 billion of IPR&D. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets consist of developed product rights and license agreements and are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately twelve years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the ""income approach"" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors. 2021 Form 10-K | 62 The fair value of long-term debt was determined by quoted market prices as of the acquisition date and the total purchase price adjustment of $ 1.3 billion is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Allergan represents the value of additional growth platforms and an expanded revenue base as well as anticipated operational synergies and cost savings from the creation of a single combined global organization. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Following the acquisition date, the operating results of Allergan have been included in the consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2020, net revenues attributable to Allergan were $ 10.3 billion and operating losses attributable to Allergan were $ 1.1 billion, inclusive of $ 4.0 billion of intangible asset amortization and $ 1.2 billion of inventory fair value step-up amortization. Acquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $ 781 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $ 103 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 which were included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings . In the fourth quarter of 2021, AbbVie recovered certain acquisition-related regulatory fees totaling $ 401 million which was recorded as a reduction to SG&A expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021. Pro Forma Financial Information The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of AbbVie and Allergan for 2020 and 2019 as if the acquisition of Allergan had occurred on January 1, 2019: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Net revenues $ 50,521 $ 49,028 Net earnings (loss) 6,746 ( 38 ) The unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie and Allergan. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2019 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the final fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired; the incremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with acquisition date inventory; the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition; and the reclassification of acquisition-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2019. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition. Acquisition of Soliton, Inc. In December 2021, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of Soliton, Inc. (Soliton). Soliton's RESONIC (Rapid Acoustic Pulse device) has U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the long-term improvement in the appearance of cellulite up to one year. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Total consideration transferred allocated to the purchase price consisted of cash consideration of $ 535 million paid to holders of Soliton common stock, equity-based awards and warrants. As of the transaction date, AbbVie acquired $ 407 million of intangible assets for developed product rights and assumed deferred tax liabilities totaling $ 63 million. Other assets and liabilities were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 177 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition of Luminera In October 2020, AbbVie entered into an agreement with Luminera, a privately held aesthetics company based in Israel, to acquire Luminera's full dermal filler portfolio and R&D pipeline including HArmonyCa, a dermal filler intended for facial soft tissue augmentation. The aggregate accounting purchase price of $ 186 million was comprised of a $ 122 million upfront cash payment and $ 64 million for the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, for which AbbVie may owe up to $ 90 million in future payments upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. The agreement was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. As of the acquisition date, AbbVie acquired $ 127 million of intangible assets for in-process research and development and $ 33 million of intangible assets for developed 63 | 2021 Form 10-K product rights. Other assets and liabilities assumed were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 12 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity Cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $ 1.4 billion in 2021, $ 1.4 billion in 2020 and $ 1.1 billion in 2019. AbbVie recorded acquired IPR&D charges of $ 962 million in 2021, $ 1.2 billion in 2020 and $ 385 million in 2019. Significant arrangements impacting 2021, 2020 and 2019, some of which require contingent milestone payments, are summarized below.

Intangible Assets, Net The following table summarizes intangible assets: 2021 2020 as of December 31 (in millions) Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Definite-lived intangible assets Developed product rights $ 88,945 $ ( 18,463 ) $ 70,482 $ 87,707 $ ( 11,620 ) $ 76,087 License agreements 8,487 ( 3,688 ) 4,799 7,828 ( 2,916 ) 4,912 Total definite-lived intangible assets 97,432 ( 22,151 ) 75,281 95,535 ( 14,536 ) 80,999 Indefinite-lived research and development 670 — 670 1,877 — 1,877 Total intangible assets, net $ 98,102 $ ( 22,151 ) $ 75,951 $ 97,412 $ ( 14,536 ) $ 82,876 Definite-Lived Intangible Assets The increase in definite-lived intangible assets during 2021 was primarily due to the measurement period adjustments from the completion of the valuation of certain license agreements acquired in the Allergan acquisition as well as the acquisition of Soliton. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding these acquisitions and related adjustments. In 2021, AbbVie also reclassified $ 1.0 billion of indefinite-lived research and development intangible assets to developed product rights upon receiving certain regulatory approvals for Vuity, Qulipta, and HArmonyCa. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 1 to 16 years with an average of 12 years for developed product rights and 11 years for license agreements. Amortization expense was $ 7.7 billion in 2021, $ 5.8 billion in 2020 and $ 1.6 billion in 2019 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2021 is as follows: (in billions) 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Anticipated annual amortization expense $ 7.2 $ 7.5 $ 8.0 $ 8.4 $ 7.9 67 | 2021 Form 10-K Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPR&D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. Indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2021 primarily relate to the acquisition of Allergan. The company performs its annual impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. In 2019, following the announcement of the decision to terminate the rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) R&D program, the company recorded an impairment charge of $ 1.0 billion which represented the remaining value of the IPR&D acquired as part of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition. The impairment charge was recorded to R&D expense in the consolidated statements of earnings in 2019. Note 8 Integration and Restructuring Plans Allergan Integration Plan Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur total cumulative charges of approximately $ 2 billion of charges through 2022. These costs will consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses.

In connection with the acquisition of Allergan, in May 2020, the company borrowed $ 3.0 billion under a $ 6.0 billion term loan credit agreement, of which $ 1.0 billion was outstanding under a floating rate three-year term loan tranche and $ 2.0 billion outstanding under a floating rate five-year term loan tranche as of December 31, 2021. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. In May 2020, AbbVie completed its previously announced offers to exchange any and all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Allergan for new notes to be issued by AbbVie and cash. Following the settlement of the exchange offers, AbbVie issued $ 14.0 billion and € 3.1 billion of new notes in exchange for the Allergan notes tendered in the exchange offers. The aggregate principal amount of Allergan notes that remained outstanding following the settlement of the exchange offers was approximately $ 1.5 billion and € 635 million.

In November 2019, the company issued $ 30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the fixed-rate senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount or the sum of present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the fixed-rate senior notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium. With exception of the fixed-rate notes due 2021 and 2022, AbbVie may also redeem the fixed-rate senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $ 173 million and debt discounts totaled $ 52 million, which are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie used the net proceeds to fund a portion of the aggregate cash consideration due to Allergan shareholders in connection with the acquisition described in Note 5 and to pay related fees and expenses.

Short-Term Borrowings There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2021. The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings was 1.8 % in 2020 and 2.5 % in 2019. In August 2019, AbbVie entered into an amended and restated $ 4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants, all of which the company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2021. Commitment fees under AbbVie's revolving credit facilities were insignificant in 2021, 2020 and 2019. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facilities as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In March 2019, AbbVie repaid a $ 3.0 billion 364 -day term loan credit agreement that was drawn on in June 2018 and was scheduled to mature in June 2019. Maturities of Long-Term Debt The following table summarizes AbbVie's debt maturities as of December 31, 2021: as of and for the years ending December 31 (in millions) 2022 $ 12,428 2023 4,167 2024 7,219 2025 8,771 2026 6,000 Thereafter 37,377 Total obligations and commitments 75,962 Fair value hedges, unamortized bond premiums and discounts, deferred financing costs and finance lease obligations 708 Total long-term debt and finance lease obligations $ 76,670 Contingencies and Guarantees In connection with the separation, AbbVie has indemnified Abbott for all liabilities resulting from the operation of AbbVie's business other than income tax liabilities with respect to periods prior to the distribution date and other liabilities as agreed to by AbbVie and Abbott. AbbVie has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements and no special-purpose entities. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie has periodically entered into third-party agreements, such as the assignment of product rights, which have resulted in AbbVie becoming secondarily liable for obligations for which AbbVie had previously been primarily liable. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. Note 11 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Risk Management Policy The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. AbbVie's hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. AbbVie also periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the company's outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required. 2021 Form 10-K | 74 Financial Instruments Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $ 1.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 1.5 billion at December 31, 2020, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2021 will be reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement. In the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $ 10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in November 2019 resulting in a pre-tax gain of $ 383 million recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the term of the related debt. The company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designed as cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling $ 750 million at December 31, 2021 and $ 2.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and are reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt. The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $ 8.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 8.6 billion at December 31, 2020. The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of € 5.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and € 6.6 billion at December 31, 2020. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling € 4.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and € 971 million at December 31, 2020. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument. The company is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $ 4.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 4.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. 75 | 2021 Form 10-K The following table summarizes the amounts and location of AbbVie's derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets: Fair value - Derivatives in asset position Fair value - Derivatives in liability position as of December 31 (in millions) Balance sheet caption 2021 2020 Balance sheet caption 2021 2020 Foreign currency forward exchange contracts Designated as cash flow hedges Prepaid expenses and other $ 51 $ 2 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 2 $ 82 Designated as cash flow hedges Other assets — — Other long-term liabilities — 6 Designated as net investment hedges Prepaid expenses and other 149 — Accounts payable and accrued liabilities — 11 Designated as net investment hedges Other assets 15 — Other long-term liabilities — — Not designated as hedges Prepaid expenses and other 26 49 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 13 33 Interest rate swap contracts Designated as cash flow hedges Prepaid expenses and other — — Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 7 14 Designated as cash flow hedges Other assets — — Other long-term liabilities — 20 Designated as fair value hedges Prepaid expenses and other — 7 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities — — Designated as fair value hedges Other assets 26 131 Other long-term liabilities 15 — Total derivatives $ 267 $ 189 $ 37 $ 166 While certain derivatives are subject to netting arrangements with the company's counterparties, the company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets.

The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones 2021 Form 10-K | 78 and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs: 2021 2020 years ended December 31 (in millions) Range Weighted Average (a) Range Weighted Average (a) Discount rate 0.2 % - 2.6 % 1.7 % 0.1 % - 2.2 % 1.1 % Probability of payment for unachieved milestones 89 % - 100 % 90 % 56 % - 92 % 64 % Probability of payment for royalties by indication (b) 56 % - 100 % 96 % 56 % - 100 % 91 % Projected year of payments 2022 - 2034 2027 2021 - 2034 2027 (a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. (b) Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment ranged from 56 % to 89 % at December 31, 2021 and 56 % to 89 % at December 31, 2020. There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Beginning balance $ 12,997 $ 7,340 $ 4,483 Additions (a) — 225 — Change in fair value recognized in net earnings 2,679 5,753 3,091 Payments ( 789 ) ( 321 ) ( 234 ) Ending balance $ 14,887 $ 12,997 $ 7,340 (a) Additions during the year ended December 31, 2020 represent contingent consideration liabilities assumed in the Allergan acquisition as well as contingent consideration resulting from the Luminera acquisition (see Note 5). The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. During the year-ended December 31, 2021, the company recorded a $ 2.7 billion increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated sales driven by stronger market share uptake, favorable clinical trial results and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. During the year-ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded a $ 5.7 billion increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated future sales driven by stronger market share uptake, lower discount rates, the passage of time and favorable clinical trial results. During the second quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 2.3 billion increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales and lower discount rates. The higher probabilities of success resulted from the April 2019 regulatory approvals of Skyrizi for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. During the third quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 91 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T R&D program. 79 | 2021 Form 10-K Certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

The company records these investments at cost and remeasures them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $ 149 million as of December 31, 2021 and $ 102 million as of December 31, 2020. No significant cumulative upward or downward adjustments have been recorded for these investments as of December 31, 2021. Concentrations of Risk Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 75 % as of December 31, 2021 and 72 % as of December 31, 2020, and substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product net revenues in the United States were to these three wholesalers. Humira (adalimumab) is AbbVie's single largest product and accounted for approximately 37 % of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2021, 43 % in 2020 and 58 % in 2019. 2021 Form 10-K | 80 Note 12 Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie sponsors various pension and other post-employment benefit plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. In addition, AbbVie provides medical benefits, primarily to eligible retirees in the United States and Puerto Rico, through other post-retirement benefit plans. Net obligations for these plans have been reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

The 2020 actuarial losses of $ 1.1 billion for qualified pension plans and $ 40 million for other post-employment plans were primarily driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate from 2019. AbbVie's U.S. pension plan was modified to close the plan to new entrants effective January 1, 2022. In addition, a change to AbbVie's U.S. retiree health benefit plan was approved in 2020 and communicated to employees and retirees in October 2020. Beginning in 2022, Medicare-eligible retirees and Medicare-eligible dependents will choose health care coverage from insurance providers through a private Medicare exchange. AbbVie will continue to provide financial support to Medicare-eligible retirees. This change to the U.S. retiree health benefit plan decreased AbbVie's post-employment benefit obligation and increased AbbVie's unrecognized prior service credit as of December 31, 2020 by $ 397 million. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie assumed certain post-employment benefit obligations which were recorded at fair value. Upon acquisition in the second quarter of 2020, the excess of projected benefit obligations over the plan assets was recognized as a liability totaling $ 156 million. 2021 Form 10-K | 82 Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The following table summarizes the pre-tax losses (gains) included in other comprehensive income (loss): years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Defined benefit plans Actuarial loss (gain) $ ( 345 ) $ 701 $ 1,231 Amortization of prior service cost ( 2 ) ( 2 ) — Amortization of actuarial loss ( 288 ) ( 227 ) ( 109 ) Foreign exchange loss (gain) and other ( 27 ) 56 ( 6 ) Total loss (gain) $ ( 662 ) $ 528 $ 1,116 Other post-employment plans Actuarial loss $ 10 $ 40 $ 451 Prior service credit — ( 397 ) — Amortization of prior service credit 39 4 — Amortization of actuarial loss ( 32 ) ( 26 ) ( 1 ) Total loss (gain) $ 17 $ ( 379 ) $ 450 Net Periodic Benefit Cost years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Defined benefit plans Service cost $ 440 $ 370 $ 269 Interest cost 237 264 259 Expected return on plan assets ( 663 ) ( 575 ) ( 474 ) Amortization of prior service cost 2 2 — Amortization of actuarial loss 288 227 109 Net periodic benefit cost $ 304 $ 288 $ 163 Other post-employment plans Service cost $ 48 $ 42 $ 25 Interest cost 19 34 29 Amortization of prior service credit ( 39 ) ( 4 ) — Amortization of actuarial loss 32 26 1 Net periodic benefit cost $ 60 $ 98 $ 55 The components of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.

The pre-65 rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 % ( 1.8 % post-65) in 2029 and remain at that level thereafter. For purposes of measuring the 2021 post-retirement health care costs, the company assumed a 6.0 % pre-65 ( 2.3 % post-65) annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The pre-65 rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 % ( 2.0 % post-65) for 2029 and remain at that level thereafter. 2021 Form 10-K | 84 Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions) 2021 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities U.S. large cap (a) $ 1,428 $ 1,428 $ — $ — U.S. mid cap (b) 198 198 — — International (c) 458 458 — — Fixed income securities U.S. government securities (d) 228 95 133 — Corporate debt instruments (d) 945 179 766 — Non-U.S. government securities (d) 602 445 157 — Other (d) 273 268 5 — Absolute return funds (e) 100 5 95 — Real assets 10 10 — — Other (f) 261 216 45 — Total $ 4,503 $ 3,302 $ 1,201 $ — Total assets measured at NAV 6,152 Fair value of plan assets $ 10,655 Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions) 2020 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities U.S. large cap (a) $ 1,143 $ 1,143 $ — $ — U.S. mid cap (b) 164 164 — — International (c) 524 524 — — Fixed income securities U.S. government securities (d) 132 18 114 — Corporate debt instruments (d) 854 178 676 — Non-U.S. government securities (d) 544 397 147 — Other (d) 297 294 3 — Absolute return funds (e) 310 4 306 — Real assets 10 10 — — Other (f) 252 250 2 — Total $ 4,230 $ 2,982 $ 1,248 $ — Total assets measured at NAV 5,472 Fair value of plan assets $ 9,702 (a) A mix of index funds and actively managed equity accounts that are benchmarked to various large cap indices.

(f) Investments in cash and cash equivalents. Equities and registered investment companies having quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are quoted at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. Investments held in pooled investment funds, common collective trusts or limited partnerships are valued at the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is provided by the fund administrator and is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are established for each plan and are generally made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The 2021 target investment allocation for the AbbVie Pension Plan was 62.5 % in equity securities, 22.5 % in fixed income securities and 15 % in asset allocation strategies and other holdings. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets of the AbbVie Pension Plan or of any other plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption for each plan is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. Expected Benefit Payments The following table summarizes total benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants including payments funded from both plan and company assets: years ending December 31 (in millions) Defined benefit plans Other post-employment plans 2022 $ 293 $ 27 2023 312 30 2024 334 31 2025 356 34 2026 379 36 2027 to 2031 2,291 224 Defined Contribution Plan AbbVie maintains defined contribution savings plans for the benefit of its eligible employees. The expense recognized for these plans was $ 267 million in 2021, $ 191 million in 2020 and $ 102 million in 2019. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees. Note 13 Equity Stock-Based Compensation In May 2021, stockholders of the company approved the AbbVie Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Program (the Amended Plan), which amends and restates the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP). AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the Amended Plan, which provides for several different forms of benefits, including non-qualified stock options, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the Amended Plan, a total of 144 million shares of AbbVie common stock have been reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees. The 2013 ISP also facilitated the assumption of certain awards granted under Abbott’s incentive stock program, which were adjusted and converted into Abbott and AbbVie stock-based awards as a result of AbbVie's separation from Abbott. 2021 Form 10-K | 86 AbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least 10 years of service. Stock-based compensation expense is principally related to awards issued pursuant to the 2013 ISP and the Amended Plan and is summarized as follows: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Cost of products sold $ 46 $ 47 $ 29 Research and development 226 247 171 Selling, general and administrative 420 459 230 Pre-tax compensation expense 692 753 430 Tax benefit 126 131 80 After-tax compensation expense $ 566 $ 622 $ 350 Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $ 50 million in 2021, $ 34 million in 2020 and $ 15 million in 2019. Stock Options Stock options awarded to employees typically have a contractual term of 10 years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period. The exercise price is equal to at least 100 % of the market value on the date of grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted were $ 16.28 in 2021, $ 12.14 in 2020 and $ 12.54 in 2019. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, during the second quarter of 2020, AbbVie issued 11.2 million stock options to holders of Allergan options as a result of the conversion of such options. These options were fair-valued using a lattice valuation model. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the Allergan acquisition. The following table summarizes AbbVie stock option activity in 2021: (options in thousands, aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Options Weighted- average exercise price Weighted-average remaining life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value Outstanding at December 31, 2020 15,691 $ 73.90 4.7 $ 559 Granted 1,147 105.94 Exercised ( 4,278 ) 57.77 Lapsed and forfeited ( 186 ) 105.28 Outstanding at December 31, 2021 12,374 $ 81.98 4.7 $ 661 Exercisable at December 31, 2021 9,424 $ 78.03 3.6 $ 541 The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 239 million in 2021, $ 186 million in 2020 and $ 22 million in 2019. The total fair value of options vested during 2021 was $ 21 million. As of December 31, 2021, $ 10 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . RSUs and Performance Shares RSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees generally vest in ratable increments over a three or four-year period. Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period. The majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and other key employees are performance-based. Equity awards granted to senior executives and other key employees consist of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares as well as non-qualified stock options described above. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a three-year performance period. For awards granted in 2021 and 2020, performance is based on AbbVie's return on invested capital relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life science companies. For awards granted in 2019, the tranches tied to 2021 performance are based on AbbVie’s return on 87 | 2021 Form 10-K equity relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. The recipient may receive one share of AbbVie common stock for each vested award. The performance shares have the potential to vest over a three-year performance period and may be earned based on AbbVie’s EPS achievement and AbbVie’s total stockholder return (TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-vested RSUs and performance shares accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs and performance shares generally is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the quoted price of AbbVie’s common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table summarizes AbbVie RSU and performance share activity for 2021: (share units in thousands) Share units Weighted-average grant date fair value Outstanding at December 31, 2020 15,918 $ 87.03 Granted 7,556 105.79 Vested ( 6,735 ) 91.63 Forfeited ( 1,849 ) 83.35 Outstanding at December 31, 2021 14,890 $ 94.93 The fair market value of RSUs and performance shares (as applicable) vested was $ 718 million in 2021, $ 618 million in 2020 and $ 371 million in 2019. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, during the second quarter of 2020, AbbVie issued 8.2 million RSUs to holders of Allergan equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the Allergan acquisition. As of December 31, 2021, $ 592 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs and performance shares is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . Cash Dividends Cash dividends declared per common share totaled $ 5.31 in 2021, $ 4.84 in 2020 and $ 4.39 in 2019.

The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased under these programs are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses and are available for general corporate purposes. AbbVie repurchased 6 million shares for $ 670 million in 2021, 8 million shares for $ 757 million in 2020 and 4 million shares for $ 300 million in 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $ 2.5 billion as of December 31, 2021. 2021 Form 10-K | 88 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table summarizes the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for 2021, 2020 and 2019: (in millions) (brackets denote losses) Foreign currency translation adjustments Net investment hedging activities Pension and post-employment benefits Marketable security activities Cash flow hedging activities Total Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ ( 830 ) $ ( 65 ) $ ( 1,722 ) $ ( 10 ) $ 147 $ ( 2,480 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 98 ) 95 ( 1,330 ) 12 298 ( 1,023 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — ( 21 ) 87 ( 2 ) ( 157 ) ( 93 ) Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 98 ) 74 ( 1,243 ) 10 141 ( 1,116 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 ( 928 ) 9 ( 2,965 ) — 288 ( 3,596 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 1,511 ( 785 ) ( 300 ) — ( 108 ) 318 Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — ( 14 ) 198 — ( 23 ) 161 Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) 1,511 ( 799 ) ( 102 ) — ( 131 ) 479 Balance as of December 31, 2020 583 ( 790 ) ( 3,067 ) — 157 ( 3,117 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 1,153 ) 720 298 — 76 ( 59 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — ( 21 ) 223 — 75 277 Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 1,153 ) 699 521 — 151 218 Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ ( 570 ) $ ( 91 ) $ ( 2,546 ) $ — $ 308 $ ( 2,899 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) for 2021 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling losses of $ 1.2 billion and the offsetting impact of net investment hedging activities totaling gains of $ 699 million, which were principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive income (loss) for 2020 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling gains of $ 1.5 billion and the offsetting impact of net investment hedging activities totaling losses of $ 799 million, which were principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the Euro on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive income (loss) for 2019 included pension and post-employment benefit plan losses of $ 1.2 billion primarily due to an actuarial loss driven by lower discount rates. See Note 12 for additional information. 89 | 2021 Form 10-K The table below presents the impact on AbbVie's consolidated statements of earnings for significant amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss: years ended December 31 (in millions) (brackets denote gains) 2021 2020 2019 Net investment hedging activities Gains on derivative amount excluded from effectiveness testing (a) $ ( 26 ) $ ( 18 ) $ ( 27 ) Tax expense 5 4 6 Total reclassifications, net of tax $ ( 21 ) $ ( 14 ) $ ( 21 ) Pension and post-employment benefits Amortization of actuarial losses and other (b) $ 283 $ 251 $ 110 Tax benefit ( 60 ) ( 53 ) ( 23 ) Total reclassifications, net of tax $ 223 $ 198 $ 87 Cash flow hedging activities Losses (gains) on foreign currency forward exchange contracts (c) $ 87 $ ( 23 ) $ ( 167 ) Gains on treasury rate lock agreements (a) ( 24 ) ( 24 ) ( 3 ) Losses (gains) on interest rate swap contracts (a) 24 17 ( 1 ) Tax expense (benefit) ( 12 ) 7 14 Total reclassifications, net of tax $ 75 $ ( 23 ) $ ( 157 ) (a) Amounts are included in interest expense, net (see Note 11).

The effective income tax rates in 2021, 2020 and 2019 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, tax audit settlements and accretion on contingent consideration. The 2020 effective income tax rate included the recognition of a net tax benefit of $ 1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. The effective income tax rate in 2020 and 2019 included impacts related to U.S. tax reform. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was signed into law in December 2017, resulting in significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, including a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously untaxed. The Act also created a minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The company’s accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings is to report the tax effects on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense. The effective income tax rates for 2019 also included the effects of Stemcentrx impairment related expenses. 91 | 2021 Form 10-K Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets Compensation and employee benefits $ 937 $ 1,109 Accruals and reserves 667 438 Chargebacks and rebates 837 555 Advance payments 809 324 Net operating losses and other credit carryforwards 10,095 2,765 Other 1,234 1,371 Total deferred tax assets 14,579 6,562 Valuation allowances ( 9,391 ) ( 1,203 ) Total net deferred tax assets 5,188 5,359 Deferred tax liabilities Excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets ( 4,711 ) ( 5,274 ) Excess of book basis over tax basis in investments ( 308 ) ( 335 ) Other ( 904 ) ( 982 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 5,923 ) ( 6,591 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 735 ) $ ( 1,232 ) The decrease in net deferred tax assets is primarily related to the utilization of net operating losses and other carryforwards offset by an increase in advance payments. The decrease in deferred tax liabilities is primarily related to amortization of intangible assets. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, the company recorded adjustments within the measurement period in 2021 related to foreign net operating losses and other credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The adjustments reflected an increase of $ 8.2 billion to deferred tax assets and an offsetting increase to valuation allowances, resulting in no net impact to deferred tax assets. The company had valuation allowances of $ 9.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $ 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. These were principally related to foreign and state net operating losses and other credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. As of December 31, 2021, the company had U.S. federal and state credit carryforwards of $ 214 million as well as U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 34.4 billion, which will expire at various times through 2041. The remaining U.S. federal and foreign loss carryforwards of $ 3.2 billion have no expiration. The Act significantly changed the timing and manner in which earnings of foreign subsidiaries are subject to U.S. tax. Therefore, unremitted foreign earnings subject to the Act’s transition tax are not considered indefinitely reinvested. Post-2017 earnings subject to the U.S. minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings or eligible for the 100 percent foreign dividends received deduction are also not considered indefinitely reinvested earnings. However, the company generally considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution) to be permanent in duration. The unrecognized tax liability is not practicable to determine. 2021 Form 10-K | 92 Unrecognized Tax Benefits years ended December 31 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Beginning balance $ 5,264 $ 2,661 $ 2,852 Increase due to acquisition — 2,674 — Increase due to current year tax positions 208 91 113 Increase due to prior year tax positions 137 59 499 Decrease due to prior year tax positions ( 62 ) ( 7 ) ( 21 ) Settlements ( 24 ) ( 141 ) ( 749 ) Lapse of statutes of limitations ( 34 ) ( 73 ) ( 33 ) Ending balance $ 5,489 $ 5,264 $ 2,661 If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the company's effective tax rate is $ 5.2 billion in 2021 and $ 5.0 billion in 2020. Of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the table above as of December 31, 2021, AbbVie would be indemnified for approximately $ 79 million. The ""Increase due to current year tax positions"" and ""Increase due to prior year tax positions"" in the table above include amounts related to federal, state and international tax items. ""Increase due to acquisition"" in the table above includes amounts related to federal, state and international tax items recorded in acquisition accounting related to the Allergan acquisition. AbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie recognized gross income tax expense of $ 161 million in 2021, $ 142 million in 2020 and $ 51 million in 2019, for interest and penalties related to income tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross interest and penalties of $ 803 million at December 31, 2021, $ 642 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 191 million at December 31, 2019. The company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible during the next 12 months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months up to $ 225 million. All significant federal, state, local and international matters have been concluded for years through 2008. The company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. Note 15 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. The most significant matters are described below. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. For litigation matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, beyond the amounts accrued. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Antitrust Litigation Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits 93 | 2021 Form 10-K pending in federal court consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by Niaspan direct purchasers and one brought by Niaspan end-payors. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2460. In August 2019, the court certified a class of direct purchasers of Niaspan. In June 2020 and August 2021, the court denied the end-payors' motion to certify a class. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2006 patent litigation settlements and related agreements by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) with three generic companies violated federal antitrust law, and also alleging that 2011 patent litigation by Abbott with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of those litigations violated federal antitrust law. In May 2020, Perrigo Company and related entities filed a lawsuit against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that Abbott's 2011 AndroGel patent lawsuit filed against Perrigo was sham litigation. In October 2020, the Perrigo lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for New Jersey. In September 2021, the New Jersey court granted AbbVie's motion for judgment on the pleadings in the Perrigo lawsuit, dismissing it with prejudice. Perrigo has appealed the dismissal. Between March and May 2019, 12 putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by indirect Humira purchasers, alleging that AbbVie’s settlements with biosimilar manufacturers and AbbVie’s Humira patent portfolio violated state and federal antitrust laws. The court consolidated these lawsuits as In re: Humira (Adalimumab) Antitrust Litigation . In June 2020, the court dismissed the consolidated litigation with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal. Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC and others generally alleging that 2009 and 2010 patent litigation settlements involving Namenda entered into between Forest and generic companies and other conduct by Forest involving Namenda, violated state antitrust, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed by indirect purchasers of Namenda, are consolidated as In re: Namenda Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Lawsuits are pending against Allergan Inc. generally alleging that Allergan’s petitioning to the U.S. Patent Office and Food and Drug Administration and other conduct by Allergan involving Restasis violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, certified as a class action filed on behalf of indirect purchasers of Restasis, are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the MDL Rules as In re: Restasis (Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion) Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2819. In May 2021, the parties reached an agreement to settle this matter that is subject to final court approval. Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC and others generally alleging that 2012 and 2013 patent litigation settlements involving Bystolic with six generic manufacturers violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of Bystolic, are consolidated as In re: Bystolic Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Government Proceedings Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and several other manufacturers generally alleging that they improperly promoted and sold prescription opioid products. Approximately 3,130 matters are pending against Allergan. The federal court cases are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the MDL rules as In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation , MDL No. 2804. Approximately 251 of the claims are pending in various state courts. The plaintiffs in these cases, which include states, counties, cities, other municipal entities, Native American tribes, union trust funds and other third-party payors, private hospitals, and personal injury claimants, generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. In December 2021, a California state court reached a judgment for Allergan and other defendants in the trial of an opioid lawsuit by Orange, Los Angeles, and Santa Clara Counties and the City of Oakland. In December 2021, Allergan reached an agreement to settle a lawsuit brought by the State of New York and two New York counties, which also provides all other New York counties and political subdivisions the opportunity to participate in the settlement. 2021 Form 10-K | 94 In July 2019, the New Mexico Attorney General filed a lawsuit, State of New Mexico ex rel. Balderas v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , in New Mexico District Court for Santa Fe County against AbbVie and other companies alleging their marketing of AndroGel violated New Mexico’s Unfair Practices Act. In October 2020, the state added a claim under the New Mexico False Advertising Act. Shareholder and Securities Litigation In June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc. , was filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in connection with its proposed transaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were filed between July 2017 and October 2019 against AbbVie and in some instances its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds. The court granted motions dismissing the claims of three investment-fund plaintiffs, which they appealed. In March 2021, in the first of those appeals, the dismissal was affirmed. One of these plaintiffs refiled its lawsuit in New York state court in June 2020 while the appeal of its dismissal in Illinois is pending. In November 2020, the New York Supreme Court for the County of New York dismissed that lawsuit, which is being appealed. In September 2021, the Illinois court granted AbbVie's motion for summary judgment against all remaining plaintiffs on all the remaining claims, dismissing them with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissals. In October 2018, a federal securities lawsuit, Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al ., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2017 were misleading because they omitted alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira prescriptions. In September 2021, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a class. Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan's textured breast implants.

In July 2021, the parties reached an agreement to settle the class action lawsuits, which received court approval in November 2021. Product Liability and General Litigation In 2018, a qui tam lawsuit, U.S. ex rel. Silbersher v. Allergan Inc., et al. , was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against several Allergan entities and others, alleging that their conduct before the U.S. Patent Office resulted in false claims for payment being made to federal and state healthcare payors for Namenda XR and Namzaric. The plaintiff-relator seeks damages and attorneys' fees under the federal False Claims Act and state law analogues. The federal government and state governments declined to intervene in the lawsuit. Intellectual Property Litigation AbbVie Inc. and AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd are seeking to enforce their patent rights relating to adalimumab (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark Humira). In April 2021 and May 2021, cases were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Alvotech hf. AbbVie alleges defendant’s proposed biosimilar adalimumab product infringes certain AbbVie patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. In August 2021, the court denied Defendant’s motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds in the first case; a motion in the second case remains pending. The court has set a trial on a subset of patents for August 2022. The court order provides that Alvotech will stay off the market until that decision. Litigation on the remaining patents is stayed. In October 2021, the May 2021 declaratory judgment action filed by Alvotech hf. and its U.S. subsidiary Alvotech USA, Inc. in the United States Eastern District of Virginia was transferred to the Northern District of Illinois and subsequently dismissed. Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ibrutinib tablets (a drug Pharmacyclics sells under the trademark Imbruvica). Cases were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in March 2019 against Alvogen Pine Brook LLC and Natco Pharma Ltd.. In August 2021, the court issued a decision holding all asserted patents infringed and valid. The judgment precludes Defendants from obtaining regulatory approval and launching until the last patent expires in 2036. Janssen Biotech, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Pharmacyclics concerning the development and marketing of Imbruvica, is the co-plaintiff in these suits. 95 | 2021 Form 10-K Allergan USA, Inc., Allergan Sales, LLC, and Forest Laboratories Holdings Limited, wholly owned subsidiaries of AbbVie, are seeking to enforce patent rights relating to cariprazine (a drug sold under the trademark Vraylar). Litigation was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in December 2019 against Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and Sun Pharma Global FZE; Aurobindo Pharma Limited and Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc.; and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA), Inc. and Cadila Healthcare Limited. Allergan alleges defendants' proposed generic cariprazine products infringe certain patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Gedeon Richter Plc, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Allergan concerning the development and marketing of Vraylar, is the co-plaintiff in this suit. 2021 Form 10-K | 96 Note 16 Segment and Geographic Area Information AbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 2021 Form 10-K | 100 Sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Revenue Recognition,” the Company established provisions for sales rebates in the same period the related product is sold. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $ 8,254 million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of which were for rebates provided to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to establish these sales rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based upon the identification of the products subject to a rebate, the applicable price and rebate terms and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment of the rebate. Auditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions included the estimated inventory in the distribution channel, which impacts the lag time between the sale to the customer and payment of the rebate, and the final payer related to product sales, which impacts the applicable price and rebate terms. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information to estimate product in the distribution channels, payer mix, prescription volumes and historical experience. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. The testing was inclusive of management’s controls to evaluate the accuracy of its reserve judgments to actual rebates paid, rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare, and managed care programs, our audit procedures included, among others, understanding and evaluating the significant assumptions and underlying data used in management’s calculations. Our testing of significant assumptions included corroboration to external data sources. We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions considering industry and economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performed analytical procedures, based on internal and external data sources, to evaluate the completeness of the reserves. For Medicaid, we involved a specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company’s calculation methodologies with applicable government regulations and policy. 101 | 2021 Form 10-K Valuation of contingent consideration Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Business Combinations” and in Note 11 under the caption “Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures,” the Company recognized contingent consideration liabilities at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date in connection with applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recorded within the consolidated statement of earnings in the period of change. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $ 14,887 million in contingent consideration liabilities, which represented a ‘Level 3’ fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value and the use of management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the liabilities. Auditing the valuation of contingent consideration liabilities was complex and required significant auditor judgment due to the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model and the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions required to estimate the fair value of contingent royalty payments. In particular, the fair value measurement was sensitive to the significant assumptions underlying the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Management utilized its expertise within the industry, including commercial dynamics, trends and utilization, as well as knowledge of clinical development and regulatory approval processes to determine certain of these assumptions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s contingent consideration liabilities process including, among others, management’s process to establish the significant assumptions and measure the liability. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the determination of fair value. The testing was inclusive of key management review controls to monitor and evaluate clinical development of the acquired products and estimated future sales, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the terms of the executed agreement, assessing the Monte Carlo simulation model used and testing the key contractual inputs and significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the assumptions and judgments considering observable industry and economic trends and standards, external data sources and regulatory factors. Estimated amounts of future sales were evaluated for reasonableness in relation to internal and external analyses, clinical development progress and timelines, probability of success benchmarks, and regulatory notices. Our procedures included evaluating the data sources used by management in determining its assumptions and, where necessary, included an evaluation of available information that either corroborated or contradicted management’s conclusions. We involved a valuation specialist to assess the Company’s Monte Carlo simulation model and to perform corroborative fair value calculations. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. Chicago, Illinois February 18, 2022 2021 Form 10-K | 102 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Robert A. Michael, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2021. Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls. AbbVie's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie's disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Management of AbbVie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that AbbVie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. Report of independent registered public accounting firm.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated February 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 18, 2022 2021 Form 10-K | 104 ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS Overview AbbVie (1) is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). The acquisition of Allergan creates a diversified biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions in key therapeutic areas of immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. See Note 5, ""Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements—Acquisition of Allergan,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Allergan. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. In response to the growing public health crisis, AbbVie has partnered with global authorities to support the experimental use of multiple AbbVie assets to determine their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower new patient starts across the therapeutic portfolio. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the outbreak. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain. Segments AbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. See Note 16, ""Segment and Geographic Area Information"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and the sales information related to AbbVie's key products and geographies included under Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the terms ""AbbVie"" or ""the company"" refer to AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation, or AbbVie Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. 1 | 2020 Form 10-K Products AbbVie's portfolio of products includes a broad line of therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases.

AbbVie's commercial rights to the sale and distribution of Synagis outside of the United States will revert to AstraZeneca upon the expiry of the current agreement in 2021. Marketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities AbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and distribute its products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand of products by physicians, key opinion leaders and other health care providers. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie also markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States many of the company's products must be sold pursuant to a prescription. Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its promotional and market access efforts on key opinion leaders, payers, physicians and health systems. AbbVie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic AbbVie has maintained its promotional activities with key stakeholders by leveraging digital engagement where permitted and in compliance with the locally applicable government guidance. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality, AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors. 5 | 2020 Form 10-K In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies and patients. In 2020, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States. No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 38% of AbbVie's 2020 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business. Competition The markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products, therapies and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available HCV treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVie’s competitors could cause revenues for AbbVie’s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases. Biosimilars. Competition for AbbVie’s biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as “biosimilars.” Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional (small molecule) medications, and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products. Humira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, and AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products. In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FFDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the regulations implementing such acts. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the PHSA, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is complex. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is ""highly similar"" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies. Furthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be ""interchangeable"" will be considered by the FDA as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty. Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity Generally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVie’s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, 2020 Form 10-K | 6 the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a “patent term restoration,” for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration. Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length, and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional 5 years of marketing exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law. Applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods. Biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products. AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications. These patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2021 to the late 2030s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVie’s business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark Humira), are material in relation to the company’s business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in October 2018 in the majority of European Union countries. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. AbbVie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures. Under the agreements, the license in the United States will begin in 2023 and the license in Europe began in 2018. 7 | 2020 Form 10-K In addition, the following patents, licenses, and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark Imbruvica) and those related to risankizumab (which is sold under the trademark Skyrizi). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027. The United States composition of matter patent covering risankizumab is expected to expire in 2033. AbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVie’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVie’s employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements In addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-to-acquire agreements, licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, and joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs, and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5, ""Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements—Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Third Party Agreements AbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption. AbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5, ""Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements—Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" Sources and Availability of Raw Materials AbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. Other than the Lupron near-term supply issue which has impacted availability of certain formulations, AbbVie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages that impacted fulfillment of product demand. Research and Development Activities AbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVie’s existing portfolio. AbbVie also supplements its research and development efforts with acquisitions. 2020 Form 10-K | 8 The research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases: • Phase 1—involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and potential dosing. • Phase 2—tests the drug's efficacy against the disease in a relatively small group of patients. • Phase 3—tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria. The clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar government agencies outside the United States. The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication. In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug. Regulation—Discovery and Clinical Development United States. Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Even if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be submitted and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Further, the FDA continues to regulate product labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses along with other labeling restrictions. 9 | 2020 Form 10-K Outside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from applicable supervising regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target markets. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. In Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Japan-specific trials and/or bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application. Similarly, applications for a new product in China are submitted to the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for technical review and approval of a product for marketing in China. Clinical data in Chinese subjects are required to support approval in China, requiring the inclusion of China in global pivotal studies, or a separate China/Asian clinical trial. The regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process. Similar to the requirements in Japan and China, certain countries (notably South Korea, Taiwan and Russia) also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to support regulatory approval in the country. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans). Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing The manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. In addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie's business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These studies can lead to updates to the data regarding utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. 2020 Form 10-K | 10 Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight, investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. AbbVie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Political and budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie's products for the foreseeable future. United States. Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect AbbVie's business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities. In the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part D. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 50% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or ""donut hole."" The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. AbbVie expects debate to continue during 2021 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services. AbbVie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which AbbVie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. European Union. The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products. 11 | 2020 Form 10-K Most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems. Japan. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available. Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Since AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action. Regulation – Medical Devices Medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA, state agencies and foreign government health authorities. FDA regulations, as well as various U.S. federal and state laws, govern the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping and marketing of medical device products agencies in the United States. AbbVie’s medical device product candidates, including AbbVie’s breast implants, must undergo rigorous clinical testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the United States and other countries. The lengthy process of clinical development and submissions for clearance or approval, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory clearance or approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope, and may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Cleared or approved products and their manufacturers are subject to ongoing review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale, and/or use or require their withdrawal from the market. United States . AbbVie’s medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device AbbVie markets in the United States must have a 510(k) clearance or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) in accordance with the FFDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either Class I or Class II, and devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or a device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. In general, a Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA, and any changes to the device subsequent to initial FDA approval must also be reviewed and approved by the FDA. The majority of AbbVie’s medical device products, including AbbVie’s breast implants, are regulated as Class III medical devices. A Class III device may have significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval, and the time in which it takes to obtain approval can be long. Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, unannounced facility inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of AbbVie’s subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of AbbVie’ products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing AbbVie’ request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted; and criminal prosecution. A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (IDE), which must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A study sponsor must obtain approval for its IDE from the FDA, and it must also obtain approval of its study from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) overseeing the trial. The results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain approval of the investigational device. 2020 Form 10-K | 12 Once a device is approved, the manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including Quality System Regulation requirements, which involve design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process. Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements. Manufacturers must also report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or if the manufacturer conducts a field correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a health risk. Further, the FDA continues to regulate device labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses along with other labeling restrictions. European Union. Medical device products that are marketed in the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (the MDR), which will come into effect in May 2021. The MDR provides for regulatory oversight with respect to the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the European Union are safe and effective for their intended uses. Medical devices that comply with the MDR are entitled to bear a Conformité Européenne marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the European Union. Failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect AbbVie’s ability to market and sell AbbVie’s products in these countries. Environmental Matters AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. AbbVie's capital expenditures for pollution control in 2020 were approximately $6 million and operating expenditures were approximately $34 million. In 2021, capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately $9 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately $36 million. Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Some of these locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, and AbbVie has become a party to these investigations and remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which have been transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, AbbVie believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Employees AbbVie employed approximately 47,000 employees in over 70 countries as of January 31, 2021. Outside the United States, some of AbbVie's employees are represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees. Human Capital Management Attracting, retaining and providing meaningful growth and development opportunities to AbbVie's employees is critical to the company's success in making a remarkable impact on people’s lives around the world. AbbVie leverages numerous resources to identify and enhance strategic and leadership capability, foster employee engagement and create a culture where diverse talent is productive and engaged. AbbVie invests in its employees through competitive compensation, benefits and employee support programs and offers best-in-class development and leadership opportunities. AbbVie has developed a deep talent base through ongoing investment in functional and leadership training and by sourcing world-class external talent, ensuring a sustainable talent pipeline. AbbVie continuously cultivates and enhances its working culture and embraces equality, diversity and inclusion as fundamental to the company's mission. 13 | 2020 Form 10-K Attracting and Developing Talent. Attracting and developing high-performing talent is essential to AbbVie’s continued success. AbbVie implements detailed talent attraction strategies, with an emphasis on STEM skill sets, a diverse talent base and other critical skillsets, including drug discovery, clinical development, market access, and business development. AbbVie also invests in competitive compensation and benefits programs. In addition to offering a comprehensive suite of benefits ranging from medical and dental coverage to retirement, disability and life insurance programs, AbbVie also provides health promotion programs, mental health awareness campaigns and employee assistance programs in several countries, financial wellness support, on-site health screenings and immunizations in several countries and on-site fitness and rehabilitation centers. In addition, the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund (a part of the AbbVie Foundation) supports two programs for global employees: the AbbVie Possibilities Scholarship for children of employees, which is an annual merit-based scholarship for use at accredited colleges, universities or vocational-technical schools; and the Employee Relief Program, which is financial assistance to support short term needs of employees when faced with large-scale disasters (e.g. a hurricane), individual disasters (e.g. a home fire) or financial hardship (e.g. the death of a spouse). Finally, AbbVie empowers managers and their teams with tools, tips and guidelines on effectively managing workloads, managing teams from a distance and supporting flexible work practices. New AbbVie employees are given a tailored onboarding experience for faster integration and to support performance. AbbVie's mentorship program allows employees to self-nominate as mentors or mentees and facilitates meaningful relationships supporting employees’ career and development goals. AbbVie also provides structured, broad-based development opportunities, focusing on high-performance skills and leadership training. AbbVie's talent philosophy holds leaders accountable for building a high-performing organization, and the company provides development opportunities to all levels of leadership. AbbVie's Learn, Develop, Perform program offers year-long, self-directed leadership education, supplemented with tools and resources, and leverages leaders as role models and teachers. In addition, the foundation to AbbVie's leadership pipeline is the company's Professional Development Programs, which attract graduates, postgraduates and post-doctoral talent to participate in formal development programs lasting up to three years, with the objective of strengthening functional and leadership capabilities. AbbVie also recently introduced additional development support to senior leaders who are managing increased integration and operational complexity following the transformational acquisition of Allergan. Culture. AbbVie’s shared values of transforming lives, acting with integrity, driving innovation, embracing diversity and inclusion, and serving the community form the core of the company's culture. AbbVie articulates the behaviors associated with these values in the Ways We Work, a core set of working behaviors that emphasize how the company achieves results is equally as important as achieving them. The Ways We Work are designed to ensure that every AbbVie employee is aware of the company's cultural expectations. AbbVie integrates the Ways We Work into all talent processes, forming the basis for assessing performance, prioritizing development, and ultimately rewarding employees. AbbVie believes it culture creates strong engagement, which is measured regularly through a confidential, third party all-employee survey, and this engagement supports AbbVie’s mission of making a remarkable impact on people’s lives. Equity, Equality, Diversity & Inclusion (EED&I). A cornerstone of AbbVie’s human capital management approach is to prioritize fostering an inclusive and diverse workforce. In 2019, AbbVie adopted a five-year Equality, Diversity & Inclusion roadmap that defines key global focus areas, objectives and associated initiatives, and includes implementation plans organized by business function and geography. AbbVie’s senior leaders have adopted formal goals aligned with executing this strategy. Over the past year, AbbVie's board of directors has prioritized oversight of AbbVie's response to the U.S. racial justice movement, including overseeing internal programs designed to ensure that AbbVie is attracting, retaining and developing diverse talent. Through June 2020, women represented 49 percent of management positions globally and in the United States, 33 percent of AbbVie's workforce was comprised of members of historically underrepresented populations, an increase from 2019. Further, AbbVie is committed to pay equity and conducts pay equity analyses annually. A critical component of AbbVie's strategy is to instill an inclusive mindset in all AbbVie leaders and employees, so the company can realize the full value of a diverse workforce from recruitment through retirement. AbbVie recently launched a new toolkit for people who manage others to reinforce the importance of EED&I to the business, educate leaders on inclusive recruiting practices and modeling inclusive behavior, and encourage participation in the company's inclusive culture learning opportunities. AbbVie's Employee Resource Groups also help the company nurture an inclusive culture by building community, hosting awareness events and providing leadership and career opportunities. In 2020, AbbVie reiterated its commitment to racial equality and social justice by appointing two additional senior level positions to drive change and awareness company-wide and taking deliberate steps to ensure AbbVie leads by example in promoting racial equity, as further described on the company's website at: https://www.abbvie.com/our-company/our-principles/our-commitment-to-racial-justice.html. 2020 Form 10-K | 14 COVID-19 Health and Safety. AbbVie has effectively prioritized the health and safety of its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, while continuing to drive strong business performance. AbbVie also implemented, among other things, temporary office and facility closures and establishment of new safety and cleaning protocols and procedures; regular communication regarding the effect of the pandemic on AbbVie's business and employees; establishment of physical distancing procedures, modification of workspaces, and provision of personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies for employees; temperature screening at all company locations; a variety of testing resources including on-site and at-home testing and COVID case management programs; and remote working accommodations and related services to support employees’ needs for flexibility. In addition, COVID-19 is a covered event under the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund's Employee Relief Program, entitling eligible AbbVie employees and their families to financial assistance to pay for mortgage/rent, utilities, food, childcare and medical expenses not covered by insurance. AbbVie also provided paid leave and other support and accommodations to the company's employees with relevant medical, pharmaceutical, R&D, science, public health and public safety skills, knowledge, training and experience who desired or were requested or mandated to serve as volunteers during the pandemic. Lastly, AbbVie’s commitment to employees was evidenced by no workforce reductions and no salary reductions associated with COVID-19 . Internet Information Copies of AbbVie's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after AbbVie electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). AbbVie's corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of AbbVie's audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee and public policy committee are all available on AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ). ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline. Risks Related to AbbVie's Business Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie’s operations and financial condition. Public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie’s operations and financial condition. The continuing pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused many countries, including the United States, to declare national emergencies and implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lock-down orders, some of which have eased. The continuation or re-implementation of these bans and orders remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused AbbVie to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of AbbVie’s employees), and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVie’s employees, patients, customers and business partners. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie’s operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to-date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower 15 | 2020 Form 10-K new patient starts across the therapeutic portfolio. The impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie over the long-term is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie’s operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to COVID-19 and the resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, the outbreak could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie’s operations and financial condition. The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products. As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition. AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""Business—Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity"" and Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations,"" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings."" The United States composition of matter patent for Humira, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $19.8 billion in 2020, expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018. AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. Third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition. Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful 2020 Form 10-K | 16 claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Any significant event that adversely affects Humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. Humira accounted for approximately 43% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2020. Any significant event that adversely affects Humira's revenues could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection for Humira (as described further in “— The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie’s future revenues and operating earnings ” above), the commercialization of biosimilars of Humira, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of Humira for any reason. AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's future results of operations. Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer. A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products. AbbVie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. 17 | 2020 Form 10-K Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics—including Humira—could adversely impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie's biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the United States and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved. In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with AbbVie’s biologic products, including Humira. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVie’s biologic products, AbbVie’s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of AbbVie’s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products. New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available hepatitis C treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie’s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than AbbVie’s products, and this could negatively impact AbbVie’s business and results of operations. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. 2020 Form 10-K | 18 AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers. The failure of these single-source suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve AbbVie's use of such alternatives. AbbVie does, however, carry business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier. Certain aspects of AbbVie’s operations are highly dependent upon third party service providers. AbbVie relies on suppliers, vendors and other third party service providers to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, promote and sell its products. Reliance on third party manufacturers reduces AbbVie’s oversight and control of the manufacturing process. Some of these third party providers are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, privacy and security risks and market risks of their own. The failure of a critical third party service provider to meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie’s operations and results. If any third party service providers have violated or are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations to AbbVie, it is possible that AbbVie could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences. Significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial condition. Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities and regulatory action could be taken by such regulatory authorities. Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of AbbVie's products. New data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's products. AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. For example, lawsuits are pending against Allergan, AbbVie’s newly acquired subsidiary, and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan’s textured breast implants. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product in question, lower income and exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. AbbVie is also the subject of other claims, legal proceedings and investigations in the ordinary course of business, which relate to the intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters. Adverse outcomes in such claims, legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect AbbVie’s business and results of operations. Additionally, Allergan has been named as a defendant in approximately 3,100 matters relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain 19 | 2020 Form 10-K relievers and additional suits may be filed. See Note 15, ""Legal Proceedings and Contingencies"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" AbbVie cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""Business—Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future. AbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and United States federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, contribute to pricing pressures. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures. In numerous major markets worldwide, the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings. Rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. AbbVie is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. AbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in Item 1, ""Business—Regulation—Discovery and Clinical Development,” “Business—Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing,” and “Business—Regulation—Medical Devices.” The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs. In addition, AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to AbbVie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls or seizures of AbbVie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of AbbVie's or its suppliers' facilities while AbbVie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt AbbVie's business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. 2020 Form 10-K | 20 Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. The health care industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement, rebates, price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse. In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act, the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the TRICARE program, the government pricing rules applicable to the Medicaid, Medicare Part B, 340B Drug Pricing Program and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require AbbVie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt AbbVie's business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. AbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Net revenues outside of the United States made up approximately 24% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2020. The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States include: • fluctuations in currency exchange rates; • changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs; • multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its products; • differing local product preferences and product requirements; • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; • international trade disruptions or disputes; • difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations; • differing labor regulations; • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; • political and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union and the COVID-19 pandemic; • sovereign debt issues; • price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action and regulation; • inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates; • restrictions on transfers of funds; • potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries, including in Europe and Latin America; and • potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and profitability. 21 | 2020 Form 10-K If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. AbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected. AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. AbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, joint ventures and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Additionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, joint ventures, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate. AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties. In 2020, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States. If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. The amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow AbbVie's business. In particular, AbbVie incurred significant debt in connection with its acquisition of Allergan. AbbVie’s substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt to equity ratio as a result of the acquisition may exacerbate these risks and have the effect of, among other things, reducing its flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and/or lowering its credit ratings. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase further. In addition, AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt. AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. AbbVie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes. For example, it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions. AbbVie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If AbbVie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, AbbVie may be unable to fund its expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect AbbVie's business. If AbbVie 2020 Form 10-K | 22 raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others have resulted, and may in the future result, in the failure of critical business operations or may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. To date, AbbVie’s business or operations have not been materially impacted by such incidents. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent material breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business. Such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from AbbVie’s or third-party providers’ databases or IT systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business harm to AbbVie and potentially substantial remediation costs. In connection with the acquisition of Allergan, AbbVie’s balances of intangible assets, including developed product rights and goodwill acquired, have increased significantly. Such balances are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges, which will adversely affect AbbVie’s results of operations and financial condition. A significant amount of AbbVie’s total assets is related to acquired intangibles and goodwill. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of AbbVie’s developed product rights and other intangible assets was $82.9 billion and the carrying value of AbbVie’s goodwill was $33.1 billion. AbbVie’s developed product rights are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. AbbVie determines original fair value and amortization periods for developed product rights based on its assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products. Significant adverse changes to any of these factors require AbbVie to perform an impairment test on the affected asset and, if evidence of impairment exists, require AbbVie to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset. For assets that are not impaired, AbbVie may adjust the remaining useful lives. Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s results of operations and financial condition. AbbVie’s other significant intangible assets include in-process research and development (IPR&D) intangible projects, acquired in recent business combinations, which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and AbbVie’s IPR&D intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or when events occur or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset. Impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying amount. A goodwill or IPR&D impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s results of operations and financial condition. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could affect AbbVie’s ability to successfully develop and commercialize products. AbbVie’s success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical research and development (R&D), governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. AbbVie cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including: • changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, data privacy laws, particularly in the European Union and the United States, and environmental laws; • differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits, stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount; 23 | 2020 Form 10-K • changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts; • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts; • environmental liabilities in connection with AbbVie’s manufacturing processes and distribution logistics, including the handling of hazardous materials; • changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie; and • changes in business, economic and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups. Risks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock AbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock. Although AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5, ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future. An AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in the future. In the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits plans. In addition, AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes AbbVie to issue, without the approval of AbbVie's stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over AbbVie's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as AbbVie's board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. Certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading price of AbbVie's common stock. AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: • the inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting; • the division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term; 2020 Form 10-K | 24 • a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause; • the ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on AbbVie's board of directors; and • the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80% of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock. AbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 25 | 2020 Form 10-K CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters.

This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."" This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed the acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). The acquisition of Allergan creates a diversified biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions in key therapeutic areas of immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, AbbVie's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of Allergan. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 47,000 employees. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment. 2020 Financial Results AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2020 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $45.8 billion, operating earnings of $11.4 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.72 and cash flows from operations of $17.6 billion. Worldwide net revenues increased by 38% on a reported basis and on a constant currency basis, which included $10.3 billion of contributed revenues from the Allergan acquisition, growth in the immunology portfolio from Skyrizi, Rinvoq and the continued strength of Humira in the U.S. as well as revenue growth from Imbruvica and Venclexta. Diluted earnings per share in 2020 was $2.72 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $5.7 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (ii) $4.8 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (iii) $3.0 billion of Allergan acquisition and integration expenses; (iv) $1.2 billion for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); and $241 million for milestones and other research and development (R&D) expenses. These costs were partially offset by $1.7 billion of certain tax benefits. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands. In October 2020, AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.30 per share of common stock payable in February 2021. This reflects an increase of approximately 10.2% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.18 per share of common stock. Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. The integration plan is expected to realize more than $2 billion of expected annual cost synergies over a three-year period, with approximately 50% realized in R&D, 40% in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and 10% in cost of products sold. 2020 Form 10-K | 32 To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur approximately $2 billion of charges through 2022. These costs will consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses. Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world. In response to the growing public health crisis, AbbVie has partnered with global authorities to support the experimental use of multiple AbbVie assets to determine their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. In June 2020, AbbVie announced that it entered into a collaboration with Harbour BioMed, Utrecht University and Erasmus Medical Center to develop a novel antibody therapeutic to prevent and treat COVID-19. Additionally, AbbVie donated $35 million to increase healthcare capacity, supply critical equipment and deliver food and essential supplies during the crisis. AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower new patient starts across the therapeutic portfolio. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the outbreak. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain. 2021 Strategic Objectives AbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition to create a more diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) growing revenues by leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across Allergan's therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) expanding operating margins; and (v) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months. AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through: • Immunology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and expanding patient access of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as Humira U.S. sales growth. • Hematologic oncology revenue growth from both Imbruvica and Venclexta. • Expansion of the company’s revenue base from additional Allergan products contributing to key aesthetics and neuroscience portfolios. • Effective management of Humira international biosimilar erosion. • Optimization of combined AbbVie and Allergan research and development, commercial, and manufacturing operations while maintaining key growth portfolios. • The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2021. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7. AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, realization of expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. The combination of AbbVie and Allergan creates a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, women's health, eye care and virology. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. 33 | 2020 Form 10-K Research and Development Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline currently includes more than 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis. Of these programs, more than 50 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months. Significant Programs and Developments Immunology Skyrizi • In January 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 KEEPsAKE-1 and KEEPsAKE-2 clinical trials of Skyrizi in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) met the primary and ranked secondary endpoints. • In January 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 ADVANCE and MOTIVATE induction studies of Skyrizi in patients with Crohn’s Disease met the primary and key secondary endpoints.

The CRL indicated that the rate of intraocular inflammation observed following administration of abicipar pegol results in an unfavorable benefit-risk ratio in the treatment of nAMD. In July 2020, AbbVie withdrew the regulatory application with the EMA for abicipar pegol for the treatment of nAMD. Women's Health Oriahnn • In May 2020, the FDA approved Oriahnn (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules) for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Revenues The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

The following discussion and analysis of AbbVie's net revenues by product is presented on a constant currency basis. Global Humira sales increased 4% in 2020 primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, offset by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. In the United States, Humira sales increased 8% in 2020 driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 12% in 2020 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. Biosimilar competition for Humira is not expected in the United States until 2023. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies intended to maintain market leadership among its installed patient base and add to the sustainability of Humira. Net revenues for Skyrizi increased more than 100% in 2020 primarily driven by market growth and market share gains over the prior year following the April 2019 regulatory approvals for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Net revenues for Rinvoq increased more than 100% in 2020 primarily driven by the August 2019 FDA approval and December 2019 EC approval for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. 2020 Form 10-K | 38 Net revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues increased 14% in 2020 as a result of continued penetration of Imbruvica for patients with CLL, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Net revenues for Venclexta increased 69% in 2020 primarily due to continued expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with first-line CLL, relapsed/refractory CLL and first-line AML. Net revenues for Botox Cosmetic used in facial aesthetics were $1.1 billion in 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition. Net revenues for Juvederm Collection (including Juvederm Ultra XC, Juvederm Voluma XC and other Juvederm products) used in facial aesthetics were $718 million in 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition. Net revenues for Botox Therapeutic used primarily in neuroscience and urology therapeutic areas were $1.4 billion in 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition. Net revenues for Vraylar for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression were $951 million in 2020 for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition. Global Mavyret sales decreased 37% in 2020 primarily driven by lower global new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as competitive dynamics in the U.S. Net revenues for Creon increased 7% in 2020 primarily driven by continued market growth, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market with approximately 80% total market share. Net revenues for Lupron decreased 14% in 2020 primarily due to a near-term supply issue which has impacted product availability of certain formulations. Gross Margin Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 Gross margin $ 30,417 $ 25,827 $ 25,035 18 % 3 % as a percent of net revenues 66 % 78 % 76 % Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2020 decreased from 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of higher amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value step-up adjustments associated with the Allergan acquisition as well as collaboration profit sharing arrangements for Imbruvica and Venclexta. Selling, General and Administrative Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 Selling, general and administrative $ 11,299 $ 6,942 $ 7,399 63 % (6) % as a percent of net revenues 25 % 21 % 23 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2020 increased from 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of incremental SG&A expenses of Allergan, including transaction and integration costs resulting from the acquisition. Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 Research and development $ 6,557 $ 6,407 $ 10,329 2 % (38) % as a percent of net revenues 14 % 19 % 32 % Acquired in-process research and development $ 1,198 $ 385 $ 424 >100% (9) % Research and Development (R&D) expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2020 primarily due to the $1.0 billion intangible asset impairment charge in 2019, which represented the remaining value of the IPR&D acquired as part 39 | 2020 Form 10-K of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition following the decision to terminate the Rova-T R&D program. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge. R&D expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2020 were also favorably impacted by increased scale of the combined company for the period subsequent to the completion of the Allergan acquisition. Acquired IPR&D expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2020 included a charge of $750 million as a result of entering a collaboration agreement with Genmab A/S (Genmab) to research, develop and commercialize investigational bispecific antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2020 also included a charge of $200 million as a result of a collaboration agreement with I-Mab Biopharma (I-Mab) for the development and commercialization of lemzoparlimab for the treatment of multiple cancers. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Genmab and I-Mab agreements. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2019. Other Operating Expenses and Income Other operating income in 2019 included $550 million of income from a legal settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with a third party and $330 million of income related to an amended and restated license agreement between AbbVie and Reata. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Reata agreement. Other Non-Operating Expenses years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Interest expense $ 2,454 $ 1,784 $ 1,348 Interest income (174) (275) (204) Interest expense, net $ 2,280 $ 1,509 $ 1,144 Net foreign exchange loss $ 71 $ 42 $ 24 Other expense, net 5,614 3,006 18 Interest expense in 2020 increased compared to 2019 primarily due to a higher average debt balance associated with the financing of the Allergan acquisition as well as the incremental Allergan debt acquired, partially offset by the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the company’s debt obligations. Interest income in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the cash paid for the Allergan acquisition and the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates. Other expense, net included charges related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities of $5.8 billion in 2020 and $3.1 billion in 2019. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. In 2020, the change in fair value primarily included the increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated future sales driven by stronger market share uptake and favorable clinical trial results as well as lower interest rates. In 2019, the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability increased due to higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales, declining interest rates and passage of time. The higher probabilities of success primarily resulted from the April 2019 regulatory approvals of Skyrizi for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. These changes were partially offset by a $91 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T R&D program. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was negative 36% in 2020, 6% in 2019 and negative 9% in 2018. The effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, the cost of repatriation decisions, tax audit settlements and Boehringer Ingelheim accretion on contingent consideration. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2020 over the prior year was principally due to the recognition of a net tax benefit of $1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. 2020 Form 10-K | 40 FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Cash flows from: Operating activities $ 17,588 $ 13,324 $ 13,427 Investing activities (37,557) 596 (1,006) Financing activities (11,501) 18,708 (14,396) Operating cash flows in 2020 increased from 2019 and included the results of Allergan subsequent to the May 8 acquisition date. Operating cash flows in 2020 were favorably impacted by higher net revenues of the combined company and the timing of working capital cash flows, partially offset by acquisition-related cash expenses. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie’s contributions to its defined benefit plans of $367 million in 2020 and $727 million in 2019. Investing cash flows in 2020 primarily included $39.7 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Allergan offset by cash acquired of $1.5 billion. Investing cash flows also included net sales and maturities of investments totaling $1.5 billion, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion and capital expenditures of $798 million. Investing cash flows in 2019 included net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $2.1 billion resulting from the sale of substantially all of the company's investments in debt securities, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.1 billion and capital expenditures of $552 million. Financing cash flows in 2020 included the issuance of term loans totaling $3.0 billion under the existing $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. Additionally, financing cash flows included the May 2020 repayment of $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes at maturity, the September 2020 repayment of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% Allergan exchange notes at maturity, and the November 2020 repayments of €700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate Allergan exchange notes at maturity and $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Allergan exchange notes due February 2021. Financing cash flows in 2019 included the issuance of $30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate and fixed rate unsecured senior notes which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Additionally, financing cash flows in 2019 included the issuance of €1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes which the company used to redeem €1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.38% senior Euro notes that were due to mature in November 2019, as well as the repayment of a $3.0 billion 364-day term loan credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in June 2019. Cash dividend payments totaled $7.7 billion in 2020 and $6.4 billion in 2019. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by higher outstanding shares following the 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders in May 2020 as well as an increase in the dividend rate. On October 30, 2020, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.18 per share to $1.30 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 16, 2021 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2021. This reflects an increase of approximately 10.2% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 8 million shares for $757 million in 2020 and 4 million shares for $300 million in 2019. AbbVie cash-settled $201 million of its December 2018 open market purchases in January 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. In 2020 and 2019, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. Credit Risk AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an 41 | 2020 Form 10-K allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables. Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility AbbVie currently has a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2020, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. Credit Ratings Following the acquisition of Allergan, S&P Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. There were no changes in Moody's Investor Service of its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company’s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company’s outstanding debt. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020: (in millions) Total Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Short-term borrowings $ 34 $ 34 $ — $ — $ — Long-term debt, including current portion 84,948 8,422 16,643 16,197 43,686 Interest on long-term debt (a) 33,664 2,752 4,652 3,898 22,362 Non-cancelable operating and finance lease payments 1,154 229 323 208 394 Purchase obligations and other (b) 5,432 5,040 249 112 31 Other long-term liabilities (c) (d) (e) 18,478 1,029 3,036 4,144 10,269 Total $ 143,710 $ 17,506 $ 24,903 $ 24,559 $ 76,742 (a) Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2020. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2020. (b) Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business. (c) Excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits. 2020 Form 10-K | 42 (d) Includes $13.0 billion of contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. (e) Includes a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. AbbVie enters into R&D collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $27.0 billion in 2020, $18.8 billion in 2019 and $16.4 billion in 2018. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings. 43 | 2020 Form 10-K The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 89% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2020. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.

Cash Discounts and Product Returns Cash discounts and product returns, which totaled $2.4 billion in 2020, $1.6 billion in 2019 and $1.6 billion in 2018, are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2020. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2021 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020: 50 basis point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease Defined benefit plans Service and interest cost $ (89) $ 101 Projected benefit obligation (1,000) 1,140 Other post-employment plans Service and interest cost $ (6) $ 7 Projected benefit obligation (56) 63 2020 Form 10-K | 44 The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2020 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2021. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2021 by $94 million. The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2020 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2021. Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. 45 | 2020 Form 10-K For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Contingent Consideration The fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2020 was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs: Range Weighted Average (a) Discount rate 0.1% - 2.2% 1.1% Probability of payment for unachieved milestones 56% - 92% 64% Probability of payment for royalties by indication (b) 56% - 100% 91% Projected year of payments 2021 - 2034 2027 (a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. (b) Excludes early stage indications with 0% estimated probability of payment and includes approved indications with 100% probability of payment. Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment ranged from 56% to 89% at December 31, 2020.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019: 2020 2019 as of December 31 (in millions) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 7,818 1.213 $ (39) $ 6,217 1.116 $ (12) Japanese yen 837 103.9 (7) 820 108.7 — Canadian dollar 591 1.328 (23) 504 1.324 (6) British pound 275 1.341 3 427 1.305 (6) All other currencies 1,706 n/a (15) 1,508 n/a (10) Total $ 11,227 $ (81) $ 9,476 $ (34) The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.14 billion at December 31, 2020. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2020, the company has € 6.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate Risk The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $111 million at December 31, 2020. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. 47 | 2020 Form 10-K ITEM 8.

(AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100 % of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of Allergan plc (Allergan). Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding this acquisition. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration liabilities, financial instruments and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less. Discounts, rebates, sales incentives to customers, returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. 2020 Form 10-K | 54 For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. Sales incentives to customers are insignificant. In addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography. Research and Development Expenses Internal research and development (R&D) costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development collaborations, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product. Collaborations and Other Arrangements The company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements during the development stage are expensed to acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of milestones during the development stage are expensed to R&D expense in the consolidated statements of earnings when the milestone is achieved. Milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $ 1.8 billion in 2020, $ 1.1 billion in 2019 and $ 1.1 billion in 2018. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five-year period. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Investments Investments consist primarily of equity securities, held-to-maturity debt securities, marketable debt securities and time deposits. Investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value. Investments in 55 | 2020 Form 10-K equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at cost. Gains or losses on investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until realized, at which time the gains or losses are recognized in earnings. AbbVie periodically assesses its marketable debt securities for impairment and credit losses. When a decline in fair value of marketable debt security is due to credit related factors, an allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding charge to other expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. When AbbVie determines that a non-credit related impairment has occurred, the amortized cost basis of the investment, net of allowance for credit losses, is written down with a charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and an available-for-sale investment's unrealized loss is reclassified from AOCI to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any impairments and credit losses that were recorded in net earnings. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable and is determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, other currently available information including customer financial condition, and both current and forecasted economic conditions. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Cost includes material and conversion costs. Inventories consisted of the following: as of December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Finished goods $ 1,318 $ 485 Work-in-process 1,201 942 Raw materials 791 386 Inventories $ 3,310 $ 1,813 Property and Equipment as of December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Land $ 288 $ 72 Buildings 2,555 1,613 Equipment 6,976 6,012 Construction in progress 1,040 491 Property and equipment, gross 10,859 8,188 Less accumulated depreciation ( 5,611 ) ( 5,226 ) Property and equipment, net $ 5,248 $ 2,962 Depreciation for property and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life for buildings ranges from 10 to 50 years. Buildings include leasehold improvements which are amortized over the life of the related facility lease (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful life for equipment ranges from 2 to 25 years. Equipment includes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use and is amortized over 3 to 10 years. Depreciation expense was $ 666 million in 2020, $ 464 million in 2019 and $ 471 million in 2018. Leases Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. For leases commencing or modified in 2019 or later, AbbVie does not separate lease components from non-lease components. The company records lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. AbbVie generally uses an incremental borrowing rate to discount its lease liabilities, as the rate implicit in the lease is typically not 2020 Form 10-K | 56 readily determinable. Certain lease agreements include renewal options that are under the company's control. AbbVie includes optional renewal periods in the lease term only when it is reasonably certain that AbbVie will exercise its option. Variable lease payments include payments to lessors for taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs as well as payments that are adjusted based on an index or rate. The company's lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Litigation and Contingencies Loss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. Business Combinations AbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Acquired In-Process Research and Development In an asset acquisition, the initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects acquired are expensed as IPR&D in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to 57 | 2020 Form 10-K regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. In a business combination, the fair value of IPR&D projects acquired are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&D costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. For derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. The company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI. Derivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2016-13 In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . The standard changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, the standard requires the use of a new forward-looking ""expected credit loss"" model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the standard now requires allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2020. Upon adoption of the standard, accounts receivable are stated at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable and is determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, other currently available information including customer financial condition, and both current and forecasted economic conditions. The adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements. The allowance for credit losses was $ 262 million at December 31, 2020. There were no significant changes in credit loss risk factors that impacted the company's recorded allowance during 2020. 2020 Form 10-K | 58 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted ASU No. 2019-12 In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) . The standard includes simplifications related to accounting for income taxes including removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2021. AbbVie has completed its assessment of the new standard and concluded that the adoption will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Note 3 Supplemental Financial Information Interest Expense, Net years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Interest expense $ 2,454 $ 1,784 $ 1,348 Interest income ( 174 ) ( 275 ) ( 204 ) Interest expense, net $ 2,280 $ 1,509 $ 1,144 Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Sales rebates $ 7,188 $ 4,484 Dividends payable 2,335 1,771 Accounts payable 2,276 1,452 Salaries, wages and commissions 1,669 830 Royalty and license arrangements 483 324 Other 6,208 2,971 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 20,159 $ 11,832 Other Long-Term Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Contingent consideration liabilities $ 12,289 $ 7,201 Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 5,680 2,772 Income taxes payable 3,847 3,453 Pension and other post-employment benefits 3,413 2,949 Other 2,378 1,222 Other long-term liabilities $ 27,607 $ 17,597 59 | 2020 Form 10-K Note 4 Earnings Per Share AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive. The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method: Years ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 2018 Basic EPS Net earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 4,616 $ 7,882 $ 5,687 Earnings allocated to participating securities 60 40 30 Earnings available to common shareholders $ 4,556 $ 7,842 $ 5,657 Weighted average basic shares of common stock outstanding 1,667 1,481 1,541 Basic earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 2.73 $ 5.30 $ 3.67 Diluted EPS Net earnings attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 4,616 $ 7,882 $ 5,687 Earnings allocated to participating securities 60 40 30 Earnings available to common shareholders $ 4,556 $ 7,842 $ 5,657 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 1,667 1,481 1,541 Effect of dilutive securities 6 3 5 Weighted average diluted shares of common stock outstanding 1,673 1,484 1,546 Diluted earnings per share attributable to AbbVie Inc. $ 2.72 $ 5.28 $ 3.66 Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented. Note 5 Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements Acquisition of Allergan On May 8, 2020, AbbVie completed its previously announced acquisition of all outstanding equity interests in Allergan in a cash and stock transaction. Allergan is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing branded pharmaceutical, device, biologic, surgical and regenerative medicine products for patients around the world. The combination creates a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline is enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio benefits from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. Under the terms of the acquisition, each ordinary share of Allergan common stock was converted into the right to receive (i) $ 120.30 in cash and (ii) 0.8660 of a share of AbbVie common stock. Total consideration for the acquisition of Allergan is summarized as follows: (in millions) Cash consideration paid to Allergan shareholders (a) $ 39,675 Fair value of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders (b) 23,979 Fair value of AbbVie equity awards issued to Allergan equity award holders (c) 430 Total consideration $ 64,084 (a) Represents cash consideration transferred of $ 120.30 per outstanding Allergan ordinary share based on 330 million Allergan ordinary shares outstanding at closing. 2020 Form 10-K | 60 (b) Represents the acquisition date fair value of 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders based on the exchange ratio of 0.8660 AbbVie shares for each outstanding Allergan ordinary share at the May 8, 2020 closing price of $ 83.96 per share. (c) Represents the pre-acquisition service portion of the fair value of 11 million AbbVie stock options and 8 million RSUs issued to Allergan equity award holders. The acquisition of Allergan has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2020. As a result, AbbVie recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the company made certain measurement period adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation, including: (i) an increase to developed product rights intangible assets of $ 9.1 billion; (ii) an increase to IPR&D intangible assets of $ 710 million; (iii) an increase to property and equipment of $ 215 million; (iv) other individually insignificant adjustments for a net increase to identifiable net assets of $ 73 million; and (v) a corresponding decrease to goodwill of $ 10.0 billion. The measurement period adjustments primarily resulted from revised future cash flow estimates for certain intangible assets and completing valuations of property and equipment. These measurement period adjustments have been reflected in the table below. The company made these measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and did not result from intervening events subsequent to such date. These adjustments did not have a significant impact on AbbVie's results of operations. Finalization of the valuation during the measurement period could result in a change in the amounts recorded for the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets, goodwill and income taxes among other items. The completion of the valuation will occur no later than one year from the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date: (in millions) Assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and equivalents $ 1,537 Short-term investments 1,421 Accounts receivable 2,374 Inventories 2,340 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,982 Investments 137 Property and equipment 2,127 Intangible assets Developed product rights 67,330 In-process research and development 1,750 Other noncurrent assets 1,395 Short-term borrowings ( 60 ) Current portion of long-term debt and finance lease obligations ( 1,899 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 5,852 ) Long-term debt and finance lease obligations ( 18,937 ) Deferred income taxes ( 3,792 ) Other long-term liabilities ( 4,765 ) Total identifiable net assets 47,088 Goodwill 16,996 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 64,084 The fair value step-up adjustment to inventories of $ 1.2 billion is being amortized to cost of products sold when the inventory is sold to customers, which is expected to be within approximately one year from the acquisition date. Intangible assets relate to $ 67.3 billion of developed product rights and $ 1.8 billion of IPR&D. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately twelve years using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the ""income approach"" which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market 61 | 2020 Form 10-K participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life cycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other factors. The fair value of long-term debt was determined by quoted market prices as of the acquisition date and the total purchase price adjustment of $ 1.3 billion is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt. Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Specifically, the goodwill recognized from the acquisition of Allergan represents the value of additional growth platforms and an expanded revenue base as well as anticipated operational synergies and cost savings from the creation of a single combined global organization. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Following the acquisition date, the operating results of Allergan have been included in the consolidated financial statements. For the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2020, net revenues attributable to Allergan were $ 10.3 billion and operating losses attributable to Allergan were $ 1.1 billion, inclusive of $ 4.0 billion of intangible asset amortization and $ 1.2 billion of inventory fair value step-up amortization. Acquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $ 781 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $ 103 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 which were included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Pro Forma Financial Information The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of AbbVie and Allergan for 2020 and 2019 as if the acquisition of Allergan had occurred on January 1, 2019: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Net revenues $ 50,521 $ 49,028 Net earnings (loss) 6,746 ( 38 ) The unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie and Allergan. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2019 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the current preliminary fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired; the incremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with acquisition date inventory; the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition; and the reclassification of acquisition-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2019. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition. Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity Cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $ 1.4 billion in 2020, $ 1.1 billion in 2019 and $ 736 million in 2018. AbbVie recorded acquired IPR&D charges of $ 1.2 billion in 2020, $ 385 million in 2019 and $ 424 million in 2018. Significant arrangements impacting 2020, 2019 and 2018, some of which require contingent milestone payments, are summarized below. Luminera In October 2020, AbbVie entered into an agreement with Luminera, a privately held aesthetics company based in Israel, to acquire Luminera's full dermal filler portfolio and R&D pipeline including HArmonyCa, a dermal filler intended for facial soft tissue augmentation. The aggregate accounting purchase price of $ 186 million was comprised of a $ 122 million upfront cash payment and $ 64 million for the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, for which AbbVie may owe up to $ 90 million in future payments upon achievement of certain commercial milestones. HArmonyCa is currently commercially available in Israel and Brazil and AbbVie will continue to develop this product for its international and U.S. markets. The agreement was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. As of the 2020 Form 10-K | 62 acquisition date, AbbVie acquired $ 127 million of intangible assets for in-process research and development and $ 33 million of intangible assets for developed product rights. Other assets and liabilities assumed were insignificant. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $ 12 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. I-Mab Biopharma In September 2020, AbbVie and I-Mab Biopharma (I-Mab) entered into a collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of lemzoparlimab, an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody internally discovered and developed by I-Mab for the treatment of multiple cancers. Both companies will collaborate to design and conduct further global clinical trials to evaluate lemzoparlimab. The collaboration provides AbbVie an exclusive global license, excluding greater China, to develop and commercialize lemzoparlimab. The companies will share manufacturing responsibilities with AbbVie being the primary manufacturer for global supply. The agreement also allows for potential collaboration on future CD47-related therapeutic agents, subject to further licenses to explore each other's related programs in their respective territories. The terms of the arrangement include an initial upfront payment of $ 180 million to exclusively license lemzoparlimab along with a milestone payment of $ 20 million based on the Phase I results, for a total of $ 200 million, which was recorded to IPR&D in the consolidated statements of earnings in the fourth quarter of 2020 after regulatory approval of the transaction. In addition, I-Mab will be eligible to receive up to $ 1.7 billion upon the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and commercial milestones, and AbbVie will pay tiered royalties from low-to-mid teen percentages on global net revenues outside of greater China. Genmab A/S In June 2020, AbbVie and Genmab A/S (Genmab) entered into a collaboration agreement to jointly develop and commercialize three of Genmab's early-stage investigational bispecific antibody therapeutics and entered into a discovery research collaboration for future differentiated antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, Genmab granted to AbbVie an exclusive license to its epcoritamab (DuoBody-CD3xCD20), DuoHexaBody-CD37 and DuoBody-CD3x5T4 programs. For epcoritamab, the companies will share commercial responsibilities in the U.S. and Japan, with AbbVie responsible for further global commercialization. Genmab will record net revenues in the U.S. and Japan, and the parties will share equally in pre-tax profits from these sales. Genmab will receive tiered royalties on remaining global sales. For the discovery research partnership, Genmab will conduct Phase 1 studies for these programs and AbbVie retains the right to opt-in to program development. During 2020, AbbVie made an upfront payment of $ 750 million, which was recorded to IPR&D in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $ 3.2 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones for all programs. Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In October 2019, AbbVie and Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Reata) entered into an amended and restated license agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Reata reacquired exclusive development, manufacturing and commercialization rights concerning its proprietary Nrf2 activator product platform originally licensed to AbbVie for territories outside of the United States with respect to bardoxolone methyl and worldwide with respect to omaveloxolone and other next-generation Nrf2 activators.

Note 6 Collaborations The company has ongoing transactions with other entities through collaboration agreements. The following represent the significant collaboration agreements impacting 2020, 2019 and 2018. Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc. In December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of Imbruvica, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and certain compounds structurally related to Imbruvica, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States. The collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize Imbruvica outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $ 200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60 % of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40 % of collaboration development costs. In the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of Imbruvica are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share.

The company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. As of December 31, 2020, there were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses. Intangible Assets, Net The following table summarizes intangible assets: 2020 2019 as of December 31 (in millions) Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Definite-lived intangible assets Developed product rights $ 87,707 $ ( 11,620 ) $ 76,087 $ 19,547 $ ( 6,405 ) $ 13,142 License agreements 7,828 ( 2,916 ) 4,912 7,798 ( 2,291 ) 5,507 Total definite-lived intangible assets 95,535 ( 14,536 ) 80,999 27,345 ( 8,696 ) 18,649 Indefinite-lived research and development 1,877 — 1,877 — — — Total intangible assets, net $ 97,412 $ ( 14,536 ) $ 82,876 $ 27,345 $ ( 8,696 ) $ 18,649 Definite-Lived Intangible Assets The increase in definite-lived intangible assets during 2020 was primarily due to the acquisition of Allergan in the second quarter of 2020. The intangible assets will be amortized using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding this acquisition. 65 | 2020 Form 10-K Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 1 to 16 years with an average of 12 years for developed product rights and 11 years for license agreements. Amortization expense was $ 5.8 billion in 2020, $ 1.6 billion in 2019 and $ 1.3 billion in 2018 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2020 is as follows: (in billions) 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Anticipated annual amortization expense $ 7.7 $ 7.2 $ 7.5 $ 8.0 $ 8.4 No definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in 2020, 2019 or 2018. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPR&D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The increase in indefinite-lived research and development assets during 2020 was due to the acquisition of Allergan in the second quarter of 2020 and the acquisition of Luminera in the fourth quarter of 2020. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding these acquisitions. The company performs its annual impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. No indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in 2020. In 2019, following the announcement of the decision to terminate the rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) R&D program, the company recorded an impairment charge of $ 1.0 billion which represented the remaining value of the IPR&D acquired as part of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition. This termination was subsequent to the decision to stop enrollment for the TAHOE trial, which resulted in an impairment charge of $ 5.1 billion in 2018. These impairment charges were recorded to R&D expense in the consolidated statements of earnings in 2019 and 2018. Note 8 Integration and Restructuring Plans Allergan Integration Plan Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. To achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur approximately $ 2 billion of charges through 2022. These costs will consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses. The following table summarizes the charges associated with the Allergan acquisition integration plan: 2020 year ended December 31 (in millions) Severance and employee benefits Other integration Cost of products sold $ 109 $ 21 Research and development 199 177 Selling, general and administrative 388 237 Total charges $ 696 $ 435 The following table summarizes the cash activity in the recorded liability associated with the integration plan: 2020 year ended December 31 (in millions) Severance and employee benefits Other integration Charges $ 594 $ 435 Payments and other adjustments ( 227 ) ( 415 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 367 $ 20 2020 Form 10-K | 66 Other Restructuring AbbVie continuously evaluates its operations to identify opportunities to optimize its manufacturing and R&D operations, commercial infrastructure and administrative costs and to respond to changes in its business environment.

In March 2019, AbbVie repaid a $ 3.0 billion 364 -day term loan credit agreement that was drawn on in June 2018 and was scheduled to mature in June 2019. 71 | 2020 Form 10-K Maturities of Long-Term Debt The following table summarizes AbbVie's debt maturities as of December 31, 2020: as of and for the years ending December 31 (in millions) 2021 $ 8,422 2022 12,428 2023 4,215 2024 7,426 2025 8,771 Thereafter 43,686 Total obligations and commitments 84,948 Fair value hedges, unamortized bond premiums and discounts, deferred financing costs and finance lease obligations 1,074 Total long-term debt and finance lease obligations $ 86,022 Contingencies and Guarantees In connection with the separation, AbbVie has indemnified Abbott for all liabilities resulting from the operation of AbbVie's business other than income tax liabilities with respect to periods prior to the distribution date and other liabilities as agreed to by AbbVie and Abbott. AbbVie has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements and no special-purpose entities. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie has periodically entered into third-party agreements, such as the assignment of product rights, which have resulted in AbbVie becoming secondarily liable for obligations for which AbbVie had previously been primarily liable. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. Note 11 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Risk Management Policy The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. AbbVie's hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. AbbVie also periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the company's outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required. Financial Instruments Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $ 1.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 1.0 billion at December 31, 2019, are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than 18 months. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2020 will be reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement. In the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $ 10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the proposed acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in November 2019 resulting in a gain of $ 383 million recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). This gain is reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $ 2.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. The contracts were designated as cash flow hedges 2020 Form 10-K | 72 and are recorded at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and are reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt. The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $ 8.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 7.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had an aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges of € 6.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and € 3.6 billion at December 31, 2019. In addition, the company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges with notional amounts totaling € 971 million at December 31, 2020 and € 971 million, £ 204 million, and CHF 62 million at December 31, 2019. The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument. AbbVie is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $ 4.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 10.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.

The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones 75 | 2020 Form 10-K and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. The fair value of the company's contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2020 was calculated using the following significant unobservable inputs: Range Weighted Average (a) Discount rate 0.1 % - 2.2 % 1.1 % Probability of payment for unachieved milestones 56 % - 92 % 64 % Probability of payment for royalties by indication (b) 56 % - 100 % 91 % Projected year of payments 2021 - 2034 2027 (a) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. (b) Excludes early stage indications with 0 % estimated probability of payment and includes approved indications with 100 % probability of payment. Excluding approved indications, the estimated probability of payment ranged from 56 % to 89 % at December 31, 2020. There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 7,340 $ 4,483 $ 4,534 Additions (a) 225 — — Change in fair value recognized in net earnings 5,753 3,091 49 Payments ( 321 ) ( 234 ) ( 100 ) Ending balance $ 12,997 $ 7,340 $ 4,483 (a) Additions during the year ended December 31, 2020 represent contingent consideration liabilities assumed in the Allergan acquisition as well as contingent consideration resulting from the Luminera acquisition. The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company recorded a $ 4.7 billion increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated future sales driven by stronger market share uptake and favorable clinical trial results as well as lower interest rates. During the second quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 2.3 billion increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales and declining interest rates. The higher probabilities of success resulted from the April 2019 regulatory approvals of Skyrizi for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. During the third quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 91 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T R&D program. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recorded a $ 428 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to a reduction in probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval. 2020 Form 10-K | 76 Certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

The company records these investments at cost and remeasures them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $ 102 million as of December 31, 2020 and $ 66 million as of December 31, 2019. No significant cumulative upward or downward adjustments have been recorded for these investments as of December 31, 2020. Concentrations of Risk Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 72 % as of December 31, 2020 and 68 % as of December 31, 2019, and substantially all of AbbVie's net revenues in the United States were to these three wholesalers. Humira (adalimumab) is AbbVie's single largest product and accounted for approximately 43 % of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2020, 58 % in 2019 and 61 % in 2018. 77 | 2020 Form 10-K Note 12 Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie sponsors various pension and other post-employment benefit plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. In addition, AbbVie provides medical benefits, primarily to eligible retirees in the United States and Puerto Rico, through other post-retirement benefit plans. Net obligations for these plans have been reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

The 2019 actuarial losses of $ 1.7 billion for qualified pension plans and $ 451 million for other post-employment plans were primarily driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate from 2018. A change to AbbVie's U.S. retiree health benefit plan was approved in 2020 and communicated to employees and retirees in October 2020. Beginning in 2022, Medicare-eligible retirees and Medicare-eligible dependents will choose health care coverage from insurance providers through a private Medicare exchange. AbbVie will continue to provide financial support to Medicare-eligible retirees. This change decreased AbbVie's post-employment benefit obligation and increased AbbVie's unrecognized prior service credit as of December 31, 2020 by $ 397 million. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie assumed certain post-employment benefit obligations which were recorded at fair value. Upon acquisition in the second quarter of 2020, the excess of projected benefit obligations over the plan assets was recognized as a liability totaling $ 156 million.

(f) Investments in cash and cash equivalents. Equities and registered investment companies having quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are quoted at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. Investments held in pooled investment funds, common collective trusts or limited partnerships are valued at the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is provided by the fund administrator and is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are established for each plan and are generally made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The 2020 target investment allocation for the AbbVie Pension Plan was 50 % in equity securities, 20 % in fixed income securities and 30 % in asset allocation strategies and other holdings. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets of the AbbVie Pension Plan or of any other plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption for each plan is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. Expected Benefit Payments The following table summarizes total benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants including payments funded from both plan and company assets: years ending December 31 (in millions) Defined benefit plans Other post-employment plans 2021 $ 284 $ 23 2022 301 29 2023 319 31 2024 339 33 2025 362 36 2026 to 2030 2,169 217 Defined Contribution Plan AbbVie's principal defined contribution plans are the AbbVie Savings Plan and the Allergan Savings Plan. AbbVie recorded expense of $ 191 million in 2020, $ 102 million in 2019 and $ 89 million in 2018 related to these plans. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees. Note 13 Equity Stock-Based Compensation AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP), which provides for several different forms of benefits, including nonqualified stock options, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the 2013 ISP, 100 million shares of AbbVie common stock were reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees. The 2013 ISP also facilitated the assumption of certain awards granted under Abbott’s incentive stock program, which were adjusted and converted into Abbott and AbbVie stock-based awards as a result of AbbVie's separation from Abbott. AbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for 2020 Form 10-K | 82 stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least 10 years of service. Stock-based compensation expense is principally related to awards issued pursuant to the 2013 ISP and is summarized as follows: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Cost of products sold $ 47 $ 29 $ 27 Research and development 247 171 169 Selling, general and administrative 459 230 225 Pre-tax compensation expense 753 430 421 Tax benefit 131 80 73 After-tax compensation expense $ 622 $ 350 $ 348 Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $ 34 million in 2020, $ 15 million in 2019 and $ 78 million in 2018. Stock Options Stock options awarded to employees typically have a contractual term of 10 years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three-year period. The exercise price is equal to at least 100 % of the market value on the date of grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted were $ 12.14 in 2020, $ 12.54 in 2019 and $ 21.63 in 2018. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, during the second quarter of 2020, AbbVie issued 11.2 million stock options to holders of Allergan options as a result of the conversion of such options. These options were fair-valued using a lattice valuation model. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the Allergan acquisition. The following table summarizes AbbVie stock option activity in 2020: (options in thousands, aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Options Weighted- average exercise price Weighted-average remaining life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value Outstanding at December 31, 2019 6,761 $ 60.39 5.9 $ 207 Granted 1,995 93.50 Granted in acquisition 11,152 70.48 Exercised ( 4,129 ) 51.29 Lapsed ( 88 ) 107.33 Outstanding at December 31, 2020 15,691 $ 73.90 4.7 $ 559 Exercisable at December 31, 2020 12,440 $ 69.99 3.6 $ 498 The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 186 million in 2020, $ 22 million in 2019 and $ 215 million in 2018. The total fair value of options vested during 2020 was $ 292 million. As of December 31, 2020, $ 13 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . RSUs and Performance Shares RSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees generally vest in ratable increments over a three or four-year period. Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period. The majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and other key employees are performance-based. Equity awards granted to senior executives and other key employees consist of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares as well as non-qualified stock options described above. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a three-year performance period. For awards granted in 2020, performance is based on AbbVie's return on invested capital (ROIC) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life science companies. For awards granted in 2018 and 2019, the tranches tied to 2020 performance are based on AbbVie’s return on equity (ROE) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. The recipient may receive one share of AbbVie common stock for each vested award. The performance shares have the potential to vest 83 | 2020 Form 10-K over a three-year performance period and may be earned based on AbbVie’s EPS achievement and AbbVie’s total stockholder return (TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-vested RSUs and performance shares accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs and performance shares generally is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the quoted price of AbbVie’s common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table summarizes AbbVie RSU and performance share activity for 2020: (share units in thousands) Share units Weighted-average grant date fair value Outstanding at December 31, 2019 10,232 $ 81.72 Granted 5,524 92.35 Granted in acquisition 8,234 83.96 Vested ( 6,667 ) 80.09 Forfeited ( 1,405 ) 84.13 Outstanding at December 31, 2020 15,918 $ 87.03 The fair market value of RSUs and performance shares (as applicable) vested was $ 618 million in 2020, $ 371 million in 2019 and $ 583 million in 2018. In connection with the Allergan acquisition, during the second quarter of 2020, AbbVie issued 8.2 million RSUs to holders of Allergan equity awards based on a conversion factor described in the transaction agreement. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the Allergan acquisition. As of December 31, 2020, $ 579 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs and performance shares is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . Cash Dividends Cash dividends declared per common share totaled $ 4.84 in 2020, $ 4.39 in 2019 and $ 3.95 in 2018. The following table summarizes quarterly cash dividends declared during 2020, 2019 and 2018: 2020 2019 2018 Date Declared Payment Date Dividend Per Share Date Declared Payment Date Dividend Per Share Date Declared Payment Date Dividend Per Share 10/30/20 02/16/21 $ 1.30 11/01/19 02/14/20 $ 1.18 11/02/18 02/15/19 $ 1.07 09/11/20 11/16/20 $ 1.18 09/06/19 11/15/19 $ 1.07 09/07/18 11/15/18 $ 0.96 06/17/20 08/14/20 $ 1.18 06/20/19 08/15/19 $ 1.07 06/14/18 08/15/18 $ 0.96 02/20/20 05/15/20 $ 1.18 02/21/19 05/15/19 $ 1.07 02/15/18 05/15/18 $ 0.96 Stock Repurchase Program The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased under these programs are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses and are available for general corporate purposes. AbbVie repurchased 8 million shares for $ 757 million in 2020 and 4 million shares for $ 300 million in 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $ 3.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $ 10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. On December 13, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $ 5.0 billion increase to the existing $ 10.0 billion stock repurchase program. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased approximately 109 million shares for $ 10.7 billion in 2018. Under previous stock repurchase programs, AbbVie made open-market share repurchases of approximately 11 million shares for $ 1.3 billion in 2018. 2020 Form 10-K | 84 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table summarizes the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for 2020, 2019 and 2018: (in millions) (brackets denote losses) Foreign currency translation adjustments Net investment hedging activities Pension and post-employment benefits Marketable security activities Cash flow hedging activities Total Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ ( 439 ) $ ( 203 ) $ ( 1,919 ) $ — $ ( 166 ) $ ( 2,727 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 391 ) 138 84 ( 14 ) 156 ( 27 ) Net losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — — 113 4 157 274 Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 391 ) 138 197 ( 10 ) 313 247 Balance as of December 31, 2018 ( 830 ) ( 65 ) ( 1,722 ) ( 10 ) 147 ( 2,480 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 98 ) 95 ( 1,330 ) 12 298 ( 1,023 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — ( 21 ) 87 ( 2 ) ( 157 ) ( 93 ) Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 98 ) 74 ( 1,243 ) 10 141 ( 1,116 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 ( 928 ) 9 ( 2,965 ) — 288 ( 3,596 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 1,511 ( 785 ) ( 300 ) — ( 108 ) 318 Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — ( 14 ) 198 — ( 23 ) 161 Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) 1,511 ( 799 ) ( 102 ) — ( 131 ) 479 Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 583 $ ( 790 ) $ ( 3,067 ) $ — $ 157 $ ( 3,117 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling gains of $ 1.5 billion in 2020 which were principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the Euro on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive income (loss) included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling losses of $ 98 million in 2019 and $ 391 million in 2018 which were principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive loss for 2019 included pension and post-employment benefit plan losses of $ 1.2 billion primarily due to an actuarial loss driven by lower discount rates. See Note 12 for additional information. 85 | 2020 Form 10-K The table below presents the impact on AbbVie's consolidated statements of earnings for significant amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss: years ended December 31 (in millions) (brackets denote gains) 2020 2019 2018 Net investment hedging activities Gains on derivative amount excluded from effectiveness testing (a) $ ( 18 ) $ ( 27 ) $ — Tax expense 4 6 — Total reclassifications, net of tax $ ( 14 ) $ ( 21 ) $ — Pension and post-employment benefits Amortization of actuarial losses and other (b) $ 251 $ 110 $ 141 Tax benefit ( 53 ) ( 23 ) ( 28 ) Total reclassifications, net of tax $ 198 $ 87 $ 113 Cash flow hedging activities Losses (gains) on foreign currency forward exchange contracts (c) $ ( 23 ) $ ( 167 ) $ 161 Gains on treasury rate lock agreements (a) ( 24 ) ( 3 ) — Losses (gains) on interest rate swap contracts (a) 17 ( 1 ) — Tax expense (benefit) 7 14 ( 4 ) Total reclassifications, net of tax $ ( 23 ) $ ( 157 ) $ 157 (a) Amounts are included in interest expense, net (see Note 11).

The effective income tax rates in 2020, 2019 and 2018 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, the cost of repatriation decisions, tax audit settlements and Boehringer Ingelheim accretion on contingent consideration. The 2020 effective income tax rate included the recognition of a net tax benefit of $ 1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. The effective income tax rate in 2020, 2019 and 2018 included impacts related to U.S. tax reform. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was signed into law in December 2017, resulting in significant changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, including a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously untaxed. The Act also created a minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The company’s accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings is to report the tax effects on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense. In 2018, there was a favorable impact of the effective date of provisions of the Act related to the earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. For 2019, the impact of the Act affected the full year earnings of these subsidiaries, resulting in additional tax expense compared to the previous year. The effective income tax rates for 2019 and 2018 also included the effects of Stemcentrx impairment related expenses. 87 | 2020 Form 10-K Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets Compensation and employee benefits $ 1,109 $ 810 Accruals and reserves 438 371 Chargebacks and rebates 555 477 Advance payments 324 615 Net operating losses and other credit carryforwards 2,765 838 Other 1,371 406 Total deferred tax assets 6,562 3,517 Valuation allowances ( 1,203 ) ( 731 ) Total net deferred tax assets 5,359 2,786 Deferred tax liabilities Excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets ( 5,274 ) ( 2,712 ) Excess of book basis over tax basis in investments ( 335 ) ( 249 ) Other ( 982 ) ( 440 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 6,591 ) ( 3,401 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 1,232 ) $ ( 615 ) The increases in deferred tax liabilities are primarily due to the acquisition of Allergan in which the company recorded the excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets. The increases in deferred tax assets are primarily due to deferred tax asset recognition related to the intra-group transfer of intellectual property. As of December 31, 2020, the company had U.S. federal and state credit carryforwards of $ 293 million as well as U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $ 4.3 billion, which will expire at various times through 2040. The remaining U.S. federal and non-U.S. loss carryforwards of $ 5.8 billion have no expiration. The company had valuation allowances of $ 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $ 731 million as of December 31, 2019. These were principally related to foreign and state net operating losses and credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. The Act significantly changed the timing and manner in which earnings of foreign subsidiaries are subject to U.S. tax. Therefore, unremitted foreign earnings previously considered indefinitely reinvested that were subject to the Act’s transition tax are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. Post-2017 earnings subject to the U.S. minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings or eligible for the 100 percent foreign dividends received deduction are also not considered indefinitely reinvested earnings. However, the company generally considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution) to be permanent in duration. The unrecognized tax liability is not practicable to determine. Unrecognized Tax Benefits years ended December 31 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Beginning balance $ 2,661 $ 2,852 $ 2,701 Increase due to acquisition 2,674 — — Increase due to current year tax positions 91 113 163 Increase due to prior year tax positions 59 499 110 Decrease due to prior year tax positions ( 7 ) ( 21 ) ( 36 ) Settlements ( 141 ) ( 749 ) ( 79 ) Lapse of statutes of limitations ( 73 ) ( 33 ) ( 7 ) Ending balance $ 5,264 $ 2,661 $ 2,852 AbbVie and Abbott entered into a tax sharing agreement, effective on the date of separation, which provides that Abbott is liable for and has indemnified AbbVie against all income tax liabilities for periods prior to the separation. AbbVie will 2020 Form 10-K | 88 be responsible for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties for periods after separation or in instances where an existing entity was transferred to AbbVie upon separation. If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the company's effective tax rate is $ 5.0 billion in 2020 and $ 2.4 billion in 2019. Of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the table above as of December 31, 2020, AbbVie would be indemnified for approximately $ 81 million. The ""Increase due to current year tax positions"" and ""Increase due to prior year tax positions"" in the table above include amounts related to federal, state and international tax items. ""Increase due to acquisition"" in the table above includes amounts related to federal, state and international tax items recorded in acquisition accounting related to the Allergan acquisition. AbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie recognized gross income tax expense of $ 142 million in 2020, $ 51 million in 2019 and $ 73 million in 2018, for interest and penalties related to income tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross interest and penalties of $ 642 million at December 31, 2020, $ 191 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 190 million at December 31, 2018. The company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible during the next 12 months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months up to $ 68 million. All significant federal, state, local and international matters have been concluded for years through 2008. The company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. Note 15 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. The most significant matters are described below. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation was approximately $ 60 million as of December 31, 2020 and approximately $ 290 million as of December 31, 2019. Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. In addition, other operating income in 2019 included $ 550 million of income from a legal settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with a third party. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Antitrust Litigation Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits pending in federal court consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by Niaspan direct purchasers and one brought by Niaspan end-payers. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2460. In August 2019, the court certified a class of direct purchasers of Niaspan. In June 2020, the court denied the end-payers' motion to certify a class. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. 89 | 2020 Form 10-K In September 2014, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit, FTC v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2011 patent litigation with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of that litigation violated federal antitrust law. In May 2015, the court dismissed the FTC’s settlement-related claim. In June 2018, following a bench trial, the court found for the FTC on its sham litigation claim and ordered a disgorgement remedy of $ 448 million, plus prejudgment interest. The court denied the FTC’s request for injunctive relief. In September 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the district court’s finding of sham litigation with respect to one generic company and affirmed with respect to the other but held the FTC lacked authority to obtain a disgorgement remedy and vacated the district court’s award. The Third Circuit also affirmed the district court’s denial of the FTC’s injunction request and reinstated the FTC’s settlement-related claim for further proceedings in the district court. In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that 2006 patent litigation settlements and related agreements by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) with three generic companies violated federal antitrust law, and also making allegations similar to those in FTC v. AbbVie Inc. (above). In May 2020, Perrigo Company and related entities filed a lawsuit against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, making sham litigation allegations similar to those in FTC v. AbbVie Inc . (above). In October 2020, the Perrigo lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for New Jersey. Between March and May 2019, 12 putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by indirect Humira purchasers, alleging that AbbVie’s settlements with biosimilar manufacturers and AbbVie’s Humira patent portfolio violated state and federal antitrust laws. The court consolidated these lawsuits as In re: Humira (Adalimumab) Antitrust Litigation . In June 2020, the court dismissed the consolidated litigation with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal. Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC and others generally alleging that 2009 and 2010 patent litigation settlements involving Namenda entered into between Forest and generic companies and other conduct by Forest involving Namenda, violated state antitrust, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed by indirect purchasers of Namenda, are consolidated as In re: Namenda Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Lawsuits are pending against Allergan Inc. generally alleging that Allergan’s petitioning to the U.S. Patent Office and Food and Drug Administration and other conduct by Allergan involving Restasis violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, certified as a class action filed on behalf of indirect purchasers of Restasis, are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the MDL Rules as In re: Restasis (Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion) Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2819. Lawsuits are pending against Forest Laboratories, LLC and others generally alleging that 2012 and 2013 patent litigation settlements involving Bystolic with six generic manufacturers violated federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuits, purported class actions filed on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of Bystolic, are consolidated as In re: Bystolic Antitrust Litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In July 2019, the New Mexico Attorney General filed a lawsuit, State of New Mexico ex rel. Balderas v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , in New Mexico District Court for Santa Fe County against AbbVie and other companies alleging their marketing of AndroGel violated New Mexico’s Unfair Practices Act. In October 2020, the state added a claim under the New Mexico False Advertising Act. 2020 Form 10-K | 90 Shareholder and Securities Litigation In June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc. , was filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in connection with its proposed transaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were filed between July 2017 and October 2019 against AbbVie and in some instances its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds. The court granted motions dismissing the claims of three investment-fund plaintiffs, which they are appealing. One of these plaintiffs refiled its lawsuit in New York state court in June 2020 while the appeal of its dismissal in Illinois is pending. In November 2020, the New York Supreme Court for the County of New York dismissed that lawsuit. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. In October 2018, a federal securities lawsuit, Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al ., was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for Humira sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2017 were misleading because they omitted alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value that allegedly induced Humira prescriptions. In February 2020, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, Elfers v. Gonzalez, et al. , was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that certain AbbVie directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties regarding alleged misconduct in connection with Humira patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value and in connection with the announcements of results of AbbVie’s 2018 Dutch auction tender offer.

Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan's textured breast implants. The lawsuits, which were filed by Allergan shareholders, have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as In re: Allergan plc Securities Litigation . The plaintiffs generally seek compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees. In September 2019, the court partially granted Allergan's motion to dismiss. In September 2020, the court denied plaintiffs’ class certification motion because it found the lead plaintiff to be an inadequate representative of the proposed class but allowed another putative class member to propose itself as a new lead plaintiff. In December 2020, the court appointed a new lead plaintiff. Lawsuits are pending against Allergan and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan’s former Actavis generics unit and its alleged anticompetitive conduct with other generic drug companies. The lawsuits were filed by Allergan shareholders and consist of three purported class actions and one individual action that have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey as In re: Allergan Generic Drug Pricing Securities Litigation .

Approximately 92 cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois along with one other pending in s tate court. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. Approximately ninety-eight percent of these pending cases, plus other unfiled claims, are subject to confidential settlement agreements or agreements-in-principle and are expected to be dismissed with prejudice. In 2018, a qui tam lawsuit, U.S. ex rel. Silbersher v. Allergan Inc., et al. , was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against several Allergan entities and others, alleging that their conduct before the U.S. Patent Office resulted in false claims for payment being made to federal and state healthcare payors for Namenda XR and Namzaric. The plaintiff-relator seeks damages and attorneys' fees under the federal False Claims Act and state law analogues. The federal government and state governments declined to intervene in the lawsuit. Intellectual Property Litigation Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ibrutinib capsules (a drug Pharmacyclics sells under the trademark Imbruvica). In February 2018 a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Sandoz Inc. and Lek Pharmaceuticals D.D. In the case, Pharmacyclics alleges the defendants' proposed generic ibrutinib product infringes certain Pharmacyclics patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Janssen Biotech, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Pharmacyclics concerning the development and marketing of Imbruvica, is the co-plaintiff in this suit. Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ibrutinib tablets (a drug Pharmacyclics sells under the trademark Imbruvica).

Allergan alleges defendants' proposed generic cariprazine products infringe certain patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Gedeon Richter Plc, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Allergan concerning the development and marketing of Vraylar, is the co-plaintiff in this suit. In January 2019, Allergan, Inc. and Allergan plc (now Allergan Limited) and Medytox Inc. (collectively, ""Complainants"") filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) against Daewoong Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Daewoong Co., Ltd., and Evolus Inc. (collectively, ""Respondents"") requesting the ITC commence an investigation regarding the importation into the United States of Respondents' botulinum neurotoxin products, including Jeuveau, which Complainants assert were developed using Medytox's trade secrets. Complainants seek permanent exclusion and cease and desist orders covering Respondents' products, including Jeuveau. In July 2020, the administrative law judge issued an initial ruling in favor of Allergan and Medytox. In December 2020, the full Commission affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part, the initial ruling. In August 2020, BTL Industries, Inc. (BTL) filed an ITC action against Allergan USA, Inc., Allergan Limited, Allergan, Inc., Zeltiq Aesthetics, Inc., Zeltiq Ireland Unlimited Company, and Zimmer Medizinsysteme GmbH, for patent infringement alleging that the CoolTone and CoolSculpting devices infringe its patents and seeking an exclusion order preventing importation of the devices and any components used to make or use the devices. 2020 Form 10-K | 92 Note 16 Segment and Geographic Area Information AbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 2020 Form 10-K | 96 Sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Revenue Recognition,” the Company established provisions for sales rebates in the same period the related product is sold. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $7,188 million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of which were for rebates provided to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to establish these sales rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based upon the identification of the products subject to a rebate, the applicable price and rebate terms and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment of the rebate. Auditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions included the estimated inventory in the distribution channel, which impacts the lag time between the sale to the customer and payment of the rebate, and the final payer related to product sales, which impacts the applicable price and rebate terms. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information to estimate product in the distribution channels, payer mix, prescription volumes and historical experience. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. The testing was inclusive of management’s controls to evaluate the accuracy of its reserve judgments to actual rebates paid, rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare, and managed care programs, our audit procedures included, among others, understanding and evaluating the significant assumptions and underlying data used in management’s calculations. Our testing of significant assumptions included corroboration to external data sources. We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions considering industry and economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performed analytical procedures, based on internal and external data sources, to evaluate the completeness of the reserves. For Medicaid, we involved a specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company’s calculation methodologies with applicable government regulations and policy. Valuation of contingent consideration Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Business Combinations” and in Note 11 under the caption “Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures,” the Company recognized contingent consideration liabilities at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date in connection with applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recorded within the consolidated statement of earnings in the period of change. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $12,997 million in contingent consideration liabilities, which represented a ‘Level 3’ fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value and the use of management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the liabilities. Auditing the valuation of contingent consideration liabilities was complex and required significant auditor judgment due to the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model and the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions required to estimate the fair value of contingent royalty payments. In particular, the fair value measurement was sensitive to the significant assumptions underlying the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Management utilized its expertise within the industry, including commercial dynamics, trends and utilization, as well as knowledge of clinical development and regulatory approval processes to determine certain of these assumptions. 97 | 2020 Form 10-K How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s contingent consideration liabilities process including, among others, management’s process to establish the significant assumptions and measure the liability. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the determination of fair value. The testing was inclusive of key management review controls to monitor and evaluate clinical development of the acquired products and estimated future sales, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the terms of the executed agreement, assessing the Monte Carlo simulation model used and testing the key contractual inputs and significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the assumptions and judgments considering observable industry and economic trends and standards, external data sources and regulatory factors. Estimated amounts of future sales were evaluated for reasonableness in relation to internal and external analyses, clinical development progress and timelines, probability of success benchmarks, and regulatory notices. Our procedures included evaluating the data sources used by management in determining its assumptions and, where necessary, included an evaluation of available information that either corroborated or contradicted management’s conclusions. We involved a valuation specialist to assess the Company’s Monte Carlo simulation model and to perform corroborative fair value calculations. Accounting for Allergan plc acquisition – Valuation of intangible assets Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements”, the Company completed the acquisition of Allergan plc (“Allergan”) on May 8, 2020 for approximately $64,084 million. The Company measured the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value, which resulted in the recognition of $69,080 million of intangible assets, comprised of $67,330 million of developed product rights and $1,750 million of in-process research and development (“IPR&D”). Auditing the valuation of intangible assets was complex and required significant auditor judgment due to the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions required to estimate the fair value of the identified intangible assets. In particular, the fair value measurement was sensitive to management’s forecasts of net revenues, including growth rates used to estimate future net cash flows for acquired aesthetics and recently launched products. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting for acquisitions including, among others, management’s process to establish the significant assumptions used in determining the fair values of intangible assets. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the determination of estimated future net revenues, the determination of future net cash flows, estimated growth rates, and review of the valuation model. To test the estimated fair value of intangible assets, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the terms of the executed agreement, evaluating the valuation methods used, and testing the significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the assumptions and judgments considering observable industry and economic trends and standards, external data sources, and historical product trends, including those of comparable products, to the extent applicable. Estimated future net revenues were evaluated for reasonableness against internal and external analyses, including analyst expectations, industry trends, and market trends. Our procedures included evaluating the data sources used by management in determining its assumptions and, where necessary, included an evaluation of available information that either corroborated or contradicted management’s conclusions. We involved a valuation specialist to assess the valuation model and to perform corroborative fair value calculations. 2020 Form 10-K | 98 Accounting for Allergan plc acquisition – Unrecognized tax benefits Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 14 under the caption “Income Taxes,” as part of the acquisition of Allergan plc, the Company recorded $2,674 million of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions. The Company applied judgment in evaluating the completeness of unrecognized tax benefits assumed as of the acquisition date. Some of the more significant judgments inherent in the Company’s evaluation of assumed uncertain tax positions included whether a tax position’s technical merits were more-likely-than-not to be sustained, including consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. Auditing the Company’s analysis and accounting for uncertain tax positions was complex due to the interpretation of tax laws and legal rulings in multiple tax paying jurisdictions and required significant judgment in determining whether an assumed tax position’s technical merits were more-likely-than-not to be sustained. In particular, each assumed unrecognized tax benefit involved unique facts and circumstances and multiple potential outcomes that were evaluated, with many uncertainties around initial recognition, including regulatory changes, litigation and examination activity. Management utilized outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, in its evaluation. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting for acquisitions including, among others, management’s process to evaluate the completeness and estimation of unrecognized tax benefits. This included testing controls over management’s determination of whether an assumed tax position’s technical merits were more-likely-than-not to be sustained and, if so, recognizing the estimated amount of qualified tax benefit. We also obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant fair value assumptions and unrecognized tax benefits was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the completeness and recognition of unrecognized tax benefits, our audit procedures included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the unrecognized tax benefits. Testing management’s process included assessing management’s interpretation of the unique facts, circumstances and related tax laws and legal rulings in each tax paying jurisdiction, examining whether the technical merits of each tax position were more-likely-than-not to be sustained, and evaluating the recognition of the amount of qualified tax benefit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the completeness and recognition of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, including consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. Chicago, Illinois February 19, 2021 99 | 2020 Form 10-K ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Robert A. Michael, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2020. Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls. AbbVie's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie's disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Management of AbbVie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that AbbVie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.

The report of AbbVie's independent registered public accounting firm related to its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is included below. 2020 Form 10-K | 100 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AbbVie Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 19, 2021 101 | 2020 Form 10-K ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS Overview AbbVie (1) is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie develops and markets advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; pain associated with endometriosis; as well as other serious health conditions. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines in clinical development across such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health. In June 2019, AbbVie announced that it entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which AbbVie will acquire Allergan plc (Allergan). Allergan is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing branded pharmaceutical, device, biologic, surgical and regenerative medicine products for patients around the world. Allergan markets a portfolio of brands and products primarily focused on key therapeutic areas including aesthetics, eye care, neuroscience, gastroenterology and women's health. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the proposed acquisition. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. Segments AbbVie operates in one business segment—pharmaceutical products. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the sales information related to HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA and MAVYRET included under Item 7 , "" Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ."" Products AbbVie's portfolio of products includes a broad line of therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. Immunology products. AbbVie maintains an extensive immunology portfolio across rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology. AbbVie's immunology products address unmet needs for patients with autoimmune diseases. These products are: HUMIRA. HUMIRA (adalimumab) is a biologic therapy administered as a subcutaneous injection. It is approved to treat the following autoimmune diseases in the United States, Canada and Mexico (collectively, North America) and in the European Union: Condition Principal Markets Rheumatoid arthritis (moderate to severe) North America, European Union Psoriatic arthritis North America, European Union Ankylosing spondylitis North America, European Union Adult Crohn's disease (moderate to severe) North America, European Union Plaque psoriasis (moderate to severe chronic) North America, European Union Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (moderate to severe polyarticular) North America, European Union Ulcerative colitis (moderate to severe) North America, European Union Axial spondyloarthropathy European Union Pediatric Crohn's disease (moderate to severe) North America, European Union Hidradenitis Suppurativa (moderate to severe) North America, European Union Pediatric enthesitis-related arthritis European Union Non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis North America, European Union _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the terms ""AbbVie"" or ""the company"" refer to AbbVie Inc., a Delaware corporation, or AbbVie Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. 2019 Form 10-K | 1 HUMIRA is also approved in Japan for the treatment of intestinal Behçet's disease. HUMIRA is sold in numerous other markets worldwide, including Japan, China, Brazil and Australia, and accounted for approximately 58% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2019 . SKYRIZI. SKYRIZI (risankizumab) is an interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor that selectively blocks IL-23 by binding to its p19 subunit. It is a biologic therapy administered as a quarterly subcutaneous injection following an induction dose. SKYRIZI is approved in the United States, Canada and the European Union and is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. In Japan, SKYRIZI is approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have an inadequate response to conventional therapies. RINVOQ . RINVOQ (upadacitinib) is a once-daily oral selective and reversible JAK inhibitor and is approved in the United States, Canada and the European Union. RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. Oncology products. AbbVie’s oncology products target some of the most complex and difficult-to-treat cancers. These products are: IMBRUVICA. IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) is an oral, once-daily therapy that inhibits a protein called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). IMBRUVICA was one of the first medicines to receive a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval after being granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation and is one of the few therapies to receive four separate designations. IMBRUVICA currently is approved for the treatment of adult patients with: • Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and CLL/SLL with 17p deletion; • Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy*; • Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM); • Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy*; and • Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. _______________________________________________________________________________ * Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO. VENCLEXTA (venetoclax) is a BCL-2 inhibitor used to treat hematological malignancies. VENCLEXTA is approved by the FDA for adults with CLL or SLL. In addition, VENCLEXTA is approved in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine to treat adults with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are 75 years of age or older or have other medical conditions that prevent the use of standard chemotherapy. VENCLYXTO is approved in Europe for CLL in combination with rituximab in patients who have received at least one previous treatment. Virology Products. AbbVie's virology products address unmet needs for patients living with HCV and HIV. HCV products. AbbVie's HCV products are: MAVYRET/MAVIRET. MAVYRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) is approved in the United States and European Union (MAVIRET) for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A). It is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, who previously have been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. It is an 8-week, pan-genotypic treatment for patients without cirrhosis and following the EXPEDITION-8 study, also in patients with compensated cirrhosis who are new to treatment. MAVIRET is now also indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1-6 in children between 12-18 years. VIEKIRA PAK AND TECHNIVIE. VIEKIRA PAK (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir tablets; dasabuvir tablets) is an all-oral, short-course, interferon-free therapy, with or without ribavirin, for the treatment of adult patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV, including those with compensated cirrhosis. In Europe, VIEKIRA PAK is marketed as VIEKIRAX + EXVIERA and is approved for use in patients with genotype 1 and genotype 4 HCV. AbbVie's TECHNIVIE (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and 2 | 2019 Form 10-K ritonavir) is FDA-approved for use in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of adults with genotype 4 HCV infection in the United States. The use of VIEKIRA in the United States, Europe and Japan is currently limited given the significant use of pangenotypic regimens, including MAVIRET. Additional Virology products. AbbVie's additional virology products include: SYNAGIS. SYNAGIS (palivizumab) is a product marketed by AbbVie outside of the United States that protects at-risk infants from severe respiratory disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). KALETRA. KALETRA (lopinavir/ritonavir), which is also marketed as ALUVIA in emerging markets, is a prescription anti-HIV-1 medicine that contains two protease inhibitors: lopinavir and ritonavir. KALETRA is used with other anti-HIV-1 medications as a treatment that maintains viral suppression in people with HIV-1. Metabolics/Hormones products. Metabolic and hormone products target a number of conditions, including testosterone deficiency due to certain underlying conditions, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and hypothyroidism. These products include: CREON. CREON (pancrelipase) is a pancreatic enzyme therapy for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, a condition that occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis and several other conditions. Synthroid. Synthroid (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP) is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism. AndroGel. AndroGel (testosterone gel) is a testosterone replacement therapy for males diagnosed with symptomatic low testosterone due to certain underlying conditions. AbbVie has the rights to sell AndroGel, CREON and Synthroid only in the United States. Endocrinology products. Lupron (leuprolide acetate), which is also marketed as Lucrin and LUPRON DEPOT, is a product for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer, treatment of endometriosis and central precocious puberty and for the preoperative treatment of patients with anemia caused by uterine fibroids. Lupron is approved for daily subcutaneous injection and one-month, three-month, four-month and six-month intramuscular injection. Other products. AbbVie's other products include: ORILISSA. ORILISSA (elagolix) is the first and only orally-administered, nonpeptide small molecule gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist specifically developed for women with moderate to severe endometriosis pain. The FDA approved ORILISSA under priority review. It represents the first FDA-approved oral treatment for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in over a decade. ORILISSA inhibits endogenous GnRH signaling by binding competitively to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. Administration results in dose-dependent suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, leading to decreased blood concentrations of ovarian sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone. Outside the United States, ORILISSA is also launched in Canada and Puerto Rico. Duopa and Duodopa (carbidopa and levodopa). AbbVie's levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease is marketed as Duopa in the United States and as Duodopa outside of the United States. Sevoflurane. Sevoflurane (sold under the trademarks Ultane and Sevorane) is an anesthesia product that AbbVie sells worldwide for human use. Marketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities AbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and distribute its products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand of products by physicians, key opinion leaders and other health care providers. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie also markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States all of the company's products must be sold pursuant to a prescription. Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its marketing efforts on key opinion leaders, payers, physicians and country regulatory bodies. AbbVie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality, AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors. 2019 Form 10-K | 3 In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. In 2019 , three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States . No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 42% of AbbVie's 2019 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. These wholesalers purchase product from AbbVie under standard terms and conditions of sale. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business. Competition The markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, HUMIRA competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and AbbVie's virology products compete with other available HCV treatment options. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVie’s competitors could cause revenues for AbbVie’s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases. Biosimilars. Competition for AbbVie’s biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as “biosimilars.” Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional (small molecule) medications, and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products. HUMIRA is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, and AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products. In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and implementing regulations. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the Public Health Service Act, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is complex. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is ""highly similar"" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies. Furthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be ""interchangeable"" will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to substantial uncertainty. Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity Generally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVie’s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a “patent term restoration,” for 4 | 2019 Form 10-K patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the Public Health Service Act are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration. Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length, and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity. Applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods. Biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products. AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications. These patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2020 to the late 2030s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVie’s business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark HUMIRA), are material in relation to the company’s business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in October 2018 in the majority of European Union countries. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. AbbVie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures. Under the agreements, the license in the United States will begin in 2023 and the license in Europe began in 2018. In addition, the following patents, licenses, and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark IMBRUVICA) and those related to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (which are sold under the trademarks MAVYRET and MAVIRET). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027. The United States composition of matter patents covering glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are expected to expire in 2032. AbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVie’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently 2019 Form 10-K | 5 discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVie’s employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements In addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-to-acquire agreements, licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, and joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs, and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5 , "" Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements — Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity ,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" Third Party Agreements AbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption. AbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5 , "" Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements — Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity ,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" Sources and Availability of Raw Materials AbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. AbbVie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages that impacted fulfillment of product demand. Research and Development Activities AbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVie’s existing portfolio. The research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases: • Phase 1—involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and potential dosing. • Phase 2—tests the drug's efficacy against the disease in a relatively small group of patients. • Phase 3—tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria. The clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar government agencies outside the United States. The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. 6 | 2019 Form 10-K The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication. In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug. Regulation—Discovery and Clinical Development United States. Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Even if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be included in the NDA or BLA and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Outside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. In Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application. The regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process. Some countries also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans). Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing The manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory 2019 Form 10-K | 7 procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. In addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie's business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight, investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. AbbVie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Political and budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie's products for the foreseeable future. United States. Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect AbbVie's business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities. In the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part D. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 50% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or ""donut hole."" The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and 8 | 2019 Form 10-K teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. AbbVie expects debate to continue during 2020 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services. AbbVie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which AbbVie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. European Union. The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products. Most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems. Japan. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available. Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Since AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action. Environmental Matters AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. AbbVie's capital expenditures for pollution control in 2019 were approximately $29 million and operating expenditures were approximately $34 million . In 2020 , capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately $5 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately $35 million . Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Some of these locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, and AbbVie has become a party to these investigations and remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which have been transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, AbbVie believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. 2019 Form 10-K | 9 Employees AbbVie employed approximately 30,000 persons as of January 31, 2020 . Outside the United States, some of AbbVie's employees are represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees. Internet Information Copies of AbbVie's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after AbbVie electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). AbbVie's corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of AbbVie's audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee and public policy committee are all available on AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ). ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to AbbVie's business, risks related to AbbVie's proposed acquisition of Allergan (the ""Acquisition"") and the combined company upon completion of the Acquisition, and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline. Risks Related to AbbVie's Business The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products. As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition. AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1 , "" Business —Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity"" and Item 7 , "" Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Results of Operations,"" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3 , "" Legal Proceedings ."" The United States composition of matter patent for HUMIRA, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $19.2 billion in 2019 , expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018. 10 | 2019 Form 10-K AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. Third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition. Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Any significant event that adversely affects HUMIRA revenues could have a material and negative impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. HUMIRA accounted for approximately 58% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2019 . Any significant event that adversely affects HUMIRA's revenues could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection for HUMIRA (as described further in “— The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie’s future revenues and operating earnings ” above), the commercialization of biosimilars of HUMIRA, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of HUMIRA for any reason. AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, 2019 Form 10-K | 11 including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's future results of operations. Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer. A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products. AbbVie depends on alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics—including HUMIRA—could adversely impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie's biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the United States and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved. In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with AbbVie’s biologic products, including HUMIRA. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVie’s biologic products, AbbVie’s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of AbbVie’s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant 12 | 2019 Form 10-K exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products. New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, HUMIRA competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and AbbVie’s virology products compete with other available hepatitis C treatment options. These competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie’s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, virology/liver disease, oncology and neuroscience. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than AbbVie’s products, and this could negatively impact AbbVie’s business and results of operations. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers. The failure of these single-source suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve AbbVie's use of such alternatives. AbbVie does, however, carry business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier. Significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial condition. Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities and regulatory action could be taken 2019 Form 10-K | 13 by such regulatory authorities. Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of AbbVie's products. New data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's products. AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product in question, lower income and exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. AbbVie is also the subject of other claims, legal proceedings and investigations in the ordinary course of business, which relate to the intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters. Adverse outcomes in such claims, legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect AbbVie’s business and results of operations. AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""Business—Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future. AbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and United States federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, contribute to pricing pressures. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures. In numerous major markets worldwide, the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings. Rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. 14 | 2019 Form 10-K AbbVie is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. AbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in Item 1 , "" Business —Regulation—Discovery and Clinical Development."" The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs. In addition, AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to AbbVie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls or seizures of AbbVie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of AbbVie's or its suppliers' facilities while AbbVie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt AbbVie's business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. The health care industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement, rebates, price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse. In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require AbbVie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt AbbVie's business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. AbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Net revenues outside of the United States made up approximately 28% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2019 . The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States include: • fluctuations in currency exchange rates; • changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs; • multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its products; • differing local product preferences and product requirements; • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; • international trade disruptions or disputes, including in connection with the ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China; • difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations; • differing labor regulations; • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; 2019 Form 10-K | 15 • political and economic instability, including the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union; • sovereign debt issues; • price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action; • inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates; • potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries, including in Europe and Latin America; and • potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and profitability. If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. AbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected. AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. AbbVie may pursue acquisitions (such as the pending acquisition of Allergan), technology licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Additionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate. AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties. In 2019 , three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States . If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. 16 | 2019 Form 10-K AbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. The amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow AbbVie's business. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase. In addition, AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt. AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. AbbVie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes. For example, it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions. AbbVie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If AbbVie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, AbbVie may be unable to fund its expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect AbbVie's business. If AbbVie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may result in the failure of critical business operations or may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business. Such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from AbbVie’s or third-party providers’ databases or IT systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business harm to AbbVie and potentially substantial remediation costs. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could affect AbbVie’s ability to successfully develop and commercialize products. AbbVie’s success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical R&D, governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. AbbVie cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including: • changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, data privacy laws and environmental laws; • differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits, stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount; • changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts; 2019 Form 10-K | 17 • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts; • changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie; and • changes in business, economic and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups. Risks Related to the Acquisition and the Combined Company Upon Completion of the Acquisition The pending acquisition of Allergan may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits. Consummation of the Acquisition is conditioned on, among other things, obtaining necessary governmental and regulatory approvals. If any of the conditions to the Acquisition is not satisfied, it could delay or prevent the Acquisition from occurring, which could negatively impact AbbVie’s share price and future business and financial results. Further, as a condition to their approval of the Acquisition, agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the AbbVie’s business after the closing. These requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the consummation of the Acquisition or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction. In addition, changes in laws and regulations, including Irish legislation implementing a tax increase payable upon completion of the Acquisition, could adversely impact AbbVie’s post-Acquisition profitability and financial results. Following the Acquisition, AbbVie may not realize the Acquisition’s intended benefits within the expected timeframe or at all. The indebtedness of the combined company following the consummation of the Acquisition will be substantially greater than AbbVie’s indebtedness on a standalone basis and greater than the combined indebtedness of AbbVie and Allergan prior to the announcement of the acquisition. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect the combined company’s business flexibility and increase its borrowing costs. AbbVie expects that the cash consideration due to Allergan’s shareholders under the transaction agreement and related fees and expenses will be approximately $41 billion. In addition to using cash on hand, AbbVie has incurred significant Acquisition-related debt financing, including unsecured term loans and senior notes. For more information, see Note 10 “ Debt, Credit Facilities and Commitments and Contingencies ,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 , “ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .” AbbVie also intends to assume all the existing indebtedness of Allergan and its subsidiaries. AbbVie’s substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt to equity ratio following the consummation of the Acquisition may have the effect of, among other things, reducing its flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, lowering its credit ratings, increasing its borrowing costs and/or requiring it to reduce or delay investments, strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures or to seek additional capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness. Risks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock AbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock. Although AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5 , "" Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ."" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future. An AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in the future. In the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions 18 | 2019 Form 10-K (including AbbVie's pending acquisition of Allergan), or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits plans. In addition, AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes AbbVie to issue, without the approval of AbbVie's stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over AbbVie's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as AbbVie's board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. Certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading price of AbbVie's common stock. AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: • the inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting; • the division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term; • a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause; • the ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on AbbVie's board of directors; and • the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80% of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock. AbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 . This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; pain associated with endometriosis; as well as other serious health conditions. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines in clinical development across such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 30,000 employees. AbbVie operates in one business segment—pharmaceutical products. On June 25, 2019, AbbVie announced that it entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which AbbVie will acquire Allergan plc (Allergan). See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the proposed acquisition. 2019 Financial Results AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2019 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $33.3 billion , operating earnings of $13.0 billion , diluted earnings per share of $5.28 and cash flows from operations of $13.3 billion . Worldwide net revenues grew by 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by revenue growth related to IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA as well as the continued strength of HUMIRA in the U.S. and newly launched immunology assets SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, offset by international HUMIRA biosimilar competition. Diluted earnings per share in 2019 was $5.28 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $3.2 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; (ii) $1.3 billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (iii) a Stemcentrx-related impairment charge of $823 million net of the related fair value adjustment to contingent consideration liabilities; (iv) $364 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); and (v) $338 million of expenses related to the proposed Allergan acquisition. These costs were partially offset by the following after-tax benefits: (i) $414 million from litigation matters primarily due to the settlement of an intellectual property dispute with a third party ; (ii) $400 million due to the favorable resolution of various tax positions; and (iii) $297 million from an amended and restated license agreement between AbbVie and Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Reata). Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s emerging pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s on-market brands. In November 2019 , AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.18 per share of common stock payable in February 2020 . This reflects an increase of approximately 10.3% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.07 per share of common stock. 26 | 2019 Form 10-K 2020 Strategic Objectives AbbVie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) growing revenues by diversifying revenue streams, ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches and driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market; (ii) continuing to invest and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iii) expanding operating margins; and (iv) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing incremental debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months. AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through: • Completion and successful integration of the proposed Allergan acquisition. • Hematologic oncology revenue growth from both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. • Immunology revenue growth driven by successful commercial launches of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, as well as HUMIRA U.S. sales growth. • Effective management of HUMIRA international biosimilar erosion. • The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2020 . These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7 . AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. The combination of AbbVie and Allergan will create a diverse entity with leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, women's health, eye care and virology. AbbVie's existing product portfolio and pipeline will be enhanced with numerous Allergan assets and Allergan's product portfolio will benefit from AbbVie's commercial strength, expertise and international infrastructure. Research and Development Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline currently includes approximately 60 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis and women's health. Of these programs, approximately 30 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 development to Phase 3 development as well as developments in significant Phase 3 and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs in the next 12 months. Significant Programs and Developments Immunology RINVOQ • In February 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for priority review AbbVie's New Drug Application (NDA) for upadacitinib, an investigational oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). • In February 2019, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in subjects with giant cell arteritis. 2019 Form 10-K | 27 • In August 2019, the FDA approved RINVOQ (upadacitinib) for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. • In October 2019, AbbVie announced top-line results from its first Phase 3 clinical trial of RINVOQ in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Results from the SELECT-PsA 2 study, which evaluated RINVOQ versus placebo in patients who did not adequately respond to treatment with one or more biologic DMARDs, showed that both doses of RINVOQ (15 mg and 30 mg) met the primary and key secondary endpoints at week 12. The safety profile was consistent with that of previous studies across indications, with no new safety risks detected. • In November 2019, AbbVie announced data from the Phase 2/3 SELECT-AXIS 1 trial in which twice as many adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with RINVOQ achieved the primary endpoint at week 14 versus placebo. The safety profile was consistent with that of previous studies across indications, with no new safety risks detected. • In November 2019, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RINVOQ in adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis. • In December 2019, the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for RINVOQ for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more DMARDs. • In February 2020, AbbVie announced top-line results from its second Phase 3 clinical trial of RINVOQ in adult patients with active PsA. Results from the SELECT-PsA 1 study, which evaluated RINVOQ versus placebo in patients who did not adequately respond to treatment with one or more non-biologic DMARDs, showed that both doses of RINVOQ (15 mg and 30 mg) met the primary and key secondary endpoints. The safety profile was consistent with that of previous studies across indications, with no new safety risks detected. SKYRIZI • In March 2019, AbbVie initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab, an investigational interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, in subjects with psoriatic arthritis. • In April 2019, the FDA approved SKYRIZI (risankizumab) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. • In April 2019, the EC granted marketing authorization for SKYRIZI for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. Oncology IMBRUVICA • In January 2019, the FDA approved IMBRUVICA, in combination with GAZYVA (obinutuzumab), for adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). • In June 2019, AbbVie announced results from the Phase 3 CLL12 trial, evaluating IMBRUVICA in patients with previously untreated CLL, which demonstrated that IMBRUVICA significantly improved event- and progression-free survival. • In November 2019, AbbVie submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab for the first-line treatment of younger patients with CLL or SLL. VENCLEXTA • In March 2019, AbbVie announced that the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on all clinical trials evaluating VENCLEXTA for the investigational treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). The partial clinical hold followed a review of data from the ongoing Phase 3 BELLINI trial, a study in relapsed/refractory MM, in which a higher proportion of deaths was observed in the VENCLEXTA arm compared to the control arm of the trial. In June 2019, AbbVie announced that the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold placed on the Phase 3 CANOVA trial, evaluating VENCLEXTA for the investigational treatment of relapsed/refractory MM positive for the translocation (11;14) abnormality, based upon agreement on revisions to the CANOVA study protocol, including new risk mitigation measures, protocol-specified guidelines and updated futility criteria. This action does not impact any of the approved indications for VENCLEXTA, such as CLL or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 28 | 2019 Form 10-K • In May 2019, the FDA approved VENCLEXTA, in combination with obinutuzumab, for adult patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL. The approval was based on data from the Phase 3 CLL14 trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA plus obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with CLL, which demonstrated that VENCLEXTA plus obinutuzumab prolonged progression-free survival and achieved higher rates of complete response and minimal residual disease-negativity compared to commonly used standard of care obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. • In January 2020, AbbVie announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted a positive opinion for VENCLYXTO in combination with obinutuzumab for patients with previously untreated CLL. Depatux-M • In May 2019, AbbVie announced the decision to discontinue the Phase 3 INTELLANCE-1 study of depatuxizumab mafodotin (Depatux-M, previously known as ABT-414) in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, whose tumors have EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) amplification, at an interim analysis. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping enrollment in INTELLANCE-1 due to lack of survival benefit for patients receiving Depatux-M compared with placebo when added to the standard regimen of radiation and temozolomide. Enrollment has been halted in all ongoing Depatux-M studies. Veliparib • In July 2019, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 BROCADE3 study evaluating veliparib, an investigational, oral poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with HER2 negative germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer. • In July 2019, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 VELIA study, conducted in collaboration with the GOG Foundation, Inc., evaluating veliparib with carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by veliparib maintenance therapy met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, regardless of biomarker status. Rova-T • In August 2019, AbbVie announced the decision to terminate the MERU trial, a Phase 3 study evaluating rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) as a first-line maintenance therapy for advanced small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended terminating the study after results demonstrated no survival benefit at a pre-planned interim analysis for patients receiving Rova-T as compared with placebo. With the closing of the MERU trial, AbbVie announced the termination of the Rova-T research and development program. Virology/Liver Disease • In August 2019, the EC granted marketing authorization for MAVIRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) to shorten the once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-naïve, compensated cirrhotic, chronic HCV patients with genotype (GT)1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 infection. • In September 2019, the FDA approved MAVYRET (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) to shorten the once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-naïve, compensated cirrhotic, chronic HCV patients across all genotypes (GT1-6). • In January 2020, AbbVie announced that the CHMP of the EMA has recommended a change to the marketing authorization for MAVIRET to shorten once-daily treatment duration from 12 to 8 weeks in treatment-naïve, compensated cirrhotic, chronic HCV patients with GT 3 infection. Neuroscience • In May 2019, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABBV-951, a subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system, in subjects with Parkinson's disease. • In July 2019, AbbVie announced the decision to discontinue the Phase 2 ARISE study evaluating ABBV-8E12, an investigational anti-tau antibody, in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, after an Independent Data 2019 Form 10-K | 29 Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial for futility after the trial showed that ABBV-8E12 did not provide efficacy. Other • In July 2019, AbbVie submitted an NDA to the FDA for elagolix in combination with estradiol/norethindrone acetate (E2/NETA) daily add-back therapy for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Revenues The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

Global HUMIRA sales decreased 3% in 2019 and increased 7% in 2018 . The sales decrease in 2019 was primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets, partially offset by market growth across therapeutic categories. The sales increase in 2018 was primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies as well as favorable pricing in certain geographies. In the United States, HUMIRA sales increased 9% in 2019 and 11% in 2018 . The sales increases in 2019 and 2018 were primarily driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing. Internationally, HUMIRA revenues decreased 28% in 2019 and increased 1% in 2018 . The sales decrease in 2019 was primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in Europe following the expiration of the European Union composition of matter patent for adalimumab in October 2018. The sales increase in 2018 was primarily driven by market growth across indications partially offset by direct biosimilar competition. Biosimilar competition for HUMIRA is not expected in the United States until 2023. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies intended to further differentiate HUMIRA from competing products and add to the sustainability of HUMIRA. Net revenues for SKYRIZI were $355 million in 2019 following the April 2019 regulatory approvals for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Net revenues for RINVOQ were $47 million in 2019 following the August 2019 FDA approval for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Net revenues for IMBRUVICA represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of IMBRUVICA profit. AbbVie's global IMBRUVICA revenues increased 30% in 2019 and 39% in 2018 as a result of continued penetration of IMBRUVICA for patients with CLL as well as favorable pricing. Net revenues for VENCLEXTA increased by more than 100% in 2019 and 2018 primarily due to market share gains following additional regulatory approvals of VENCLEXTA for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL and first-line AML in 2018 and first-line CLL in 2019. Global MAVYRET sales decreased by 15% in 2019 primarily driven by lower patient volumes in certain international markets and competitive dynamics in the U.S. Global MAVYRET sales increased more than 100% in 2018 as a result of market share gains following the FDA and EMA approvals of MAVYRET in the second half of 2017 as well as further geographic expansion. Global VIEKIRA sales decreased by 78% in 2019 and 76% in 2018 primarily due to lower market share following the launch of MAVYRET. Net revenues for Creon increased 12% in 2019 and 12% in 2018 , primarily driven by continued market growth and favorable pricing. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market. Net revenues for Duodopa increased 12% in 2019 and 18% in 2018 , primarily driven by increased market penetration. Gross Margin Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 Gross margin $ 25,827 $ 25,035 $ 21,174 3 % 18 % as a percent of net revenues 78 % 76 % 75 % Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2019 increased from 2018 primarily due to the full year effect of the expiration of HUMIRA royalties, partially offset by the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement and unfavorable impact from higher intangible asset amortization. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to the expiration of HUMIRA royalties and a 2017 intangible asset impairment charge of $354 million partially offset by the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement. 32 | 2019 Form 10-K Selling, General and Administrative Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 Selling, general and administrative $ 6,942 $ 7,399 $ 6,295 (6 )% 18 % as a percent of net revenues 21 % 23 % 22 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2019 decreased from 2018 primarily due to the favorable impacts of international HUMIRA expense reductions and lower litigation reserve charges that decreased by $326 million . This favorability was partially offset by new product launch expenses, higher restructuring charges and $103 million of transaction expenses associated with the proposed Allergan transaction. Additionally, SG&A expenses in 2018 included non-recurring philanthropic contributions of $350 million to certain U.S. not-for-profit organizations. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to new product launch expenses and non-recurring philanthropic contributions to certain U.S. not-for-profit organizations partially offset by continued leverage from revenue growth. Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 Research and development $ 6,407 $ 10,329 $ 5,007 (38 )% >100% as a percent of net revenues 19 % 32 % 18 % Acquired in-process research and development $ 385 $ 424 $ 327 (9 )% 30 % Research and Development (R&D) expenses decreased in 2019 and increased in 2018 principally due to impairment charges related to IPR&D acquired as part of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition. In 2019, the company recorded a $1.0 billion intangible asset impairment charge which represented the remaining value of the IPR&D acquired following the decision to terminate the Rova-T R&D program. In 2018, the company recorded a $5.1 billion intangible asset impairment charge following the decision to stop enrollment in the TAHOE trial, which lowered the probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets obtained in the acquisition. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these impairment charges. Acquired IPR&D expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2019 or 2018. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2017 included a charge of $205 million as a result of entering into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Alector agreement. Other Operating Expenses and Income Other operating income in 2019 included $550 million of income from a legal settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with a third party and $330 million of income related to an amended and restated license agreement between AbbVie and Reata . See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Reata agreement. Other operating expenses in 2018 included a $500 million charge related to the extension of the previously announced Calico collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Calico agreement. 2019 Form 10-K | 33 Other Non-Operating Expenses years ended December 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Interest expense $ 1,784 $ 1,348 $ 1,150 Interest income (275 ) (204 ) (146 ) Interest expense, net $ 1,509 $ 1,144 $ 1,004 Net foreign exchange loss $ 42 $ 24 $ 348 Other expense, net 3,006 18 466 Interest expense in 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to $363 million of incremental interest and debt issuance costs associated with financing the proposed acquisition of Allergan, as well as the unfavorable impact of higher interest rates on the company's debt obligations. Interest expense in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of higher interest rates on the company's debt obligations and a higher average outstanding debt balance during 2018 . Interest income in 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to a higher average cash and cash equivalents balance during 2019, partially offset by decreased investments in debt securities. Interest income in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher interest rates. Net foreign exchange loss in 2017 included $316 million of historical currency translation losses that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Other expense, net included charges related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities of $3.1 billion in 2019 , $49 million in 2018 and $626 million in 2017 . The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development and other market-based factors. In 2019 , the Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) contingent consideration liability increased due to higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales, declining interest rates and passage of time. The higher probabilities of success primarily resulted from the April 2019 regulatory approvals of SKYRIZI for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. These changes were partially offset by a $91 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T R&D program during the third quarter of 2019. In 2018 , the BI contingent consideration liability increased due to the passage of time and higher estimated future sales partially offset by the effect of rising interest rates. This increase in the BI contingent consideration liability was primarily offset by a $428 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018 due to a reduction in probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage Stemcentrx assets. In 2017 , the change in fair value represented mainly higher probabilities of success, the passage of time and declining interest rates. Other expense, net for 2017 also included realized gains on available-for-sale investment securities of $90 million. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was 6% in 2019 , negative 9% in 2018 and 31% in 2017 . The effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions and business development activities. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2019 over the prior year was principally due to the timing of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) related to the earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. The increase is also attributable to changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings, including a change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. These increases were partially offset by the favorable resolution of various tax positions in the current year. The effective tax rate for 2018 also included the effects of Stemcentrx intangible impairment related expenses. The effective tax rate in 2017 included tax expense of $4.5 billion on the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a $3.6 billion net tax benefit for the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Act and foreign tax law changes. 34 | 2019 Form 10-K The Act significantly changed the U.S. corporate tax system. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and created a territorial tax system that included new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Act. FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Cash flows from: Operating activities $ 13,324 $ 13,427 $ 9,960 Investing activities 596 (1,006 ) (274 ) Financing activities 18,708 (14,396 ) (5,512 ) Operating cash flows in 2019 decreased slightly from 2018 primarily due to higher payments for income taxes offset by improved results of operations resulting from an increase in operating earnings. Operating cash flows in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to improved results of operations from revenue growth and a decrease in income tax payments. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie’s contributions to its defined benefit plans of $727 million in 2019 , $873 million in 2018 and $246 million in 2017 . Investing cash flows in 2019 included net sales and maturities of investments totaling $2.1 billion resulting from the sale of substantially all of the company's investments in debt securities, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.1 billion and capital expenditures of $552 million . Investing cash flows in 2018 included payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $736 million and capital expenditures of $638 million , partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $368 million . Investing cash flows in 2017 included capital expenditures of $529 million and payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $308 million , partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $563 million . Financing cash flows in 2019 included the issuance of $30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate and fixed rate unsecured senior notes at maturities ranging from 18 months to 30 years . AbbVie expects to use the net proceeds of $29.8 billion to fund a portion of the aggregate cash consideration due to Allergan shareholders in connection with the proposed acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. Pending the consummation of the proposed Allergan acquisition, the net proceeds from the offering are permitted to be invested temporarily in short-term investments. All of the notes are subject to special mandatory redemption at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if the proposed acquisition of Allergan is not completed by January 30, 2021 or the company notifies the trustee in respect of the notes that it will not pursue the consummation of the proposed Allergan acquisition. Additionally, financing cash flows in 2019 included the issuance of €1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes which the company used to redeem €1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.38% senior Euro notes that were due to mature in November 2019, as well as the repayment of a $3.0 billion 364 -day term loan credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in June 2019. Financing cash flows in 2018 included proceeds from the issuance of $3.0 billion drawn under the term loan in June 2018. In September 2018, the company issued $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. Of the $5.9 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the company's outstanding three-year term loan credit agreement in September 2018 and $1.0 billion was used to repay the aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior notes at maturity in November 2018. Financing cash flows in 2018 also included the May 2018 repayment of $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 1.80% senior notes at maturity. In 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and there was $699 million outstanding as of December 31, 2018 . AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. Cash dividend payments totaled $6.4 billion in 2019 , $5.6 billion in 2018 and $4.1 billion in 2017 . The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase in the dividend rate. On November 1, 2019 , AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.07 per share to $1.18 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 14, 2020 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2020 . This reflects an increase of approximately 10.3% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's 2019 Form 10-K | 35 debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. On December 13, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million in 2019 and 109 million shares for $10.7 billion in 2018. AbbVie cash-settled $201 million of its December 2018 open market purchases in January 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 . Under previous stock repurchase programs, AbbVie made open market share repurchases of 11 million shares for $1.3 billion in 2018 and 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in 2017. AbbVie cash-settled $285 million of its December 2016 open market purchases in January 2017. In 2019, AbbVie made contingent consideration milestone and royalty payments to BI totaling $234 million following the commercial launch of SKYRIZI in certain geographies. $163 million of these payments were included in financing cash flows and $71 million of the payments were included in operating cash flows. In 2018, AbbVie paid $100 million of contingent consideration to BI related to BLA and MAA acceptance milestones. $78 million of these payments were included in financing cash flows and $22 million of the payments were included in operating cash flows. In 2017, AbbVie paid $305 million of contingent consideration to BI related to a Phase 3 enrollment milestone. $268 million of this milestone was included in financing cash flows and $37 million was included in operating cash flows. In connection with the proposed acquisition of Allergan, on June 25, 2019, AbbVie entered into a $38.0 billion 364-day bridge credit agreement and on July 12, 2019, AbbVie entered into a $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement. The company incurred a total of $242 million of debt issuance costs related to the two agreements. On October 25, 2019, AbbVie commenced offers to exchange any and all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Allergan for up to $15.5 billion aggregate principal amount and €3.7 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes to be issued by AbbVie and cash, subject to conditions including the closing of the proposed acquisition. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In February 2020, the remaining commitments under the bridge credit agreement were reduced to $0 as a result of cash on hand at AbbVie. AbbVie subsequently terminated the bridge credit agreement in its entirety as permitted under its terms. Credit Risk AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables. Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility In August 2019, AbbVie entered into an amended and restated $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2019 , the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. 36 | 2019 Form 10-K Credit Ratings Following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of Allergan and the $30.0 billion senior notes issuance, Moody's Investor Service affirmed its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook. S&P Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to negative from stable and expects to lower the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1 when the acquisition is complete. Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 : (in millions) Total Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Long-term debt, including current portion $ 67,233 $ 3,750 $ 14,150 $ 7,625 $ 41,708 Interest on long-term debt (a) 30,494 2,146 4,087 3,479 20,782 Non-cancelable operating and finance lease payments (f) 774 129 224 125 296 Purchase obligations and other (b) 3,532 3,295 186 45 6 Other long-term liabilities (c) (d) (e) 11,544 166 1,395 2,123 7,860 Total $ 113,577 $ 9,486 $ 20,042 $ 13,397 $ 70,652 (a) Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2019 . Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2019 . See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2019 . (b) Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business. (c) Excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits. (d) Includes $7.3 billion of contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. (e) Includes a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these tax liabilities. (f) Lease payments include approximately $350 million of contractual minimum lease payments for leases executed but not yet commenced. These leases will commence in 2020 with lease terms of approximately 11 years . AbbVie enters into R&D collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual 2019 Form 10-K | 37 obligations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Rebates and chargebacks totaled $18.8 billion in 2019 , $16.4 billion in 2018 and $12.9 billion in 2017 . Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings. 38 | 2019 Form 10-K The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 94% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2019 . Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (in millions) Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Managed Care Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 1,167 $ 1,167 $ 383 Provisions 2,909 3,990 5,026 Payments (2,736 ) (3,962 ) (4,887 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 1,340 1,195 522 Provisions 3,493 4,729 6,659 Payments (3,188 ) (4,485 ) (6,525 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 1,645 1,439 656 Provisions 4,035 5,772 7,947 Payments (3,915 ) (5,275 ) (7,917 ) Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,765 $ 1,936 $ 686 Cash Discounts and Product Returns Cash discounts and product returns, which totaled $1.6 billion in 2019 , $1.6 billion in 2018 and $1.3 billion in 2017 , are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2019 . A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2019 : 50 basis point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease Defined benefit plans Service and interest cost $ (76 ) $ 92 Projected benefit obligation (723 ) 825 Other post-employment plans Service and interest cost $ (11 ) $ 14 Projected benefit obligation (101 ) 117 The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The 2019 Form 10-K | 39 current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2019 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2020 . A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2020 by $71 million . The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2019 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2020 . A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 : One percentage point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease Service and interest cost $ 40 $ (28 ) Projected benefit obligation 244 (186 ) Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial 40 | 2019 Form 10-K performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Contingent Consideration The fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2019 , a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $280 million . Additionally, at December 31, 2019 , a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $150 million .

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 : 2019 2018 (in millions) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 6,217 1.116 $ (12 ) $ 6,660 1.157 $ 68 Japanese yen 820 108.7 — 1,076 111.5 (12 ) Canadian dollar 504 1.324 (6 ) 406 1.314 14 British pound 427 1.305 (6 ) 499 1.328 21 All other currencies 1,508 n/a (10 ) 1,370 n/a 15 Total $ 9,476 $ (34 ) $ 10,011 $ 106 The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $942 million at December 31, 2019 . If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2019 , the company has €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate Risk The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $280 million at December 31, 2019 . If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $5.0 billion at December 31, 2019 . A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. 42 | 2019 Form 10-K ITEM 8.

(AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100 % of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. On June 25, 2019, AbbVie announced that it entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which AbbVie will acquire Allergan plc (Allergan). See Note 5 for additional information regarding the proposed acquisition. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration liabilities, financial instruments and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less. Discounts, rebates, sales incentives to customers, returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. 2019 Form 10-K | 49 For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. Sales incentives to customers are insignificant. In addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography. Research and Development Expenses Internal research and development (R&D) costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development collaborations, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product. Collaborations and Other Arrangements The company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements during the development stage are expensed to acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of milestones during the development stage are expensed to R&D expense in the consolidated statements of earnings when the milestone is achieved. Milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $ 1.1 billion in 2019 , $ 1.1 billion in 2018 and $ 846 million in 2017 . Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five -year period. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Investments Investments consist primarily of time deposits, marketable debt securities, held-to-maturity debt securities and equity securities. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any 50 | 2019 Form 10-K unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until realized, at which time the gains or losses are recognized in earnings. Investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at cost. Gains or losses on investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie periodically assesses its marketable debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment losses. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below the cost basis and adverse conditions related specifically to the security, including any changes to the credit rating of the security, intent to sell, or whether AbbVie will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. AbbVie also considers industry factors and general market trends. When AbbVie determines that an other-than-temporary decline has occurred, the cost basis of the investment is written down with a charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and an available-for-sale investment's unrealized loss is reclassified from AOCI to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any other-than-temporary declines in fair value that were recorded in net earnings. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information. Accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 46 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 51 million at December 31, 2018 . Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Cost includes material and conversion costs. Inventories consisted of the following: as of December 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Finished goods $ 485 $ 473 Work-in-process 942 862 Raw materials 386 270 Inventories $ 1,813 $ 1,605 Property and Equipment as of December 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Land $ 72 $ 73 Buildings 1,613 1,603 Equipment 6,012 6,362 Construction in progress 491 358 Property and equipment, gross 8,188 8,396 Less accumulated depreciation ( 5,226 ) ( 5,513 ) Property and equipment, net $ 2,962 $ 2,883 Depreciation for property and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life for buildings ranges from 10 to 50 years. Buildings include leasehold improvements which are amortized over the life of the related facility lease (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful life for equipment ranges from 2 to 25 years. Equipment includes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use and is amortized over 3 to 10 years. Depreciation expense was $ 464 million in 2019 , $ 471 million in 2018 and $ 425 million in 2017 . 2019 Form 10-K | 51 Leases Short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. For leases commencing or modified in 2019 or later, AbbVie does not separate lease components from non-lease components. The company records lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. AbbVie generally uses an incremental borrowing rate to discount its lease liabilities, as the rate implicit in the lease is typically not readily determinable. Certain lease agreements include renewal options that are under the company's control. AbbVie includes optional renewal periods in the lease term only when it is reasonably certain that AbbVie will exercise its option. Variable lease payments include payments to lessors for taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs as well as payments that are adjusted based on an index or rate. The company's lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Litigation and Contingencies Loss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if necessary as additional information becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. Business Combinations AbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease 52 | 2019 Form 10-K the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Acquired In-Process Research and Development In an asset acquisition, the initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects acquired are expensed as IPR&D in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. In a business combination, the fair value of IPR&D projects acquired are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&D costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. For derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. The company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI. Derivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2016-02 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . The standard outlined a comprehensive lease accounting model that superseded the previous lease guidance and required lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also changed the definition of a lease and expanded the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2018 have been presented in accordance with the standard, while results for prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with AbbVie's historical accounting. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new leases standard was recognized as an adjustment to the opening consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. The company elected a package of practical expedients for leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019 and did not reassess historical conclusions on: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; (ii) lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) initial direct costs capitalization for any existing leases. 2019 Form 10-K | 53 Under the new standard, on January 1, 2019, the company recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment to its consolidated balance sheet primarily related to the recognition of liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for operating leases. The adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet included: (i) a $ 405 million increase to other assets; (ii) a $ 115 million increase to accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and (iii) a $ 290 million increase to other long-term liabilities. Other cumulative-effect adjustments to the consolidated balance sheet were insignificant. Adoption of the standard did not have a significant impact on AbbVie's consolidated statement of earnings in 2019. ASU No. 2018-02 In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allowed a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for stranded tax effects related to adjustments to deferred taxes resulting from the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act). AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019. Upon adoption, the company made an election to not reclassify the income tax effects of the Act from AOCI to retained earnings. Therefore, the adoption of the standard had no impact on AbbVie's consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted ASU No. 2016-13 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . The standard changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, the standard requires the use of a new forward-looking ""expected credit loss"" model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the standard now requires allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. Additionally, the standard requires new disclosures and will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2020. With certain exceptions, adjustments are to be applied using a modified-retrospective approach by reflecting adjustments through a cumulative-effect impact to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. AbbVie has completed its assessment of the new standard as of December 31, 2019 and concluded that the adoption will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements based on the company's current portfolio of financial assets. ASU No. 2019-12 In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) . The standard includes simplifications related to accounting for income taxes including removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2021, with early adoption permitted. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact and timing of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 54 | 2019 Form 10-K Note 3 Supplemental Financial Information Interest Expense, Net years ended December 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Interest expense $ 1,784 $ 1,348 $ 1,150 Interest income ( 275 ) ( 204 ) ( 146 ) Interest expense, net $ 1,509 $ 1,144 $ 1,004 Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Sales rebates $ 4,484 $ 3,939 Dividends payable 1,771 1,607 Accounts payable 1,452 1,546 Salaries, wages and commissions 830 787 Royalty and license arrangements 324 304 Other 2,971 3,748 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 11,832 $ 11,931 Other Long-Term Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Contingent consideration liabilities $ 7,201 $ 4,306 Income taxes payable 3,453 4,311 Pension and other post-employment benefits 2,949 1,840 Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 2,772 2,726 Other 1,222 1,307 Other long-term liabilities $ 17,597 $ 14,490 Note 4 Earnings Per Share AbbVie grants certain restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive. 2019 Form 10-K | 55 The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method: Years ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 2017 Basic EPS Net earnings $ 7,882 $ 5,687 $ 5,309 Earnings allocated to participating securities 40 30 26 Earnings available to common shareholders $ 7,842 $ 5,657 $ 5,283 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 1,481 1,541 1,596 Basic earnings per share $ 5.30 $ 3.67 $ 3.31 Diluted EPS Net earnings $ 7,882 $ 5,687 $ 5,309 Earnings allocated to participating securities 40 30 26 Earnings available to common shareholders $ 7,842 $ 5,657 $ 5,283 Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 1,481 1,541 1,596 Effect of dilutive securities 3 5 7 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 1,484 1,546 1,603 Diluted earnings per share $ 5.28 $ 3.66 $ 3.30 Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented. Note 5 Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements Proposed Acquisition of Allergan plc On June 25, 2019, AbbVie announced that it entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which AbbVie will acquire Allergan plc (Allergan) in a cash and stock transaction for a transaction equity value of approximately $ 63 billion , based on the closing price of AbbVie’s common stock of $ 78.45 on June 24, 2019. Under the terms of the transaction agreement, Allergan shareholders will receive 0.8660 AbbVie shares and $ 120.30 in cash for each Allergan share. On October 14, 2019, Allergan shareholders approved the proposed transaction. Allergan is a global pharmaceutical leader focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing branded pharmaceutical, device, biologic, surgical and regenerative medicine products for patients around the world. Allergan markets a portfolio of brands and products primarily focused on key therapeutic areas including aesthetics, eye care, neuroscience, gastroenterology and women's health. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. In September 2019, AbbVie and Allergan each received a Request for Additional Information (Second Request) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in connection with the transaction. AbbVie and Allergan are cooperating fully with the FTC. In January 2020, the European Commission approved the proposed acquisition of Allergan by AbbVie conditional upon the divestiture of brazikumab, Allergan's IL-23 inhibitor pipeline product. In January 2020, Allergan entered into a definitive agreement to divest brazikumab contingent upon regulatory approvals and closing of AbbVie's acquisition of Allergan. In anticipation of the proposed acquisition, AbbVie entered into several debt and financing arrangements in 2019. See Note 10 for additional information. Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity Cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $ 1.1 billion in 2019 , $ 736 million in 2018 and $ 308 million in 2017 . AbbVie recorded acquired IPR&D charges of $ 385 million in 2019 , $ 424 million in 2018 and $ 327 million in 2017 . Significant arrangements impacting 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , some of which require contingent milestone payments, are summarized below. 56 | 2019 Form 10-K Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In October 2019, AbbVie and Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Reata) entered into an amended and restated license agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Reata reacquired exclusive development, manufacturing and commercialization rights concerning its proprietary Nrf2 activator product platform originally licensed to AbbVie for territories outside of the United States with respect to bardoxolone methyl and worldwide with respect to omaveloxolone and other next-generation Nrf2 activators . As consideration for the rights reacquired by Reata, AbbVie will receive a total of $ 330 million in cash payable in three installments through 2021, which was recognized in other operating expense (income) in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, AbbVie will receive low single-digit, tiered royalties from worldwide sales of omaveloxolone and certain next-generation Nrf2 activators. Calico Life Sciences LLC In June 2018, AbbVie and Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico) entered into an extension of a collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie and Calico will each contribute an additional $ 500 million to the collaboration and the term is extended for an additional three years . Calico will be responsible for research and early development until 2022 and will advance collaboration projects through Phase 2a through 2027. Following completion of Phase 2a, AbbVie will have the option to exclusively license collaboration compounds. AbbVie will support Calico in its early research and development efforts and, upon exercise, would be responsible for late-stage development and commercial activities. Collaboration costs and profits will be shared equally by both parties post option exercise. During 2018, AbbVie recorded $ 500 million in other operating expense (income) in the consolidated statement of earnings related to its commitments under the agreement. Alector, Inc. In October 2017, AbbVie entered into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. AbbVie and Alector have agreed to research a portfolio of antibody targets, and AbbVie has an option to global development and commercial rights to two targets. The terms of the arrangement included an initial upfront payment of $ 205 million , which was expensed to IPR&D in the fourth quarter of 2017. Alector will conduct exploratory research, drug discovery and development for lead programs up to the conclusion of the proof of concept studies. If the option is exercised, AbbVie will lead development and commercialization activities and could make additional payments to Alector of up to $ 986 million upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Alector and AbbVie will co-fund development and commercialization and will share global profits equally. Other Arrangements In addition to the significant arrangements described above, AbbVie entered into several other arrangements resulting in charges to IPR&D of $ 385 million in 2019 , $ 424 million in 2018 and $ 122 million in 2017 . In connection with the other individually insignificant early-stage arrangements entered into in 2019 , AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $ 5.8 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Note 6 Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc. In December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of IMBRUVICA, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and certain compounds structurally related to IMBRUVICA, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States. The collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize IMBRUVICA outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $ 200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60 % of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40 % of collaboration development costs. 2019 Form 10-K | 57 In the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of IMBRUVICA are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share. Outside the United States, Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize IMBRUVICA. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. AbbVie's share of profits is included in AbbVie's net revenues. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share. The following table shows the profit and cost sharing relationship between Janssen and AbbVie: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 United States - Janssen's share of profits (included in cost of products sold) $ 1,803 $ 1,372 $ 1,001 International - AbbVie's share of profits (included in net revenues) 844 622 429 Global - AbbVie's share of other costs (included in respective line items) 321 326 288 AbbVie’s receivable from Janssen, included in accounts receivable, net, was $ 235 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 177 million at December 31, 2018 . AbbVie’s payable to Janssen, included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, was $ 455 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 376 million at December 31, 2018 . Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill: (in millions) Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ 15,785 Foreign currency translation ( 122 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 15,663 Foreign currency translation ( 59 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 15,604 The company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. As of December 31, 2019 , there were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses. Intangible Assets, Net The following table summarizes intangible assets: 2019 2018 as of December 31 (in millions) Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Definite-lived intangible assets Developed product rights $ 19,547 $ ( 6,405 ) $ 13,142 $ 15,872 $ ( 5,614 ) $ 10,258 License agreements 7,798 ( 2,291 ) 5,507 7,865 ( 1,810 ) 6,055 Total definite-lived intangible assets 27,345 ( 8,696 ) 18,649 23,737 ( 7,424 ) 16,313 Indefinite-lived research and development — — — 4,920 — 4,920 Total intangible assets, net $ 27,345 $ ( 8,696 ) $ 18,649 $ 28,657 $ ( 7,424 ) $ 21,233 58 | 2019 Form 10-K Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPR&D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. The company performs its annual impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. In April 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission approved SKYRIZI (risankizumab) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. As a result, AbbVie reclassified $ 3.9 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to SKYRIZI to developed product rights definite-lived intangible assets. This amount will be amortized over its estimated useful life using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company made a decision to stop enrollment for the TAHOE trial, a Phase 3 study evaluating rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) as a second-line therapy for advanced small-cell lung cancer following a recommendation from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee. This decision lowered the probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate for impairment the IPR&D assets associated with the Stemcentrx acquisition. The company utilized multi-period excess earnings models of the “income approach” and determined that the fair value was $ 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, which was lower than the carrying value of $ 6.1 billion and resulted in an impairment charge of $ 5.1 billion . This impairment charge was recorded to R&D expense in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018. In the third quarter of 2019, following the announcement of the decision to terminate the Rova-T research and development program, the company recorded an impairment charge of $ 1.0 billion which represented the remaining value of the IPR&D acquired as part of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition. This impairment charge was recorded to R&D expense in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019. No indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in 2017 . Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 2 to 16 years with an average of 11 years for both developed product rights and license agreements. Amortization expense was $ 1.6 billion in 2019 , $ 1.3 billion in 2018 and $ 1.1 billion in 2017 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2019 is as follows: (in billions) 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Anticipated annual amortization expense $ 1.8 $ 2.0 $ 2.3 $ 2.4 $ 2.5 No definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in 2019 or 2018 . In 2017, an impairment charge of $ 354 million was recorded related to ZINBRYTA that reduced both the gross carrying amount and net carrying amount of the underlying intangible assets due to lower expected future cash flows for the product. The impairment charge was based on discounted cash flow analyses and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. Note 8 Restructuring Plans AbbVie continuously evaluates its operations to identify opportunities to optimize its manufacturing and R&D operations, commercial infrastructure and administrative costs and to respond to changes in its business environment. As a result, AbbVie management periodically approves individual restructuring plans to achieve these objectives. In 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , no such plans were individually significant. Restructuring charges recorded were $ 234 million in 2019 , $ 70 million in 2018 and $ 86 million in 2017 and were primarily related to employee severance and contractual obligations. These charges were recorded in cost of products sold, R&D expense and SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the classification of the affected employees or operations. 2019 Form 10-K | 59 The following table summarizes the cash activity in the restructuring reserve for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : (in millions) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2016 $ 87 2017 restructuring charges 86 Payments and other adjustments ( 87 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2017 86 2018 restructuring charges 59 Payments and other adjustments ( 46 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2018 99 2019 restructuring charges 219 Payments and other adjustments ( 178 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 140 Note 9 Leases AbbVie's lease portfolio primarily consists of real estate properties, vehicles and equipment.

Future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases and capital leases as of December 31, 2018 prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 did not differ materially from future lease payments, inclusive of payments for leases executed but not yet commenced, under the new standard. 2019 Form 10-K | 61 Note 10 Debt, Credit Facilities and Commitments and Contingencies The following table summarizes long-term debt: as of December 31 (dollars in millions) Effective interest rate in 2019 (a) 2019 Effective interest rate in 2018 (a) 2018 Senior notes issued in 2012 2.90% notes due 2022 2.97 % $ 3,100 2.97 % $ 3,100 4.40% notes due 2042 4.46 % 2,600 4.46 % 2,600 Senior notes issued in 2015 2.50% notes due 2020 2.65 % 3,750 2.65 % 3,750 3.20% notes due 2022 3.28 % 1,000 3.28 % 1,000 3.60% notes due 2025 3.66 % 3,750 3.66 % 3,750 4.50% notes due 2035 4.58 % 2,500 4.58 % 2,500 4.70% notes due 2045 4.73 % 2,700 4.73 % 2,700 Senior notes issued in 2016 2.30% notes due 2021 2.40 % 1,800 2.40 % 1,800 2.85% notes due 2023 2.91 % 1,000 2.91 % 1,000 3.20% notes due 2026 3.28 % 2,000 3.28 % 2,000 4.30% notes due 2036 4.37 % 1,000 4.37 % 1,000 4.45% notes due 2046 4.50 % 2,000 4.50 % 2,000 Senior Euro notes issued in 2016 0.375% notes due 2019 (€1,400 principal) 0.55 % — 0.55 % 1,604 1.375% notes due 2024 (€1,450 principal) 1.46 % 1,625 1.46 % 1,661 2.125% notes due 2028 (€750 principal) 2.18 % 840 2.18 % 859 Senior notes issued in 2018 3.375% notes due 2021 3.51 % 1,250 3.51 % 1,250 3.75% notes due 2023 3.84 % 1,250 3.84 % 1,250 4.25% notes due 2028 4.38 % 1,750 4.38 % 1,750 4.875% notes due 2048 4.94 % 1,750 4.94 % 1,750 Senior Euro notes issued in 2019 0.75% notes due 2027 (€750 principal) 0.86 % 840 — — 1.25% notes due 2031 (€650 principal) 1.30 % 728 — — Senior notes issued in 2019 Floating rate notes due May 2021 2.08 % 750 — — Floating rate notes due November 2021 2.12 % 750 — — Floating rate notes due 2022 2.29 % 750 — — 2.15% notes due 2021 2.23 % 1,750 — — 2.30% notes due 2022 2.42 % 3,000 — — 2.60% notes due 2024 2.69 % 3,750 — — 2.95% notes due 2026 3.02 % 4,000 — — 3.20% notes due 2029 3.25 % 5,500 — — 4.05% notes due 2039 4.11 % 4,000 — — 4.25% notes due 2049 4.29 % 5,750 — — Other 27 36 Fair value hedges ( 48 ) ( 466 ) Unamortized bond discounts ( 161 ) ( 120 ) Unamortized deferred financing costs ( 323 ) ( 163 ) Total long-term debt and finance lease obligations 66,728 36,611 Current portion 3,753 1,609 Noncurrent portion $ 62,975 $ 35,002 (a) Excludes the effect of any related interest rate swaps. 62 | 2019 Form 10-K Allergan-Related Financing In connection with the proposed acquisition of Allergan, in November 2019, the company issued $ 30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $ 750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due May 2021, $ 750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due November 2021, $ 750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2022, $ 1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.15 % senior notes due 2021, $ 3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.30 % senior notes due 2022, $ 3.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.60 % senior notes due 2024, $ 4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95 % senior notes due 2026, $ 5.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.20 % senior notes due 2029, $ 4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.05 % senior notes due 2039 and $ 5.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.25 % senior notes due 2049. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the fixed-rate senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount or the sum of present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the fixed-rate senior notes to be redeemed plus a make-whole premium. With exception of the fixed-rate notes due 2021 and 2022, AbbVie may also redeem the fixed-rate senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $ 173 million and debt discounts totaled $ 52 million , which are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie expects to use the net proceeds to fund a portion of the aggregate cash consideration due to Allergan shareholders in connection with the proposed acquisition described in Note 5 and to pay related fees and expenses. Pending the consummation of the proposed Allergan acquisition, the net proceeds from the offering are permitted to be invested temporarily in short-term investments. All of the notes are subject to special mandatory redemption at a redemption price equal to 101 % of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if the proposed acquisition of Allergan is not completed by January 30, 2021 or the company notifies the trustee in respect of the notes that it will not pursue the consummation of the proposed Allergan acquisition. On June 25, 2019, AbbVie entered into a $ 38.0 billion 364 -day bridge credit agreement. On July 12, 2019, AbbVie entered into a term loan credit agreement with an aggregate principal amount of $ 6.0 billion consisting of a $ 1.5 billion 364 -day term loan tranche, a $ 2.5 billion three-year term loan tranche and a $ 2.0 billion five-year term loan tranche. In connection with the agreements, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $ 242 million and were recorded to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Upon commencement of the $ 6.0 billion term loan credit agreement and upon issuance of the $ 30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, commitments under the bridge credit agreement were reduced to $ 2.0 billion . No amounts were drawn under the bridge credit agreement or term loan credit agreement at December 31, 2019 . In February 2020, the remaining commitments under the bridge credit agreement were reduced to $ 0 as a result of cash on hand at AbbVie. AbbVie subsequently terminated the bridge credit agreement in its entirety as permitted under its terms. On October 25, 2019, AbbVie commenced offers to exchange any and all outstanding notes of certain series issued by Allergan for up to $ 15.5 billion aggregate principal amount and € 3.7 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes to be issued by AbbVie and cash, subject to conditions including the closing of the pending acquisition of Allergan. Concurrently with the offers to exchange the Allergan notes for AbbVie notes, the company solicited consents to adopt certain proposed amendments to each of the indentures governing the Allergan notes to, among other things, eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants in such indentures. In November 2019, the company announced that the requisite number of consents had been received to adopt the proposed amendments with respect to all Allergan notes and that Allergan executed a supplemental indenture with respect to each Allergan indenture implementing the amendments, which will become operative only upon settlement of the exchange offers. The expiration of the exchange offers is expected to occur on or about the closing date of AbbVie’s acquisition of Allergan. Other Long-Term Debt In September 2019, the company issued € 1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes, consisting of € 750 million aggregate principal amount of 0.75 % senior notes due 2027 and € 650 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25 % senior notes due 2031.

Short-Term Borrowings Short-term borrowings included commercial paper borrowings of $ 699 million as of December 31, 2018 . There were no commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2019 . The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings was 2.5 % in 2019 , 2.0 % in 2018 and 1.3 % in 2017 . In August 2019, AbbVie entered into an amended and restated $ 4.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants, all of which the company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2019 . Commitment fees under AbbVie's revolving credit facilities were insignificant in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facilities as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 .

Maturities of Long-Term Debt The following table summarizes AbbVie's debt maturities as of December 31, 2019 : as of and for the years ending December 31 (in millions) 2020 $ 3,750 2021 6,300 2022 7,850 2023 2,250 2024 5,375 Thereafter 41,708 Total obligations and commitments 67,233 Fair value hedges, unamortized bond discounts, deferred financing costs and finance lease obligations ( 505 ) Total long-term debt and finance lease obligations $ 66,728 64 | 2019 Form 10-K Contingencies and Guarantees In connection with the separation, AbbVie has indemnified Abbott for all liabilities resulting from the operation of AbbVie's business other than income tax liabilities with respect to periods prior to the distribution date and other liabilities as agreed to by AbbVie and Abbott. AbbVie has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements and no special-purpose entities. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie has periodically entered into third-party agreements, such as the assignment of product rights, which have resulted in AbbVie becoming secondarily liable for obligations for which AbbVie had previously been primarily liable. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. Note 11 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Risk Management Policy The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. AbbVie's hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. AbbVie also periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the company's outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required. Financial Instruments Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $ 957 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 1.4 billion at December 31, 2018 , are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than eighteen months . Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2019 will be reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement. In the third quarter of 2019, the company entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $ 10.0 billion to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates related to the issuance of long-term debt in connection with the proposed acquisition of Allergan. The treasury rate lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value. The agreements were net settled upon issuance of the senior notes in November 2019 resulting in a gain of $ 383 million recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). This gain will be reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $ 2.3 billion at December 31, 2019 . The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a floating-rate interest obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the floating-rate debt. The contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in AOCI and will be reclassified to interest expense, net over the lives of the floating-rate debt. The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $ 7.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and $ 8.6 billion at December 31, 2018 . The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The company had € 3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes designated as net investment hedges at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . In the third quarter of 2019, the company issued € 1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes and designated the principal amounts of this foreign denominated debt as net investment hedges. Concurrently, the company elected to de-designate hedge accounting for € 1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of existing senior Euro notes which were subsequently repaid in October 2019. In addition, in 2019, the company entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and designated the instruments as net investment hedges. These contracts had notional amounts totaling € 971 million , £ 204 million and CHF 62 million at December 31, 2019 . The company uses the spot method of assessing hedge effectiveness for derivative 2019 Form 10-K | 65 instruments designated as net investment hedges. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI and the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in interest expense, net over the life of the hedging instrument. AbbVie is a party to interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $ 10.8 billion at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.

The fair values of available-for-sale debt securities were determined based on prices obtained from commercial pricing services. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using observable market inputs including published interest rate curves and both forward and spot prices for foreign currencies. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2019 , a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $ 280 million . Additionally, at December 31, 2019 , a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $ 150 million . There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between the fair value measurement levels. The following table presents the changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Beginning balance $ 4,483 $ 4,534 $ 4,213 Change in fair value recognized in net earnings 3,091 49 626 Payments ( 234 ) ( 100 ) ( 305 ) Ending balance $ 7,340 $ 4,483 $ 4,534 The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. During the second quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 2.3 billion increase in the SKYRIZI contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success, higher estimated future sales and declining interest rates. The higher probabilities of success resulted from the April 2019 regulatory approvals of SKYRIZI for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. During the third quarter of 2019, the company recorded a $ 91 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to the termination of the Rova-T research and development program. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recorded a $ 428 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to a reduction in probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval. 68 | 2019 Form 10-K Certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

The company has established credit exposure limits and monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with financial institution deposits. Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 68 % as of December 31, 2019 and 63 % as of December 31, 2018 , and substantially all of AbbVie's net revenues in the United States were to these three wholesalers. HUMIRA (adalimumab) is AbbVie's single largest product and accounted for approximately 58 % of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2019 , 61 % in 2018 and 65 % in 2017 . Note 12 Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie sponsors various pension and other post-employment benefit plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide.

The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 % in 2050 and remain at that level thereafter. For purposes of measuring the 2019 post-retirement health care costs, the company assumed a 6.6 % pre-65 ( 7.3 % post-65) annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5 % for 2050 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. As of December 31, 2019 , a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: One percentage point year ended December 31, 2019 (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease Service cost and interest cost $ 13 $ ( 10 ) Projected benefit obligation 244 ( 186 ) Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions) 2019 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities U.S. large cap (a) $ 884 $ 884 $ — $ — U.S. mid cap (b) 138 138 — — International (c) 349 349 — — Fixed income securities U.S. government securities (d) 149 21 128 — Corporate debt instruments (d) 372 112 260 — Non-U.S. government securities (d) 202 84 118 — Other (d) 320 318 2 — Absolute return funds (e) 296 4 292 — Real assets 9 9 — — Other (f) 132 132 — — Total $ 2,851 $ 2,051 $ 800 $ — Total assets measured at NAV 4,265 Fair value of plan assets $ 7,116 72 | 2019 Form 10-K Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions) 2018 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities U.S. large cap (a) $ 719 $ 719 $ — $ — U.S. mid cap (b) 67 67 — — International (c) 226 226 — — Fixed income securities U.S. government securities (d) 140 21 119 — Corporate debt instruments (d) 385 123 262 — Non-U.S. government securities (d) 175 48 127 — Other (d) 232 225 7 — Absolute return funds (e) 261 3 258 — Real assets 7 7 — — Other (f) 147 147 — — Total $ 2,359 $ 1,586 $ 773 $ — Total assets measured at NAV 3,278 Fair value of plan assets $ 5,637 (a) A mix of index funds and actively managed equity accounts that are benchmarked to various large cap indices.

(e) Primarily funds having global mandates with the flexibility to allocate capital broadly across a wide range of asset classes and strategies, including but not limited to equities, fixed income, commodities, financial futures, currencies and other securities, with objectives to outperform agreed upon benchmarks of specific return and volatility targets. (f) Investments in cash and cash equivalents. Equities and registered investment companies having quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are quoted at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. Investments held in pooled investment funds, common collective trusts or limited partnerships are valued at the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is provided by the fund administrator and is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are established for each plan and are generally made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The 2019 target investment allocation for the AbbVie Pension Plan was 35 % in equity securities, 20 % in fixed income securities and 45 % in asset allocation strategies and other holdings. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets of the AbbVie Pension Plan or of any other plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption for each plan is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. 2019 Form 10-K | 73 Expected Benefit Payments The following table summarizes total benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants including payments funded from both plan and company assets: years ending December 31 (in millions) Defined benefit plans Other post-employment plans 2020 $ 221 $ 18 2021 235 21 2022 251 24 2023 268 26 2024 286 29 2025 to 2029 1,737 186 Defined Contribution Plan AbbVie's principal defined contribution plan is the AbbVie Savings Plan. AbbVie recorded expense of $ 102 million in 2019 , $ 89 million in 2018 and $ 82 million in 2017 related to this plan. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees. Note 13 Equity Stock-Based Compensation AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP), which provides for several different forms of benefits, including nonqualified stock options, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the 2013 ISP, 100 million shares of AbbVie common stock were reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees. The 2013 ISP also facilitated the assumption of certain awards granted under Abbott’s incentive stock program, which were adjusted and converted into Abbott and AbbVie stock-based awards as a result of AbbVie's separation from Abbott. AbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least 10 years of service. Stock-based compensation expense is principally related to awards issued pursuant to the 2013 ISP and is summarized as follows: Years ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Cost of products sold $ 29 $ 27 $ 23 Research and development 171 169 159 Selling, general and administrative 230 225 183 Pre-tax compensation expense 430 421 365 Tax benefit 80 73 73 After-tax compensation expense $ 350 $ 348 $ 292 Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $ 15 million in 2019 , $ 78 million in 2018 and $ 71 million in 2017 . 74 | 2019 Form 10-K Stock Options Stock options awarded to employees typically have a contractual term of 10 years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three -year period. The exercise price is equal to at least 100 % of the market value on the date of grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted were $ 12.54 in 2019 , $ 21.63 in 2018 and $ 9.80 in 2017 . The following table summarizes AbbVie stock option activity in 2019 : (options in thousands, aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Options Weighted- average exercise price Weighted- average remaining life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value Outstanding at December 31, 2018 6,143 $ 55.05 6.2 $ 242 Granted 1,002 79.02 Exercised ( 375 ) 23.72 Lapsed ( 9 ) 20.09 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 6,761 $ 60.39 5.9 $ 207 Exercisable at December 31, 2019 4,924 $ 51.90 4.9 $ 186 The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 22 million in 2019 , $ 215 million in 2018 and $ 371 million in 2017 . The total fair value of options vested during 2019 was $ 13 million . As of December 31, 2019 , $ 6 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . RSUs and Performance Shares RSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees generally vest in one-third increments over a three year period. Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period. The majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and other key employees are performance-based. Equity awards granted to senior executives and other key employees consist of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares as well as non-qualified stock options described above. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a three -year performance period based on AbbVie’s ROE relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. The recipient may receive one share of AbbVie common stock for each vested award. The performance shares have the potential to vest over a three -year performance period and may be earned based on AbbVie’s EPS achievement and AbbVie’s total stockholder return (TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-vested RSUs and performance shares accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs and performance shares generally is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the quoted price of AbbVie’s common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table summarizes AbbVie RSU and performance share activity for 2019 : (share units in thousands) Share units Weighted-average grant date fair value Outstanding at December 31, 2018 9,868 $ 79.90 Granted 5,584 78.03 Vested ( 4,616 ) 71.30 Forfeited ( 604 ) 82.19 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 10,232 $ 81.72 The fair market value of RSUs and performance shares (as applicable) vested was $ 371 million in 2019 , $ 583 million in 2018 and $ 348 million in 2017 . 2019 Form 10-K | 75 As of December 31, 2019 , $ 327 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs and performance shares is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . Cash Dividends Cash dividends declared per common share totaled $ 4.39 in 2019 , $ 3.95 in 2018 and $ 2.63 in 2017 .

The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased under these programs are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses and are available for general corporate purposes. AbbVie repurchased 4 million shares for $ 300 million in 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was approximately $ 4.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 . On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $ 10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. On December 13, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $ 5.0 billion increase to the existing $ 10.0 billion stock repurchase program. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased approximately 109 million shares for $ 10.7 billion in 2018. Under previous stock repurchase programs, AbbVie made open-market share repurchases of approximately 11 million shares for $ 1.3 billion in 2018 and approximately 13 million shares for $ 1.0 billion in 2017 . 76 | 2019 Form 10-K Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table summarizes the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : (in millions) (brackets denote losses) Foreign currency translation adjustments Net investment hedging activities Pension and post- employment benefits Marketable security activities Cash flow hedging activities Total Balance as of December 31, 2016 $ ( 1,435 ) $ 140 $ ( 1,513 ) $ 46 $ 176 $ ( 2,586 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 680 ( 343 ) ( 480 ) 29 ( 230 ) ( 344 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss 316 — 74 ( 75 ) ( 112 ) 203 Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) 996 ( 343 ) ( 406 ) ( 46 ) ( 342 ) ( 141 ) Balance as of December 31, 2017 ( 439 ) ( 203 ) ( 1,919 ) — ( 166 ) ( 2,727 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 391 ) 138 84 ( 14 ) 156 ( 27 ) Net losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — — 113 4 157 274 Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 391 ) 138 197 ( 10 ) 313 247 Balance as of December 31, 2018 ( 830 ) ( 65 ) ( 1,722 ) ( 10 ) 147 ( 2,480 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 98 ) 95 ( 1,330 ) 12 298 ( 1,023 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — ( 21 ) 87 ( 2 ) ( 157 ) ( 93 ) Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 98 ) 74 ( 1,243 ) 10 141 ( 1,116 ) Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ ( 928 ) $ 9 $ ( 2,965 ) $ — $ 288 $ ( 3,596 ) Other comprehensive loss included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling losses of $ 98 million in 2019 and $ 391 million in 2018 which were principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets. In 2017, AbbVie reclassified $ 316 million of historical currency translation losses from AOCI related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of U.S. tax reform. These losses were included in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statement of earnings and had no related income tax impacts. Other comprehensive loss in 2017 also included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a gain of $ 680 million , which was principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the Euro on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive loss for 2019 included pension and post-employment benefit plan losses of $ 1.2 billion primarily due to an actuarial loss driven by lower discount rates. See Note 12 for additional information. 2019 Form 10-K | 77 The table below presents the impact on AbbVie's consolidated statements of earnings for significant amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss: years ended December 31 (in millions) (brackets denote gains) 2019 2018 2017 Net investment hedging activities Gains on derivative amount excluded from effectiveness testing (a) $ ( 27 ) $ — $ — Tax expense 6 — — Total reclassifications, net of tax $ ( 21 ) $ — $ — Pension and post-employment benefits Amortization of actuarial losses and other (b) $ 110 $ 141 $ 107 Tax benefit ( 23 ) ( 28 ) ( 33 ) Total reclassifications, net of tax $ 87 $ 113 $ 74 Cash flow hedging activities Losses (gains) on foreign currency forward exchange contracts (c) $ ( 167 ) $ 161 $ ( 118 ) Gains on treasury rate lock agreements and interest rate swap contracts (a) ( 4 ) — — Tax expense (benefit) 14 ( 4 ) 6 Total reclassifications, net of tax $ ( 157 ) $ 157 $ ( 112 ) (a) Amounts are included in interest expense, net (see Note 11 ).

The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 % and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously untaxed. These changes were generally effective for tax years beginning in 2018. The Act also created a minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The company’s accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings is to report the tax effects on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense. Additionally, the Act significantly changed the timing and manner in which earnings of foreign subsidiaries are subject to U.S. tax. Therefore, unremitted foreign earnings previously considered indefinitely reinvested that were subject to the Act’s transition tax are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. Post-2017 earnings subject to the U.S. minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings and the 100 percent foreign dividends received deduction are also not considered indefinitely reinvested earnings. As such, the company records foreign withholding tax liabilities related to the future cash repatriation of such earnings. However, the company considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution) to be permanent in duration. The unrecognized tax liability is not practicable to determine. Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation years ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 35.0 % Effect of foreign operations ( 8.4 ) ( 28.7 ) ( 12.2 ) U.S. tax credits ( 3.3 ) ( 7.3 ) ( 4.0 ) Impacts related to U.S. tax reform ( 1.6 ) 8.2 12.0 Stock-based compensation excess tax benefit ( 0.2 ) ( 1.5 ) ( 0.9 ) Tax audit settlements ( 4.7 ) ( 2.5 ) ( 1.2 ) Deferred tax remeasurements due to change in tax rate 3.1 — — All other, net 0.6 1.4 2.6 Effective tax rate 6.5 % ( 9.4 )% 31.3 % The effective income tax rate fluctuates year to year due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, as well as certain discrete factors and events in each year, including changes in tax law, acquisitions and collaborations. The effective income tax rates in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to changes in enacted tax rates and laws, the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, the cost of repatriation decisions, Boehringer Ingelheim accretion on contingent consideration and Stemcentrx impairment related expenses. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. The effective income tax rate in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 included impacts related to U.S. tax reform. In 2018, there was a favorable impact of the effective date of provisions of the Act related to the earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. For 2019, the impact of the Act affected the full year earnings of these subsidiaries, resulting in additional tax expense compared to prior year. The 2019 effective income tax rate also reflects the effects of deferred tax remeasurement due to a change in foreign tax law, accretion for contingent consideration and impairment related expenses. In addition, the company recognized a net tax benefit of $ 400 million in 2019 , $ 131 million in 2018 and $ 91 million in 2017 related to the resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years. 2019 Form 10-K | 79 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Deferred tax assets Compensation and employee benefits $ 810 $ 529 Accruals and reserves 371 371 Chargebacks and rebates 477 417 Advance payments 615 867 Net operating losses and other credit carryforwards 838 228 Other 406 353 Total deferred tax assets 3,517 2,765 Valuation allowances ( 731 ) ( 103 ) Total net deferred tax assets 2,786 2,662 Deferred tax liabilities Excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets ( 2,712 ) ( 2,940 ) Excess of book basis over tax basis in investments ( 249 ) ( 211 ) Other ( 440 ) ( 250 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 3,401 ) ( 3,401 ) Net deferred tax liabilities $ ( 615 ) $ ( 739 ) As of December 31, 2019 , gross state net operating losses were $ 1.0 billion and tax credit carryforwards were $ 188 million . The state tax carryforwards expire between 2020 and 2039. As of December 31, 2019 , foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $ 2.9 billion . Foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 2.8 billion expire between 2020 and 2036 and the remaining do not have an expiration period. The company had valuation allowances of $ 731 million as of December 31, 2019 and $ 103 million as of December 31, 2018 . These were principally related to foreign and state net operating losses and credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. Unrecognized Tax Benefits years ended December 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Beginning balance $ 2,852 $ 2,701 $ 1,168 Increase due to current year tax positions 113 163 1,768 Increase due to prior year tax positions 499 110 16 Decrease due to prior year tax positions ( 21 ) ( 36 ) ( 2 ) Settlements ( 749 ) ( 79 ) ( 233 ) Lapse of statutes of limitations ( 33 ) ( 7 ) ( 16 ) Ending balance $ 2,661 $ 2,852 $ 2,701 AbbVie and Abbott entered into a tax sharing agreement, effective on the date of separation, which provides that Abbott is liable for and has indemnified AbbVie against all income tax liabilities for periods prior to the separation. AbbVie will be responsible for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties for periods after separation or in instances where an existing entity was transferred to AbbVie upon separation. If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the company's effective tax rate is $ 2.4 billion in 2019 and $ 2.7 billion in 2018 . Of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the table above as of December 31, 2019 , AbbVie would be indemnified for approximately $ 83 million . The “Increase due to current year tax positions” and ""Increase due to prior year tax positions"" in the table above include amounts related to federal, state and international tax items. AbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie recognized gross income tax expense of $ 51 million in 2019 , $ 73 million in 2018 and $ 24 million in 2017 , for interest and penalties related to income tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross 80 | 2019 Form 10-K interest and penalties of $ 191 million at December 31, 2019 , $ 190 million at December 31, 2018 and $ 120 million at December 31, 2017 . The company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible during the next 12 months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months up to $ 54 million . All significant federal, state, local and international matters have been concluded for years through 2012. The company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. Note 15 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation was approximately $ 290 million as of December 31, 2019 and approximately $ 350 million as of December 31, 2018 . Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. In addition, other operating income in 2019 included $ 550 million of income from a legal settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with a third party . While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Four lawsuits against Unimed Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) and others remained consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under the Multi-District Litigation (MDL) Rules as In re: AndroGel Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2084. These cases, brought by direct AndroGel purchasers, generally allege Solvay's 2006 patent litigation settlement agreements and related agreements with three generic companies violate federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages and attorneys' fees. Three of those lawsuits were settled in December 2019 and will be dismissed. In September 2014, the FTC filed a lawsuit, FTC v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that the 2011 patent litigation with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of that litigation violated federal antitrust law. In May 2015, the court dismissed the FTC’s settlement-related claim. In June 2018, following a bench trial, the court found for the FTC on its sham litigation claim and ordered a disgorgement remedy of $ 448 million , plus prejudgment interest. The court denied the FTC’s request for injunctive relief. AbbVie is appealing the court’s liability and disgorgement rulings and, based on an assessment of the merits of that appeal, no liability has been accrued for this matter. The FTC is also appealing aspects of the court’s trial ruling and the dismissal of its settlement-related claim. In July 2018, a purported class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on behalf of direct AndroGel purchasers based on the trial court’s ruling in the FTC’s case. In September 2019, two individual direct AndroGel purchasers substituted in as the plaintiffs in that lawsuit and withdrew the class allegations. That case, which was pending as Rochester Drug Co-Operative, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al., was settled in December 2019 and will be dismissed. In August 2019, direct purchasers of AndroGel filed a lawsuit, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., et al. v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, making allegations similar to those in In re: AndroGel Antitrust Litigation (No. II) , MDL No. 2084 (above) and FTC v. AbbVie Inc. (above). Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by Niaspan direct purchasers and one brought by Niaspan end-payers. The cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern 2019 Form 10-K | 81 District of Pennsylvania for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2460. In August 2019, the court certified a class of direct purchasers of Niaspan. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In May 2018, the California Court of Appeal ruled that the District Attorney’s Office may not bring monetary claims beyond the scope of Orange County, which the District Attorney’s Office is appealing. Between March and May 2019, 12 putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by indirect HUMIRA purchasers, alleging that AbbVie’s settlements with biosimilar manufacturers and AbbVie’s HUMIRA patent portfolio violate state and federal antitrust laws. The court consolidated these lawsuits as In re: Humira (Adalimumab) Antitrust Litigation . In November 2014, a putative class action lawsuit, Medical Mutual of Ohio v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , was filed against several manufacturers of testosterone replacement therapies (TRTs), including AbbVie, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of all insurance companies, health benefit providers, and other third party payers who paid for TRTs, including AndroGel. The claims asserted included violations of the federal RICO Act and state consumer fraud and deceptive trade practices laws. The complaint sought monetary damages and injunctive relief. In July 2018, the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for class certification. In November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s grant of the defendants’ summary judgment motion. In July 2019, the New Mexico Attorney General filed a lawsuit, State of New Mexico ex rel. Balderas v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , in New Mexico District Court for Santa Fe County against AbbVie and other companies alleging their marketing of AndroGel violated New Mexico’s Unfair Practices Act. In September 2018, the Commissioner of the California Department of Insurance intervened in a qui tam lawsuit, State of California and Lazaro Suarez v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , brought under the California Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, in California Superior Court for Alameda County. The Department of Insurance’s complaint alleges that, through patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value provided in connection with HUMIRA, AbbVie caused the submission of fraudulent commercial insurance claims for HUMIRA in violation of the California statute. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an assessment of up to three times the amount of the claims at issue, and civil penalties. In addition, a federal securities lawsuit ( Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al .) is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for HUMIRA sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2017 were misleading because they omitted the conduct alleged in the Department of Insurance’s complaint. In November 2014, five individuals filed a putative class action lawsuit, Rubinstein, et al. v Gonzalez, et al., on behalf of purchasers and sellers of certain Shire plc (Shire) securities between June 20 and October 14, 2014, against AbbVie and its chief executive officer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the defendants made and/or are responsible for material misstatements in violation of federal securities laws in connection with AbbVie's proposed transaction with Shire. In October 2019, the court granted final approval to the parties’ class settlement agreement. In June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc. , was filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in connec tion with its proposed t ransaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were filed between July 2017 and October 2019 against AbbVie and in some instances its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. Product liability cases were filed in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie and other manufacturers of TRTs did not adequately warn about risks of certain injuries, primarily heart attacks, strokes and blood clots. Approximately 3,500 claims against AbbVie are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the MDL Rules as In re: Testosterone Replacement Therapy Products Liability Litigation , MDL No. 2545. Approximately 175 claims against AbbVie are pending in various state courts. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. In November 2018, AbbVie entered into a Master Settlement Agreement with the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee in the MDL encompassing existing claims in all courts. All proceedings in pending cases are effectively stayed during the settlement administration process. Product liability cases are pending in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie did not adequately warn about risk of certain injuries, primarily various birth defects, arising from use of Depakote. Approximately 120 cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, and approximately 14 others are pending in various federal and state courts. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. Approximately eighty percent of these pending 82 | 2019 Form 10-K cases, plus other unfiled claims, are subject to confidential settlement agreements and are expected to be dismissed with prejudice. Beginning in May 2016, the Patent Trial & Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (PTO) instituted five inter partes review proceedings brought by Coherus Biosciences and Boehringer Ingelheim related to three AbbVie patents covering methods of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis using adalimumab. In these proceedings, the PTO reviewed the validity of the patents and issued decisions of invalidity in May, June and July of 2017. In January 2020, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the decisions. In March 2017, AbbVie filed a lawsuit, AbbVie Inc. v.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 88 | 2019 Form 10-K Sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Revenue Recognition,” the Company established provisions for sales rebates in the same period as the related product is sold. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $4,484 million in sales rebate accruals, a large portion of which were for rebates provided to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans and private entities for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. In order to establish these sales rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based upon the identification of the products subject to a rebate, the applicable price and rebate terms and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment of the rebate. Auditing the Medicaid, Medicare and managed care sales rebate accruals was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the accruals consider multiple subjective and complex estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions included the estimated inventory in the distribution channel, which impacts the lag time between the sale to the customer and payment of the rebate and the final payer related to product sales, which impacts the applicable price and rebate terms. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information to estimate product in the distribution channels, payer mix, prescription volumes and historical experience. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare and managed care programs. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the estimation of Medicaid, Medicare and managed care rebates, among others, including the significant assumptions discussed above. The testing was inclusive of management’s controls to evaluate the accuracy of its reserve judgments to actual rebates paid, rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare, and managed care programs, our audit procedures included, among others, understanding and evaluating the significant assumptions and underlying data used in management’s calculations. Our testing of significant assumptions included corroboration to external data sources. We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions in light of industry and economic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performed analytical procedures, based on internal and external data sources, to evaluate the completeness of the reserves. For Medicaid, we involved a specialist with an understanding of statutory reimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company’s calculation methodologies with applicable government regulations and policy. Valuation of contingent consideration Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Business Combinations” and in Note 11 under the caption “Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures,” the Company recognized contingent consideration liabilities at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date in connection with applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities were recorded within the consolidated statement of earnings in the period of change. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $7,340 million in contingent consideration liabilities, which represented a ‘Level 3’ fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy due to the significant unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value and the use of management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the liabilities. Auditing the valuation of contingent consideration liabilities was complex and required significant auditor judgment due to the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model and the high degree of subjectivity in evaluating certain assumptions required to estimate the fair value of contingent royalty payments. In particular, the fair value measurement was sensitive to the significant assumptions underlying the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Management utilized its expertise within the industry and knowledge of clinical development and regulatory approval processes to determine certain of these assumptions. 2019 Form 10-K | 89 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s contingent consideration liabilities process including, among others, management’s process to establish the significant assumptions and measure the liability. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the determination of fair value. The testing was inclusive of key management review controls to monitor and evaluate clinical development of the acquired products and estimated future sales, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources. To test the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting the terms of the executed agreement, assessing the Monte Carlo simulation model used and testing the key contractual inputs and significant assumptions discussed above. We evaluated the assumptions and judgments in light of observable industry and economic trends and standards, external data sources and regulatory factors. Estimated amounts of future sales were evaluated for reasonableness in relation to internal and external analyses, clinical development progress and timelines, probability of success benchmarks, and regulatory notices. Our procedures included evaluating the data sources used by management in determining its assumptions and, where necessary, included an evaluation of available information that either corroborated or contradicted management’s conclusions. We involved a valuation specialist to assess the Company’s Monte Carlo simulation model and to perform corroborative fair value calculations. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. Chicago, Illinois February 21, 2020 90 | 2019 Form 10-K ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Robert A. Michael, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 . Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls. AbbVie's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie's disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Management of AbbVie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that AbbVie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . 2019 Form 10-K | 91 Report of independent registered public accounting firm.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 21, 2020 2019 Form 10-K | 93 ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS Overview AbbVie (1) is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie develops and markets advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; pain associated with endometriosis; as well as other serious health conditions.

AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012.

IMBRUVICA was one of the first medicines to receive a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval after being granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation and is one of the few therapies to receive four separate designations. IMBRUVICA currently is approved for the treatment of adult patients with: • Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and CLL/SLL with 17p deletion; • Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy*; • Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM); • Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy*; and • Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. _______________________________________________________________________________ * Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate.

VENCLEXTA (venetoclax) is a BCL-2 inhibitor used to treat adults with CLL or SLL, with or without 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior treatment. In addition, VENCLEXTA is used in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine to treat adults with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are 75 years of age or older or have other medical conditions that prevent the use of standard chemotherapy.

It is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, who previously have been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. It is an 8-week, pan-genotypic treatment for patients without cirrhosis and who are new to treatment. VIEKIRA PAK AND TECHNIVIE.

NORVIR (ritonavir) is a protease inhibitor that is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 2 | 2018 Form 10-K Metabolics/Hormones products. Metabolic and hormone products target a number of conditions, including testosterone deficiency due to certain underlying conditions, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and hypothyroidism. These products include: CREON. CREON (pancrelipase) is a pancreatic enzyme therapy for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, a condition that occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis and several other conditions. Synthroid. Synthroid (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP) is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism. AndroGel. AndroGel (testosterone gel) is a testosterone replacement therapy for males diagnosed with symptomatic low testosterone due to certain underlying conditions. AbbVie has the rights to sell AndroGel, CREON and Synthroid only in the United States. Endocrinology products. Lupron (leuprolide acetate), which is also marketed as Lucrin and LUPRON DEPOT, is a product for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer, treatment of endometriosis and central precocious puberty and for the preoperative treatment of patients with anemia caused by uterine fibroids. Lupron is approved for daily subcutaneous injection and one-month, three-month, four-month and six-month intramuscular injection. Other products. AbbVie's other products include: ORILISSA. ORILISSA (elagolix) is the first and only orally-administered, nonpeptide small molecule gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist specifically developed for women with moderate to severe endometriosis pain. The FDA approved ORILISSA under priority review. It represents the first FDA-approved oral treatment for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in over a decade. ORILISSA inhibits endogenous GnRH signaling by binding competitively to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. Administration results in dose-dependent suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, leading to decreased blood concentrations of ovarian sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone. Duopa and Duodopa (carbidopa and levodopa). AbbVie's levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease is marketed as Duopa in the United States and as Duodopa outside of the United States. Sevoflurane. Sevoflurane (sold under the trademarks Ultane and Sevorane) is an anesthesia product that AbbVie sells worldwide for human use. Marketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities AbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and distribute its products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand of products by physicians, key opinion leaders and other health care providers. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie also markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States all of the company's products must be sold pursuant to a prescription. Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its marketing efforts on key opinion leaders, payers, physicians and country regulatory bodies. AbbVie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality, AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. In 2018 , three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States . No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 42% of AbbVie's 2018 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, products are sold primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. These wholesalers purchase product from AbbVie under standard terms and conditions of sale. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's 2018 Form 10-K | 3 business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business. Competition The markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, HUMIRA competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and AbbVie's virology products compete with other available HCV treatment options. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVie’s competitors could cause revenues for AbbVie’s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases. Biosimilars. Competition for AbbVie’s biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as “biosimilars.” Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for conventional (small molecule) medications, and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products. HUMIRA is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, which represent approximately 75% of AbbVie's international HUMIRA business or approximately 25% of total global HUMIRA revenues. AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products. In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and implementing regulations. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the Public Health Service Act, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is more complex than the approval process for, and science behind, generic or other follow-on versions of small molecule products. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is ""highly similar"" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies. Furthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be ""interchangeable"" will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to substantial uncertainty. Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity Generally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVie’s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20 years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20 years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a “patent term restoration,” for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after 4 | 2018 Form 10-K regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years. Biological products licensed under the Public Health Service Act are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration. Pharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length, and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of market exclusivity. Applicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product is entitled upon its approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may protect a product where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods. Biologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March 23, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12 years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180 day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over, and more rigorous requirements for approval of, follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products. AbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications. These patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2019 to the late 2030s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVie’s business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark HUMIRA), are material in relation to the company’s business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in October 2018 in the majority of European Union countries. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. In addition, the following patents, licenses, and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark IMBRUVICA) and those related to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (which are sold under the trademarks MAVYRET and MAVIRET). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027. The United States composition of matter patents covering glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are expected to expire in 2032. AbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVie’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVie’s employees, consultants, advisors, contractors, and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 2018 Form 10-K | 5 Licensing and Other Arrangements In addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, and joint ventures. These licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments (if applicable), milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5 , "" Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements —Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" Third Party Agreements AbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie also maintains sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption. AbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5 , "" Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements —Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" Sources and Availability of Raw Materials AbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. AbbVie has not experienced any recent significant availability problems or supply shortages that impacted fulfillment of product demand. Research and Development Activities AbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVie’s existing portfolio. The research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases: • Phase 1—involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and potential dosing. • Phase 2—tests the drug's efficacy against the disease in a relatively small group of patients. • Phase 3—tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria. The clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar government agencies outside the United States. The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12 years and can be even longer. The research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication. 6 | 2018 Form 10-K In addition to the development of new products and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug. Regulation—Discovery and Clinical Development United States. Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Even if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be included in the NDA or BLA and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Outside the United States. AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from the applicable regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure. In Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application. The regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process. Some countries also require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to obtain regulatory approval in the country. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans). Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing The manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw 2018 Form 10-K | 7 materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. In addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie's business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight, investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. AbbVie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Political and budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie's products for the foreseeable future. United States. Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect AbbVie's business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities. In the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part D. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 50% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or ""donut hole."" The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of 8 | 2018 Form 10-K countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. AbbVie expects debate to continue during 2019 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services. AbbVie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which AbbVie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. European Union. The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products. Most governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems. Japan. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available. Emerging Markets. Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Since AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action. Environmental Matters AbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. AbbVie's capital expenditures for pollution control in 2018 were approximately $20 million and operating expenditures were approximately $31 million . In 2019 , capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately $26 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately $33 million . Abbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Some of these locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, and AbbVie has become a party to these investigations and remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which have been transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, AbbVie believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. 2018 Form 10-K | 9 Employees AbbVie employed approximately 30,000 persons as of January 31, 2019. Outside the United States, some of AbbVie's employees are represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees. Internet Information Copies of AbbVie's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after AbbVie electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). AbbVie's corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of AbbVie's audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee and public policy committee are all available on AbbVie's investor relations website ( www.abbvieinvestor.com ). ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline. Risks Related to AbbVie's Business The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products. As patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition. AbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1 , "" Business —Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity"" and Item 7 , "" Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Results of Operations,"" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3 , "" Legal Proceedings ."" The United States composition of matter patent for HUMIRA, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $19.9 billion in 2018 , expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018. 10 | 2018 Form 10-K AbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. Third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created inter partes review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged or circumvented or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. A third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition. Third parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Any significant event that adversely affects HUMIRA revenues could have a material and negative impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. HUMIRA accounted for approximately 61% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2018 . Any significant event that adversely affects HUMIRA's revenues could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection for HUMIRA, the commercialization of biosimilars of HUMIRA, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of HUMIRA for any reason. AbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of 2018 Form 10-K | 11 competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's future results of operations. Even if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer. A portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products. AbbVie depends on alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. Biologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics—including HUMIRA—could adversely impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie's biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the United States and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved. In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with AbbVie’s biologic products, including HUMIRA. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVie’s biologic products, AbbVie’s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of AbbVie’s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products. 12 | 2018 Form 10-K New products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market, and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, HUMIRA competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and AbbVie’s virology products compete with other available hepatitis C treatment options. These competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie’s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, virology/liver disease, oncology and neuroscience. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than AbbVie’s products, and this could negatively impact AbbVie’s business and results of operations. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers. The failure of these single-source suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve AbbVie's use of such alternatives. AbbVie does, however, carry business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier. Significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial condition. Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase 4 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities. Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of AbbVie's products. New data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product 2018 Form 10-K | 13 withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's products. AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product in question, lower income and exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. AbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, ""Business—Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future. AbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and United States federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, contribute to pricing pressures. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures. In numerous major markets worldwide, the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings. Rebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations. AbbVie is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. AbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in Item 1 , "" Business —Regulation—Discovery and Clinical Development."" The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs. In addition, AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and 14 | 2018 Form 10-K field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to AbbVie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of AbbVie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of AbbVie's or its suppliers' facilities while AbbVie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt AbbVie's business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. The health care industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement, rebates, price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse. In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require AbbVie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt AbbVie's business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. AbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Net revenues outside of the United States make up approximately 34% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2018 . The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States include: • fluctuations in currency exchange rates; • changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs; • multiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its products; • differing local product preferences and product requirements; • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; • difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations; • differing labor regulations; • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; • political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues; • price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action; • inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates; • potential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries, including in Europe and Latin America; and • potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and profitability. 2018 Form 10-K | 15 If AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. AbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected. AbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. AbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Additionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate. AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties. In 2018 , three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States . If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. The amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow AbbVie's business. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase. In addition, AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt. AbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. AbbVie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes. For example, it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions. AbbVie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If AbbVie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate 16 | 2018 Form 10-K funds are not available on acceptable terms, AbbVie may be unable to fund its expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect AbbVie's business. If AbbVie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may result in the failure of critical business operations or may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business. Such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from AbbVie’s or third-party providers’ databases or IT systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business harm to AbbVie and potentially substantial remediation costs. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including: • changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards and environmental laws; • differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits, stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount; • changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts; • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts; • changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie; and • changes in business, economic and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups. Risks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock AbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock. Although AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5 , "" Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities ."" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future. 2018 Form 10-K | 17 An AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in the future. In the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions, or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits plans. In addition, AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes AbbVie to issue, without the approval of AbbVie's stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over AbbVie's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as AbbVie's board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock. Certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading price of AbbVie's common stock. AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: • the inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting; • the division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term; • a provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause; • the ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on AbbVie's board of directors; and • the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80% of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock. AbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 18 | 2018 Form 10-K CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters. The words ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""project"" and similar expressions, among others, generally identify ""forward looking statements,"" which speak only as of the date the statements were made. The matters discussed in these forward looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied in the forward looking statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie or the company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 . This commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8 , "" Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ."" EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Company Overview AbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott). AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; pain associated with endometriosis; as well as other serious health conditions. AbbVie also has a pipeline of promising new medicines in clinical development across such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, products are sold primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 30,000 employees. AbbVie operates in one business segment—pharmaceutical products. 2018 Financial Results AbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2018 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $32.8 billion , operating earnings of $6.4 billion , diluted earnings per share of $3.66 and cash flows from operations of $13.4 billion . Worldwide net revenues grew by 16% , or 15% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by revenue growth related to MAVYRET, IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, and the continued strength of HUMIRA. Diluted earnings per share in 2018 was $3.66 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) a Stemcentrx-related impairment charge of $4.1 billion net of the related fair value adjustment to contingent consideration liabilities; (ii) $1.1 billion of intangible asset amortization; (iii) $500 million as a result of a collaboration agreement extension with Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico); (iv) $424 million for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); (v) $478 million for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities excluding the fair value adjustment associated with the Stemcentrx-related impairment; (vi) litigation reserve charges of $282 million ; (vii) charitable contributions of $271 million as part of AbbVie's previously announced plan to make contributions to U.S. not-for-profit organizations in 2018; and (viii) milestone payments of $137 million . 2018 financial results were also impacted by U.S. tax reform and the timing of the new legislation's phase in on certain subsidiaries. Additionally, financial results reflected continued added funding to support all stages of AbbVie’s emerging pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s growth brands. In November 2018 , AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.07 per share of common stock payable in February 2019 . This reflected an increase of approximately 11.5% over the previous quarterly dividend of $0.96 per share of common stock. 26 | 2018 Form 10-K 2019 Strategic Objectives AbbVie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) growing revenues by diversifying revenue streams, driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (ii) continued investment and expansion in its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iii) expanding operating margins; and (iv) returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials in the next twelve months. AbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through: • Hematologic oncology revenue growth from both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. • The strong execution of new product launches across multiple therapeutic areas. • HUMIRA U.S. sales growth by driving biologic penetration across disease categories and maintaining market leadership. • Effective management of HUMIRA international biosimilar erosion. • The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2019. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled ""Research and Development"" included as part of this Item 7 . AbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued leverage from revenue growth, the reduction of HUMIRA royalty expense, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses. Research and Development Research and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. AbbVie's pipeline currently includes more than 60 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology and neuroscience along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis and women's health. Of these programs, more than 30 are in mid- and late-stage development. The following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from Phase 2 development to Phase 3 development as well as developments in significant Phase 3 and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple Phase 2 programs to transition into Phase 3 programs in the next twelve months. Significant Programs and Developments Immunology Upadacitinib • In January 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted breakthrough therapy designation for upadacitinib, an investigational oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy. • In April 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 SELECT-COMPARE clinical trial evaluating upadacitinib met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are on a stable background of methotrexate and who have an inadequate response. The safety profile of upadacitinib was consistent with previously reported clinical trials and no new safety signals were detected. 2018 Form 10-K | 27 • In June 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from the Phase 3 SELECT-EARLY clinical trial evaluating upadacitinib versus methotrexate in adult patients with moderate to severe RA who were methotrexate-naïve met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints. The safety profile of upadacitinib was consistent with previously reported clinical trials and no new safety signals were detected. • In July 2018, AbbVie initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. • In September 2018, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. • In December 2018, AbbVie submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA and a marketing authorisation application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for upadacitinib for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe RA. Risankizumab • In January 2018, AbbVie initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab, an investigational interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, versus placebo during induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. • In February 2018, AbbVie announced that top-line results from two Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating risankizumab with 12-week dosing compared to ustekinumab met ranked additional secondary endpoints for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The initial results from these clinical trials were previously announced in October 2017. The safety profile was consistent with all previously reported studies, and there were no new safety signals detected across the two studies. • In April 2018, AbbVie submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for risankizumab for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults. • In May 2018, AbbVie initiated a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab versus placebo in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Oncology IMBRUVICA • In April 2018, AbbVie initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in combination with VENCLEXTA versus chlorambucil plus GAZYVA (obinutuzumab) for the first-line treatment of subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). • In May 2018, AbbVie announced that results from the Phase 3 iLLUMINATE study evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with GAZYVA in previously untreated CLL/SLL met its primary endpoint. In December 2018, AbbVie announced additional results from the Phase 3 iLLUMINATE study that demonstrated significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS). • In June 2018, AbbVie announced that results from an interim analysis of the Phase 3 iNNOVATE study evaluating IMBRUVICA plus Rituxan (rituximab) in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) met its primary endpoint. • In July 2018, AbbVie announced that results from a Phase 3 study evaluating the addition of IMBRUVICA to a chemotherapy regimen consisting of five different agents used in combination did not meet its primary endpoint in a subset of untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients identified to have the non-germinal center B-cell or activated B-cell subtypes of this disease. • In August 2018, the FDA approved IMBRUVICA, in combination with Rituxan, for the treatment of adult patients with WM. • In December 2018, AbbVie announced that results from an interim analysis of the Phase 3 ECOG1912E study evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with Rituxan versus the chemoimmunotherapy FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab) in previously untreated and younger CLL patients met its primary endpoint. • In January 2019, AbbVie announced an update on the Phase 3 RESOLVE study evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine versus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine combination in patients 28 | 2018 Form 10-K with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Results showed the study did not meet its primary endpoint of improving PFS or overall survival (OS) benefit among the study population. Safety data collected from the study were consistent with the existing safety information for the study therapies. • In January 2019, the FDA approved IMBRUVICA, in combination with GAZYVA, for adult patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL. VENCLEXTA • In January 2018, AbbVie submitted an sNDA to the FDA for VENCLEXTA monotherapy in patients with CLL who are refractory to or have relapsed B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors. • In June 2018, the FDA approved VENCLEXTA in combination with Rituxan for the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL, with or without 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior therapy. VENCLEXTA plus Rituxan is the first oral-based, chemotherapy-free combination in CLL that allows patients an option for fixed treatment duration. • In September 2018, the FDA expanded the label for VENCLEXTA in combination with Rituxan to include information about patients with previously-treated CLL who achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity in the Phase 3 MURANO trial. • In October 2018, the European Commission approved the type-II variation application for VENCLYXTO in combination with Rituxan for the treatment of patients with R/R CLL who have received at least one prior therapy. In November, AbbVie received notification from the European Commission that conditions of the original conditional marketing authorisation have been fulfilled, granting VENCLYXTO official receipt of approval. • In October 2018, AbbVie announced that the results from the Phase 3 CLL14 study comparing the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA plus obinutuzumab versus obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with CLL and coexisting medical conditions met its primary endpoint. • In November 2018, the FDA granted accelerated approval for VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low dose cytarabine (LDAC) for the treatment of newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults who are age 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rates. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Rova-T • In March 2018, AbbVie announced top-line results from the Phase 2 TRINITY study evaluating rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) for third-line R/R small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Although Rova-T demonstrated single agent responses in advanced SCLC patients, after consulting with the FDA, based on the magnitude of effect across multiple parameters in this single-arm study, the company will not seek accelerated approval for Rova-T in third-line R/R SCLC. • In December 2018, AbbVie announced the decision to stop enrollment for the TAHOE trial, a Phase 3 study evaluating Rova-T as a second-line therapy for advanced SCLC. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping enrollment in TAHOE due to shorter overall survival in the Rova-T arm compared with the topotecan control arm.

Galapagos will not pursue further research and development in CF, but is eligible for future milestones and royalties on commercialized programs. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Revenues The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and the current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.

Global HUMIRA sales increased 7% in 2018 and 14% in 2017 . The sales increases in 2018 and 2017 were driven primarily by market growth across therapeutic categories and geographies as well as favorable pricing in certain geographies. In the United States, HUMIRA sales increased 11% in 2018 and 18% in 2017 . The sales increase in 2018 and 2017 was driven by market growth across all indications and favorable pricing. Internationally, HUMIRA revenues increased 1% in 2018 and 7% in 2017 . The sales increase in 2018 was driven primarily by market growth across indications partially offset by direct biosimilar competition in Europe following the expiration of the European Union composition of matter patent for adalimumab in October 2018. Due to the entry of biosimilar competition, AbbVie expects international HUMIRA net revenues to decline in 2019. Biosimilar competition for HUMIRA is not expected in the United States until 2023. AbbVie continues to pursue strategies intended to further differentiate HUMIRA from competing products and add to the sustainability of HUMIRA. Net revenues for IMBRUVICA represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of IMBRUVICA profit. AbbVie's global IMBRUVICA revenues increased 39% in 2018 and 40% in 2017 as a result of continued penetration of IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL as well as favorable pricing. Net revenues for VENCLEXTA increased by more than 100% in 2018 primarily due to market share gains following FDA and EMA approvals of VENCLEXTA in combination with Rituxan for certain patients with R/R CLL. Global MAVYRET sales increased by more than 100% in 2018 as a result of market share gains following the FDA and EMA approvals of MAVYRET in the second half of 2017 as well as further geographic expansion in 2018. Global VIEKIRA sales decreased by 76% in 2018 and 49% in 2017 primarily due to lower market share following the launch of MAVYRET. Net revenues for Creon increased 12% in 2018 and 14% in 2017 , driven primarily by continued market growth, higher market share and favorable pricing. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market. AndroGel net revenues decreased 19% in 2018 and 14% in 2017 primarily due to market contraction and the entry of generic competition for the AndroGel 1.62% formulation in October 2018. AbbVie expects net revenues for AndroGel to continue to decline in 2019. Net revenues for Duodopa increased 18% in 2018 and 20% in 2017 , primarily as a result of market penetration. Gross Margin Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Gross margin $ 25,035 $ 21,174 $ 19,806 18 % 7 % as a percent of net revenues 76 % 75 % 77 % Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to the reduction of HUMIRA royalty expense and a 2017 intangible asset impairment charge of $354 million partially offset by the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2017 decreased from 2016 primarily due to an intangible asset impairment charge of $354 million in 2017, as well as the unfavorable impacts of higher intangible asset amortization and the IMBRUVICA profit sharing arrangement. These drivers were partially offset by lower amortization of the fair market value step-up of acquisition-date inventory of Pharmacyclics as well as favorable changes in product mix and operational efficiencies. Selling, General and Administrative Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Selling, general and administrative $ 7,399 $ 6,295 $ 5,881 18 % 7 % as a percent of net revenues 23 % 22 % 23 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of new product launch expenses and charitable contributions of $350 million to 32 | 2018 Form 10-K select U.S. not-for-profit organizations in 2018 as part of AbbVie's previously announced plan partially offset by continued leverage from revenue growth. SG&A expense percentage in 2017 decreased from 2016 . SG&A expense percentage in 2017 was favorably impacted by continued leverage from revenue growth partially offset by litigation reserves charges that increased by $370 million in 2017 compared to the prior year and new product launch expenses. Research and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development Percent change years ended December 31 (dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Research and development $ 10,329 $ 5,007 $ 4,385 >100% 14 % as a percent of net revenues 32 % 18 % 17 % Acquired in-process research and development $ 424 $ 327 $ 200 30 % 64 % Research and Development (R&D) expenses in 2018 increased from 2017 principally due to a $5.1 billion intangible asset impairment charge related to IPR&D acquired as part of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition following the decision to stop enrollment in the TAHOE trial. The impairment was primarily due to lower probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets obtained in the acquisition. The remaining increase reflected greater funding to support all stages of the company's pipeline assets. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge. R&D expenses in 2017 increased from 2016 principally due to increased funding to support all stages of the company’s pipeline assets, the impact of the post-acquisition R&D expenses of Stemcentrx and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) compounds and an increase in development milestones of $63 million . These factors were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related costs of $135 million . Acquired IPR&D expenses reflect upfront payments related to various collaborations. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2018. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2017 included a charge of $205 million as a result of entering into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. There were no individually significant transactions or cash flows during 2016. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Alector agreement. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses in 2018 included a $500 million charge related to the extension of the previously announced Calico collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. Other Non-Operating Expenses years ended December 31 (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Interest expense $ 1,348 $ 1,150 $ 1,047 Interest income (204 ) (146 ) (82 ) Interest expense, net $ 1,144 $ 1,004 $ 965 Net foreign exchange loss $ 24 $ 348 $ 303 Other expense, net 18 466 188 Interest expense in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of higher interest rates on the company's debt obligations and a higher average outstanding debt balance during 2018. Interest expense in 2017 increased compared to 2016 due to a full year of expense associated with the May 2016 issuance of $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes which were issued primarily to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and to repay an outstanding term loan. Interest income in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher interest rates. Interest income in 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in the company’s investment securities. 2018 Form 10-K | 33 Net foreign exchange loss in 2017 included $316 million of historical currency translation losses that were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Net foreign exchange loss in 2016 included losses totaling $298 million related to the devaluation of AbbVie’s net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Venezuelan devaluation. Other expense, net included charges related to the change in fair value of the BI and Stemcentrx contingent consideration liabilities of $49 million in 2018 , $626 million in 2017 and $228 million in 2016 . The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development and other market-based factors. In 2018 , the BI contingent consideration liability increased due to the passage of time and higher estimated future sales partially offset by the effect of rising interest rates. The increase in the BI contingent consideration liability was primarily offset by a $428 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability recorded during the fourth quarter of 2018 due to a reduction in probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets obtained in the acquisition. In 2017 , the change in fair value represented mainly higher probabilities of success, the passage of time and declining interest rates. In 2016 , the change in fair value represented mainly the passage of time, as increases to the BI contingent consideration liability due to higher probabilities of success were fully offset by the effects of rising interest rates and changes in other market-based assumptions. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisitions of Stemcentrx and BI compounds. Other expense, net for 2017 also included realized gains on available-for-sale investment securities of $90 million. Income Tax Expense The effective income tax rate was negative 9% in 2018 , was 31% in 2017 and was 24% in 2016 . The effective tax rate in each period differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and business development activities. The effective tax rate for 2018 reflects the impact of the effective date of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) related to the earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and the effects of Stemcentrx intangible impairment related expenses. Given these factors, the effective income tax rate may change significantly in future periods. The effective tax rate in 2017 included tax expense of $4.5 billion on the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by a $3.6 billion net tax benefit for the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Act and foreign tax law changes. The Act significantly changed the U.S. corporate tax system. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and created a territorial tax system that included new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Act. The effective tax rate in 2016 included additional expense of $187 million related to the recognition of the tax effect of regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on December 7, 2016 that changed the determination of the U.S. taxability of foreign currency gains and losses related to certain foreign operations. FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES years ended December 31 (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Cash flows from: Operating activities $ 13,427 $ 9,960 $ 7,041 Investing activities (1,006 ) (274 ) (6,074 ) Financing activities (14,396 ) (5,512 ) (3,928 ) Operating cash flows in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to improved results of operations from revenue growth and a decrease in income tax payments. Operating cash flows in 2017 increased from 2016 primarily due to improved results of operations resulting from revenue growth, an improvement in operating earnings and a decrease in income tax payments. Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $78 million in 2018 and $71 million in 2017 and were presented within operating cash flows as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. Prior to the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement, realized excess benefits of $55 million in 2016 were presented within cash flows from financing activities. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie’s contributions to its defined benefit plans of $873 million in 2018, $246 million in 2017 and $273 million in 2016. 34 | 2018 Form 10-K Investing cash flows in 2018 included payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $736 million and capital expenditures of $638 million , partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $368 million . Investing cash flows in 2017 included capital expenditures of $529 million and payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $308 million , partially offset by net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $563 million . Investing cash flows in 2016 primarily included $1.9 billion of cash consideration paid to acquire Stemcentrx in June 2016, a $595 million upfront payment to acquire certain rights from BI in April 2016, net purchases of investment securities totaling $3.0 billion and capital expenditures of $479 million . In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. The balance of commercial paper outstanding was $699 million as of December 31, 2018 and $400 million as of December 31, 2017 . AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed. Financing cash flows in 2018 also included proceeds from the issuance of a $3.0 billion 364 -day term loan credit agreement (term loan) entered into in May 2018 . In June 2018, the company drew on this term loan and as of December 31, 2018 , $3.0 billion was outstanding and was included in short-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet. Borrowings under the term loan bear interest at one month LIBOR plus applicable margin. The term loan may be prepaid without penalty upon prior notice and contains customary covenants, all of which the company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2018 . In September 2018, the company issued $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. Of the $5.9 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the company's outstanding three-year term loan credit agreement in September 2018 and $1.0 billion was used to repay the aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior notes at maturity in November 2018. The company intends to use the remaining proceeds to repay term loan obligations in 2019 as they become due. Financing cash flows in 2018 also included the May 2018 repayment of $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 1.80% senior notes at maturity. In November 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes. The company used the proceeds to redeem $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% senior notes that were due to mature in November 2017. In May 2016, the company issued $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. Approximately $2.0 billion of the net proceeds were used to repay an outstanding term loan that was due to mature in November 2016, approximately $1.9 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and approximately $3.8 billion of the net proceeds were used to finance an accelerated share repurchase (ASR). See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the 2016 ASR transaction. Cash dividend payments totaled $5.6 billion in 2018 , $4.1 billion in 2017 and $3.7 billion in 2016 . The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase in the dividend rate. On November 2, 2018, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.96 per share to $1.07 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February 15, 2019 to stockholders of record as of January 15, 2019. This reflects an increase of approximately 11.5% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. On December 13, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. The new stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased approximately 109 million shares for $10.7 billion in 2018. AbbVie cash-settled $201 million of its December 2018 open market purchases in January 2019. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 . Under previous stock repurchase programs, AbbVie made open market share repurchases of approximately 11 million shares for $1.3 billion in 2018, approximately 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in 2017 and approximately 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in 2016 . AbbVie cash-settled $285 million of its December 2016 open market purchases in January 2017 and cash-settled $300 million of its December 2015 open market purchases in January 2016. In 2018, AbbVie paid $100 million of contingent consideration to BI related to BLA and MAA acceptance milestones. $78 million of these payments were included in financing cash flows and $22 million of the payments were included in operating cash flows. In 2017, AbbVie paid $305 million of contingent consideration to BI related to a Phase 3 enrollment milestone. $268 million of this milestone was included in financing cash flows and $37 million was included in operating cash flows. 2018 Form 10-K | 35 Cash and equivalents were impacted by net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $39 million in 2018 , net favorable exchange rate changes totaling $29 million in 2017 and net unfavorable exchange rate changes totaling $338 million in 2016 . The unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2018 were primarily due to the weakening of the Euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. The favorable exchange rate changes in 2017 were primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro and other foreign currencies on the translation of the company's Euro-denominated assets and cash denominated in foreign currencies. The unfavorable exchange rate changes in 2016 were primarily due to the devaluation of AbbVie's net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar. Credit Risk AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. Global economic conditions and customer-specific factors may require the company to periodically re-evaluate the collectability of its receivables and the company could potentially incur credit losses. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables. Credit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings Credit Facility In August 2018, AbbVie replaced its existing revolving credit facility with a new $3.0 billion five -year revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2018 , the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Access to Capital The company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives. Credit Ratings There were no changes in the company’s credit ratings during 2018 . Unfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company's ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company's outstanding debt obligations. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 : (in millions) Total Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Short-term borrowings $ 3,699 $ 3,699 $ — $ — $ — Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, including current portion 37,360 1,612 6,808 6,370 22,570 Interest on long-term debt (a) 17,204 1,433 2,613 2,024 11,134 Future minimum non-cancelable operating lease commitments 809 116 205 145 343 Purchase obligations and other (b) 1,843 1,710 110 21 2 Other long-term liabilities (c) (d) (e) (f) 9,994 736 1,392 1,478 6,388 Total $ 70,909 $ 9,306 $ 11,128 $ 10,038 $ 40,437 36 | 2018 Form 10-K (a) Includes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2018 . Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2018 . See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 10 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2018 . (b) Includes the company's significant unconditional purchase obligations. These commitments do not exceed the company's projected requirements and are made in the normal course of business. (c) Amounts less than one year includes a voluntary contribution of $150 million that AbbVie made to its principal domestic defined benefit plan subsequent to December 31, 2018 . Amounts otherwise exclude pension and other post-employment benefits and related deferred compensation cash outflows. Timing of future funding is uncertain and dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns, changes in laws and regulations and other variables. Also included in this amount are components of other long-term liabilities including restructuring. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring and Note 11 for additional information on the pension and other post-employment benefit plans. (d) Excludes liabilities associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits as it is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits. (e) Includes $4.5 billion of contingent consideration liabilities primarily related to the acquisition of BI compounds which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Notes 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. (f) Includes a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these tax liabilities. AbbVie enters into R&D collaboration arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As a result, these potential payments are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. 2018 Form 10-K | 37 Rebates AbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Rebates and chargebacks totaled $16.4 billion in 2018 , $12.9 billion in 2017 and $10.8 billion in 2016 . Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. In order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings. The following table is an analysis of the three largest rebate accruals and chargeback allowances, which comprise approximately 91% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2018 . Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings. (in millions) Medicaid and Medicare Rebates Managed Care Rebates Wholesaler Chargebacks Balance at December 31, 2015 $ 1,032 $ 920 $ 363 Provisions 2,606 3,146 3,987 Payments (2,471 ) (2,899 ) (3,967 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 1,167 1,167 383 Provisions 2,909 3,990 5,026 Payments (2,736 ) (3,962 ) (4,887 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 1,340 1,195 522 Provisions 3,493 4,729 6,659 Payments (3,188 ) (4,485 ) (6,525 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,645 $ 1,439 $ 656 Cash Discounts and Product Returns Cash discounts and product returns, which totaled $1.6 billion in 2018 , $1.3 billion in 2017 and $964 million in 2016 , are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience. Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 38 | 2018 Form 10-K The discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December 31 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e. duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. Beginning in 2016, AbbVie also reflected the plans' specific cash flows and applied them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. AbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December 31, 2018 . A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2019 and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018 : 50 basis point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease Defined benefit plans Service and interest cost $ (54 ) $ 64 Projected benefit obligation (512 ) 578 Other post-employment plans Service and interest cost $ (2 ) $ 4 Projected benefit obligation (47 ) 54 The expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2018 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2019 . A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2019 by $62 million . The health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2018 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2019 . A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2019 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 : One percentage point (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease Service and interest cost $ 17 $ (9 ) Projected benefit obligation 110 (87 ) Income Taxes AbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Litigation The company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum 2018 Form 10-K | 39 loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets AbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Annually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Contingent Consideration The fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2018 , a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $160 million . Additionally, at December 31, 2018 , a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $420 million .

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies. Foreign Currency Risk AbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 : 2018 2017 (in millions) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Contract amount Weighted average exchange rate Fair and carrying value receivable/(payable) Receive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies: Euro $ 6,660 1.157 $ 68 $ 6,366 1.175 $ (88 ) Japanese yen 1,076 111.5 (12 ) 940 112.4 2 British pound 499 1.328 21 760 1.310 (22 ) All other currencies 1,776 n/a 29 1,877 n/a (18 ) Total $ 10,011 $ 106 $ 9,943 $ (126 ) The company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.0 billion at December 31, 2018 . If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies. In November 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company has designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the senior Euro note issuance and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the net investment hedging program. Interest Rate Risk The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $403 million at December 31, 2018 . If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $2.4 billion at December 31, 2018 . A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. Market Price Risk AbbVie’s debt securities investment portfolio (the portfolio) is its main exposure to market price risk. The portfolio is subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. It is AbbVie’s policy to mitigate market price risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure to a particular issuer and security type while placing limits on the amount of time to maturity. AbbVie’s investment policy limits investments to investment grade credit ratings. The company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would decrease the fair value of the portfolio by approximately $16 million as of December 31, 2018 . If the portfolio were to be liquidated, the fair value reduction would affect the statement of earnings in the period sold. 2018 Form 10-K | 41 ITEM 8.

(AbbVie or the company) is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. Outside the United States, products are sold primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012. On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent, publicly-traded company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for rebates, pension and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, litigation, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, contingent consideration liabilities, financial instruments and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AbbVie and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, where AbbVie is determined to be the primary beneficiary. Investments in companies over which AbbVie has a significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method with AbbVie's share of earnings or losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period consolidated financial statements to the current period presentation. Revenue Recognition AbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. The company recognizes shipping and handling costs as an expense in cost of products sold when the company transfers control to the customer. Payment terms vary depending on the type and location of the customer, are based on customary commercial terms and are generally less than one year. AbbVie does not adjust revenue for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts where AbbVie expects the period between the transfer of the good or service and collection to be one year or less. Discounts, rebates, sales incentives to customers, returns and certain other adjustments are accounted for as variable consideration. Provisions for variable consideration are based on current pricing, executed contracts, government pricing legislation and historical data and are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant. Sales incentives to customers are insignificant. 48 | 2018 Form 10-K In addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 15 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography. Research and Development Expenses Internal research and development (R&D) costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development collaborations, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product. Collaborations and Other Arrangements The company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include joint research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements during the development stage are expensed to acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. Subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of milestones during the development stage are expensed to R&D expense in the consolidated statements of earnings when the milestone is achieved. Milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred. Advertising Costs associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $1.1 billion in 2018 , $846 million in 2017 and $764 million in 2016 . Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans based on calculations which utilize various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, rates of return on assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. AbbVie reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Actuarial gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI), net of tax and are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized to net periodic benefit cost over a five -year period. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents include money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Investments Investments consist primarily of time deposits, marketable debt securities, held-to-maturity debt securities and equity securities. Investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets until realized, at which time the gains or losses are recognized in earnings. Investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. Held-to- 2018 Form 10-K | 49 maturity debt securities are recorded at cost. Gains or losses on investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie periodically assesses its marketable debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment losses. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below the cost basis and adverse conditions related specifically to the security, including any changes to the credit rating of the security, intent to sell, or whether AbbVie will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. AbbVie also considers industry factors and general market trends. When AbbVie determines that an other-than-temporary decline has occurred, the cost basis of the investment is written down with a charge to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and an available-for-sale investment's unrealized loss is reclassified from AOCI to other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed using the first-in, first-out method adjusted for any other-than-temporary declines in fair value that were recorded in net earnings. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information. Accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $51 million at December 31, 2018 and $58 million at December 31, 2017 . Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Cost includes material and conversion costs. Inventories consisted of the following: as of December 31 (in millions) 2018 2017 Finished goods $ 473 $ 610 Work-in-process 862 822 Raw materials 270 173 Inventories $ 1,605 $ 1,605 Property and Equipment as of December 31 (in millions) 2018 2017 Land $ 73 $ 48 Buildings 1,603 1,428 Equipment 6,362 5,991 Construction in progress 358 604 Property and equipment, gross 8,396 8,071 Less accumulated depreciation (5,513 ) (5,268 ) Property and equipment, net $ 2,883 $ 2,803 Depreciation for property and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life for buildings ranges from 10 to 50 years. Buildings include leasehold improvements which are amortized over the life of the related facility lease (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the asset, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful life for equipment ranges from 2 to 25 years. Equipment includes certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use and is amortized over 3 to 10 years. Depreciation expense was $471 million in 2018 , $425 million in 2017 and $425 million in 2016 . Assets related to capital leases were insignificant at December 31, 2018 and 2017 . Litigation and Contingencies Loss contingency provisions are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. When a best estimate cannot be made, the minimum loss contingency amount in a probable range is recorded. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. AbbVie accrues for product liability claims on an undiscounted basis. The liabilities are evaluated quarterly and adjusted if necessary as additional information 50 | 2018 Form 10-K becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims, if any, are recorded as assets on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. Business Combinations AbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that r esults of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital and terminal values of market participants. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the estimated pattern of economic benefit. AbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. AbbVie first compares the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are subject to an impairment review annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. An impairment of goodwill could occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. An impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets would occur if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. For its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates. Acquired In-Process Research and Development In an asset acquisition, the initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects acquired are expensed as IPR&D in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. In a business combination, the fair value of IPR&D projects acquired are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&D costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency Translation Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are 2018 Form 10-K | 51 remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. For derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. The company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI. Derivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2014-09 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Summary and Amendments That Create Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40) . The amendments in this standard superseded most existing revenue recognition requirements. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2017 have been presented in accordance with the standard, while results for prior periods have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with AbbVie’s historical accounting. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. There were no significant changes to the amounts or timing of revenue recognition for product sales, the company's primary revenue stream. For certain licensing arrangements where revenue was previously deferred and recognized over time, revenue is now recognized at the point in time when the license is granted. Additionally, for certain contract manufacturing arrangements where revenue was previously recognized at a point in time at the end of the manufacturing process, revenue is now recognized over time throughout the manufacturing process. Under the new standard, on January 1, 2018, the company recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings primarily related to certain deferred license revenues that were originally expected to be recognized through early 2020. The adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet included: (i) a $42 million increase to prepaid expenses and other; (ii) a $39 million decrease to inventories; (iii) a $57 million decrease to accounts payable and accrued liabilities; (iv) a $75 million decrease to other long-term liabilities; (v) a $22 million increase to deferred income taxes; and (vi) a $124 million increase to retained earnings. Other cumulative-effect adjustments to the consolidated balance sheet were insignificant. 52 | 2018 Form 10-K The impact of adoption on the company’s consolidated statements of earnings in 2018 was as follows: year ended December 31, 2018 (in millions, except per share data) As Reported Balances Without Adoption of ASU 2014-09 Effect of Change Higher/(Lower) Net revenues $ 32,753 $ 32,812 $ (59 ) Cost of products sold 7,718 7,730 (12 ) Income tax benefit (490 ) (487 ) (3 ) Net earnings 5,687 5,731 (44 ) Diluted earnings per share $ 3.66 $ 3.69 $ (0.03 ) As of December 31, 2018 , due to the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09, prepaid expenses and other were $40 million higher, inventories were $27 million lower, accounts payable and accrued liabilities were $53 million lower, other long-term liabilities were $18 million lower, deferred income taxes were $11 million higher and retained earnings were $80 million higher on the company’s consolidated balance sheet than they would have been had ASU 2014-09 not been adopted. Other impacts to the consolidated balance sheet were insignificant. ASU No. 2016-01 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . The standard requires several targeted changes including that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018. The adoption did not impact the accounting for AbbVie's investments in debt securities and did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2016-16 In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory . The standard requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Under previous U.S. GAAP, the income tax consequences of these intercompany asset transfers were deferred until the asset was sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method. As a result, on January 1, 2018, the company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to its consolidated balance sheet that included a $1.9 billion decrease to retained earnings, a $1.4 billion decrease to prepaid expenses and other and a $0.5 billion decrease to other assets. ASU No. 2017-07 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost . The standard requires that an employer continue to report the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item or items as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. The other components of net periodic benefit cost are required to be presented separately outside of income from operations and are not eligible for capitalization. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 and applied the income statement classification provisions of this standard retrospectively. As a result, the company reclassified income of $47 million from operating earnings to non-operating income in 2017 and $44 million in 2016. Additionally, the company recorded approximately $34 million of non-operating income in 2018 which would have been recorded in operating earnings under the previous guidance. ASU No. 2017-12 In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The standard simplifies the application of hedge accounting and more closely aligns the accounting with an entity’s risk management activities. AbbVie elected to early adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements. 2018 Form 10-K | 53 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted ASU No. 2016-02 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . The standard outlines a comprehensive lease accounting model that supersedes the current lease guidance and requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also changes the definition of a lease and expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. AbbVie has substantially completed its assessment of the new standard as of December 31, 2018. AbbVie will adopt the standard effective in the first quarter of 2019 and will not restate comparative periods upon adoption. AbbVie will elect a package of practical expedients for leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019 and will not reassess: (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; (ii) lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and (iii) initial direct costs capitalization for any existing leases. AbbVie does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated statement of earnings. However, the new standard will require AbbVie to establish liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on its consolidated balance sheet of approximately $0.3 billion to $0.5 billion for operating leases that exist as of the adoption date. ASU No. 2016-13 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) . The standard changes how credit losses are measured for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, the standard requires the use of a new forward-looking ""expected credit loss"" model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the standard now requires allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. Additionally, the standard requires new disclosures and will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2020. Early adoption beginning in the first quarter of 2019 is permitted. With certain exceptions, adjustments are to be applied using a modified-retrospective approach by reflecting adjustments through a cumulative-effect impact to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact and timing of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2018-02 In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for stranded tax effects related to adjustments to deferred taxes resulting from the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The standard will be effective for AbbVie starting with the first quarter of 2019. AbbVie is currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 54 | 2018 Form 10-K Note 3 Supplemental Financial Information Interest Expense, Net years ended December 31 (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Interest expense $ 1,348 $ 1,150 $ 1,047 Interest income (204 ) (146 ) (82 ) Interest expense, net $ 1,144 $ 1,004 $ 965 Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2018 2017 Sales rebates $ 3,939 $ 3,069 Dividends payable 1,607 1,143 Accounts payable 1,546 1,474 Salaries, wages and commissions 787 763 Royalty and license arrangements 304 514 Other 3,748 3,263 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 11,931 $ 10,226 Other Long-Term Liabilities as of December 31 (in millions) 2018 2017 Income taxes payable $ 4,311 $ 4,675 Contingent consideration liabilities 4,306 4,266 Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 2,726 2,683 Pension and other post-employment benefits 1,840 2,740 Other 1,307 1,241 Other long-term liabilities $ 14,490 $ 15,605 Note 4 Earnings Per Share AbbVie grants certain restricted stock awards (RSAs) and restricted stock units (RSUs) that are considered to be participating securities. Due to the presence of participating securities, AbbVie calculates earnings per share (EPS) using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For all periods presented, the two-class method was more dilutive. 2018 Form 10-K | 55 The following table summarizes the impact of the two-class method: Years ended December 31, (in millions, except per share information) 2018 2017 2016 Basic EPS Net earnings $ 5,687 $ 5,309 $ 5,953 Earnings allocated to participating securities 30 26 30 Earnings available to common shareholders $ 5,657 $ 5,283 $ 5,923 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 1,541 1,596 1,622 Basic earnings per share $ 3.67 $ 3.31 $ 3.65 Diluted EPS Net earnings $ 5,687 $ 5,309 $ 5,953 Earnings allocated to participating securities 30 26 30 Earnings available to common shareholders $ 5,657 $ 5,283 $ 5,923 Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 1,541 1,596 1,622 Effect of dilutive securities 5 7 9 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 1,546 1,603 1,631 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.66 $ 3.30 $ 3.63 As further described in Note 12 , AbbVie entered into and executed an accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) with a third party financial institution in 2016. For purposes of calculating EPS, AbbVie reflected the ASR as a repurchase of AbbVie common stock. Certain shares issuable under stock-based compensation plans were excluded from the computation of EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive. The number of common shares excluded was insignificant for all periods presented. Note 5 Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements Acquisition of Stemcentrx On June 1, 2016, AbbVie acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Stemcentrx, a privately-held biotechnology company. The transaction expanded AbbVie’s oncology pipeline by adding the late-stage asset rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), four additional early-stage clinical compounds in solid tumor indications and a significant portfolio of pre-clinical assets. Rova-T is currently in registrational trials for small cell lung cancer. The acquisition of Stemcentrx was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The aggregate upfront consideration for the acquisition of Stemcentrx consisted of approximately 62.4 million shares of AbbVie common stock, issued from common stock held in treasury, and cash. AbbVie may make certain contingent payments upon the achievement of defined development and regulatory milestones. As of the acquisition date, the maximum aggregate amount payable for development and regulatory milestones was $4.0 billion . The acquisition-date fair value of these milestones was $620 million and was estimated using a combination of probability-weighted discounted cash flow models and Monte Carlo simulation models. The estimate was determined based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, referred to as Level 3 inputs, as described in more detail in Note 10 . The following table summarizes total consideration: (in millions) Cash $ 1,883 Fair value of AbbVie common stock 3,923 Contingent consideration 620 Total consideration $ 6,426 56 | 2018 Form 10-K The following table summarizes fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the June 1, 2016 acquisition date: (in millions) Assets acquired and liabilities assumed Accounts receivable $ 1 Prepaid expenses and other 7 Property and equipment 17 Intangible assets - Indefinite-lived research and development 6,100 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (31 ) Deferred income taxes (1,933 ) Other long-term liabilities (7 ) Total identifiable net assets 4,154 Goodwill 2,272 Total assets acquired and liabilities assumed $ 6,426 Intangible assets were related to IPR&D for Rova-T, four additional early-stage clinical compounds in solid tumor indications and several additional pre-clinical compounds. The estimated fair value of the acquired IPR&D was determined using the multi-period excess earnings model of the “income approach,” which is a valuation technique that provides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful life. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of those asset valuations include the estimated annual cash flows for each asset or product (including net revenues, cost of sales, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs and working capital/contributory asset charges), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset’s life cycle, the regulatory approval probabilities, commercial success risks, competitive landscape as well as other factors. See Note 7 for additional information on the 2018 partial impairment of Stemcentrx-related intangible assets. The goodwill recognized represented expected synergies, including the ability to: (i) leverage the respective strengths of each business; (ii) expand the combined company’s product portfolio; (iii) accelerate AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology; and (iv) establish a strong leadership position in oncology. Goodwill was also impacted by the establishment of a deferred tax liability for the acquired identifiable intangible assets which have no tax basis. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Following the acquisition date, the operating results of Stemcentrx have been included in the company's financial statements. AbbVie’s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 included no net revenues and an operating loss of $165 million associated with Stemcentrx's operations. This operating loss included $43 million of post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense for Stemcentrx options and excluded interest expense and certain acquisition costs. Pro Forma Financial Information The following table presents the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations of AbbVie and Stemcentrx for the year ended December 31, 2016 as if the acquisition of Stemcentrx had occurred on January 1, 2015: year ended December 31 (in millions, except per share information) 2016 Net revenues $ 25,641 Net earnings 5,907 Basic earnings per share $ 3.58 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.56 The unaudited pro forma financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of AbbVie and Stemcentrx. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2015 as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect the additional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition and the reclassification of acquisition, integration and financing-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2018 Form 10-K | 57 2015. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2015. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of the future results of operations of the combined company nor does it reflect the expected realization of any cost savings or synergies associated with the acquisition. Acquisition of BI 655066 and BI 655064 from Boehringer Ingelheim On April 1, 2016, AbbVie acquired all rights to risankizumab (BI 655066), an anti-IL-23 monoclonal biologic antibody in Phase 3 development for psoriasis, from Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) pursuant to a global collaboration agreement. AbbVie is also evaluating the potential of this biologic therapy in other indications, including Crohn’s disease, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. In addition to risankizumab, AbbVie also gained rights to an anti-CD40 antibody, BI 655064, currently in Phase 1 development. BI will retain responsibility for further development of BI 655064, and AbbVie may elect to advance the program after completion of certain clinical achievements. The acquired assets include all patents, data, know-how, third-party agreements, regulatory filings and manufacturing technology related to BI 655066 and BI 655064. The company concluded that the acquired assets met the definition of a business and accounted for the transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie made an upfront payment of $595 million . Additionally, $18 million of payments to BI, pursuant to a contractual obligation to reimburse BI for certain development costs it incurred prior to the acquisition date, were initially deferred. AbbVie may make certain contingent payments upon the achievement of defined development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalty payments based on net revenues of licensed products. As of the acquisition date, the maximum aggregate amount payable for development and regulatory milestones was approximately $1.6 billion . The acquisition-date fair value of these milestones was $606 million . The acquisition-date fair value of contingent royalty payments was $2.8 billion . The potential contingent consideration payments were estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which were then discounted to present value. The fair value measurements were based on Level 3 inputs. The following table summarizes total consideration: (in millions) Cash $ 595 Deferred consideration payable 18 Contingent consideration 3,365 Total consideration $ 3,978 The following table summarizes fair values of assets acquired as of the April 1, 2016 acquisition date: (in millions) Assets acquired Identifiable intangible assets - Indefinite-lived research and development $ 3,890 Goodwill 88 Total assets acquired $ 3,978 The estimated fair value of the acquired IPR&D was determined using the multi-period excess earnings model of the “income approach.” The goodwill recognized represented expected synergies, including an expansion of the company’s immunology product portfolio. Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented because this acquisition was insignificant to AbbVie’s consolidated results of operations. Other Licensing & Acquisitions Activity Excluding the acquisitions above, cash outflows related to other acquisitions and investments totaled $736 million in 2018 , $308 million in 2017 and $262 million in 2016 . AbbVie recorded acquired IPR&D charges of $424 million in 2018 , $327 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2016 . Significant arrangements impacting 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , some of which require contingent milestone payments, are summarized below. 58 | 2018 Form 10-K Calico Life Sciences LLC In June 2018, AbbVie and Calico Life Sciences LLC (Calico) entered into an extension of a collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie and Calico will each contribute an additional $500 million to the collaboration and the term is extended for an additional 3 years . Calico will be responsible for research and early development until 2022 and will advance collaboration projects through Phase 2a through 2027. Following completion of Phase 2a, AbbVie will have the option to exclusively license collaboration compounds. AbbVie will support Calico in its early research and development efforts and, upon exercise, would be responsible for late-stage development and commercial activities. Collaboration costs and profits will be shared equally by both parties post option exercise. During 2018 , AbbVie recorded $500 million in other expense in the consolidated statement of earnings related to its commitments under the agreement. Alector, Inc. In October 2017, AbbVie entered into a global strategic collaboration with Alector, Inc. (Alector) to develop and commercialize medicines to treat Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. AbbVie and Alector have agreed to research a portfolio of antibody targets and AbbVie has an option to global development and commercial rights to two targets. The terms of the arrangement included an initial upfront payment of $205 million , which was expensed to IPR&D in the fourth quarter of 2017. Alector will conduct exploratory research, drug discovery and development for lead programs up to the conclusion of the proof of concept studies. If the option is exercised, AbbVie will lead development and commercialization activities and could make additional payments to Alector of up to $986 million upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. Alector and AbbVie will co-fund development and commercialization and will share global profits equally. Other Arrangements In addition to the significant arrangements described above, AbbVie entered into several other arrangements resulting in charges to IPR&D of $424 million in 2018 , $122 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2016 . In connection with the other individually insignificant early-stage arrangements entered into in 2018 , AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $4.8 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Note 6 Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc. In December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of IMBRUVICA, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and certain compounds structurally related to IMBRUVICA, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States. The collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize IMBRUVICA outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40% of collaboration development costs. In the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of IMBRUVICA are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share. Outside the United States, Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize IMBRUVICA. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. AbbVie's share of profits is included in AbbVie's net revenues. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share. 2018 Form 10-K | 59 The following table shows the profit and cost sharing relationship between Janssen and AbbVie: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 United States - Janssen's share of profits (included in cost of products sold) $ 1,372 $ 1,001 $ 735 International - AbbVie's share of profits (included in net revenues) 622 429 252 Global - AbbVie's share of other costs (included in respective line items) 326 288 262 AbbVie’s receivable from Janssen, included in accounts receivable, net, was $177 million at December 31, 2018 and $124 million at December 31, 2017 . AbbVie’s payable to Janssen, included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, was $376 million at December 31, 2018 and $253 million at December 31, 2017 . Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill: (in millions) Balance as of December 31, 2016 $ 15,416 Foreign currency translation 369 Balance as of December 31, 2017 15,785 Foreign currency translation (122 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 15,663 The latest impairment assessment of goodwill was completed in the third quarter of 2018 . As of December 31, 2018 , there were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses. Future impairment tests for goodwill will be performed annually in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. Intangible Assets, Net The following table summarizes intangible assets: 2018 2017 as of December 31 (in millions) Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net carrying amount Definite-lived intangible assets Developed product rights $ 15,872 $ (5,614 ) $ 10,258 $ 16,138 $ (4,982 ) $ 11,156 License agreements 7,865 (1,810 ) 6,055 7,822 (1,409 ) 6,413 Total definite-lived intangible assets 23,737 (7,424 ) 16,313 23,960 (6,391 ) 17,569 Indefinite-lived research and development 4,920 — 4,920 9,990 — 9,990 Total intangible assets, net $ 28,657 $ (7,424 ) $ 21,233 $ 33,950 $ (6,391 ) $ 27,559 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent acquired IPR&D associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval. Indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 related to the acquisitions of Stemcentrx and BI compounds. See Note 5 for additional information. The latest annual impairment assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets was completed in the third quarter of 2018 which supported that no impairment existed at that time. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company made a decision to stop enrollment for the TAHOE trial, a Phase 3 study evaluating Rova-T as a second-line therapy for advanced small cell lung cancer following a recommendation from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee. This decision lowered the probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval across Rova-T and other early-stage assets and represented a triggering event which required the company to evaluate for impairment the IPR&D assets associated with the Stemcentrx acquisition. The company utilized multi-period excess earnings models of the “income approach” and determined that the current fair value was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 , which was lower than the carrying value of $6.1 billion and resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $5.1 billion ( $4.5 billion after 60 | 2018 Form 10-K tax). The fair value measurements were based on Level 3 inputs. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of the models included the estimated annual cash flows for each asset (including net revenues, cost of sales, R&D costs, selling and marketing costs and working capital/contributory asset charges), the appropriate discount rate to select in order to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset’s life cycle, the regulatory approval probabilities, commercial success risks, competitive landscape as well as other factors. This impairment charge was recorded to R&D expense in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018 . AbbVie continues to evaluate information as it becomes available with respect to the Stemcentrx-related clinical development programs and will monitor the remaining IPR&D assets for further impairment. No indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in 2017 and 2016 . Future impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets will be performed annually in the third quarter, or earlier if impairment indicators exist. Definite-Lived Intangible Assets Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 2 to 16 years with an average of 11 years for both developed product rights and license agreements. Amortization expense was $1.3 billion in 2018 , $1.1 billion in 2017 and $764 million in 2016 and was included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The anticipated annual amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2018 is as follows: (in billions) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Anticipated annual amortization expense $ 1.5 $ 1.7 $ 1.9 $ 2.1 $ 2.2 No definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in 2018 . In 2017 , an impairment charge of $354 million was recorded related to ZINBRYTA that reduced both the gross carrying amount and net carrying amount of the underlying intangible assets due to lower expected future cash flows for the product. In 2016 , an impairment charge of $39 million was recorded related to certain developed product rights in the United States due to a decline in the market for the product. The 2017 and 2016 impairment charges were based on discounted cash flow analyses and were included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. Note 8 Restructuring Plans AbbVie continuously evaluates its operations to identify opportunities to optimize its manufacturing and R&D operations, commercial infrastructure and administrative costs and to respond to changes in its business environment. As a result, AbbVie management periodically approves individual restructuring plans to achieve these objectives. In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , no such plans were individually significant. Restructuring charges recorded were $70 million in 2018 , $86 million in 2017 and $52 million in 2016 and were primarily related to employee severance and contractual obligations. These charges were recorded in cost of products sold, R&D expense and SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the classification of the affected employees or operations. The following table summarizes the cash activity in the restructuring reserve for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : (in millions) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2015 $ 148 2016 restructuring charges 52 Payments and other adjustments (113 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2016 87 2017 restructuring charges 86 Payments and other adjustments (87 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2017 86 2018 restructuring charges 59 Payments and other adjustments (46 ) Accrued balance as of December 31, 2018 $ 99 2018 Form 10-K | 61 Note 9 Debt, Credit Facilities and Commitments and Contingencies The following table summarizes long-term debt: as of December 31 (dollars in millions) Effective interest rate in 2018 (a) 2018 Effective interest rate in 2017 (a) 2017 Senior notes issued in 2012 2.00% notes due 2018 2.15 % $ — 2.15 % $ 1,000 2.90% notes due 2022 2.97 % 3,100 2.97 % 3,100 4.40% notes due 2042 4.46 % 2,600 4.46 % 2,600 Senior notes issued in 2015 1.80% notes due 2018 1.92 % — 1.92 % 3,000 2.50% notes due 2020 2.65 % 3,750 2.65 % 3,750 3.20% notes due 2022 3.28 % 1,000 3.28 % 1,000 3.60% notes due 2025 3.66 % 3,750 3.66 % 3,750 4.50% notes due 2035 4.58 % 2,500 4.58 % 2,500 4.70% notes due 2045 4.73 % 2,700 4.73 % 2,700 Senior notes issued in 2016 2.30% notes due 2021 2.40 % 1,800 2.40 % 1,800 2.85% notes due 2023 2.91 % 1,000 2.91 % 1,000 3.20% notes due 2026 3.28 % 2,000 3.28 % 2,000 4.30% notes due 2036 4.37 % 1,000 4.37 % 1,000 4.45% notes due 2046 4.50 % 2,000 4.50 % 2,000 Senior Euro notes issued in 2016 0.38% notes due 2019 (€1,400 principal) 0.55 % 1,604 0.55 % 1,673 1.38% notes due 2024 (€1,450 principal) 1.46 % 1,661 1.46 % 1,733 2.13% notes due 2028 (€750 principal) 2.18 % 859 2.18 % 896 Senior notes issued in 2018 3.375% notes due 2021 3.51 % 1,250 — % — 3.75% notes due 2023 3.84 % 1,250 — % — 4.25% notes due 2028 4.38 % 1,750 — % — 4.875% notes due 2048 4.94 % 1,750 — % — Term loan facilities Floating rate notes due 2018 3.06 % — 2.26 % 2,000 Other 36 110 Fair value hedges (466 ) (401 ) Unamortized bond discounts (120 ) (97 ) Unamortized deferred financing costs (163 ) (146 ) Total long-term debt and lease obligations 36,611 36,968 Current portion 1,609 6,015 Noncurrent portion $ 35,002 $ 30,953 (a) Excludes the effect of any related interest rate swaps. In September 2018, the company issued $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes due 2021, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior notes due 2023, $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due 2028 and $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2048. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and 62 | 2018 Form 10-K unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium, and except for the 3.375% notes due 2021, AbbVie may redeem the senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $37 million and debt discounts totaled $37 million and are being amortized over the respective terms of the senior notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Of the $5.9 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the company's outstanding three -year term loan credit agreement in September 2018 and $1.0 billion was used to repay the aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior notes at maturity in November 2018. The company intends to use the remaining proceeds to repay term loan obligations in 2019 as they become due. In May 2018, the company also repaid $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.80% senior notes at maturity. In November 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes at par between one and three months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $17 million and debt discounts totaled $9 million and are being amortized over the respective terms of the senior notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The company used the proceeds to redeem $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% senior notes that were due to mature in November 2017. As a result of this redemption, the company incurred a charge of $39 million ( $25 million after tax) related to the make-whole premium, write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and other expenses. The charge was recorded in interest expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. In May 2016, the company issued $7.8 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. These senior notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. In connection with the offering, debt issuance costs incurred totaled $52 million and debt discounts totaled $29 million and are being amortized over the respective terms of the senior notes to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Of the $7.7 billion net proceeds, $2.0 billion was used to repay the company’s outstanding term loan that was due to mature in November 2016, approximately $1.9 billion was used to finance the acquisition of Stemcentrx and approximately $3.8 billion was used to finance an ASR with a third party financial institution. See Note 5 for additional information related to the acquisition of Stemcentrx and Note 12 for additional information related to the ASR. In connection with the May 2016 unsecured senior notes issuance, AbbVie repaid a $2.0 billion 364 -day term loan credit agreement. AbbVie has outstanding $13.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which were issued in 2015. AbbVie may redeem the senior notes, at any time, prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium and AbbVie may redeem the senior notes at par between one and six months prior to maturity. AbbVie has outstanding $5.7 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes which were issued in 2012. AbbVie may redeem all of the senior notes of each series, at any time, or some of the senior notes of each series, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus a make-whole premium. At December 31, 2018 , the company was in compliance with its senior note covenants and term loan covenants. Short-Term Borrowings Short-term borrowings included commercial paper borrowings of $699 million at December 31, 2018 and $400 million at December 31, 2017 . The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings was 2.0% in 2018 , 1.3% in 2017 and 0.6% in 2016 . In August 2018, AbbVie replaced its existing revolving credit facility with a new $3.0 billion five -year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2023. The new facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December 31, 2018 , the company was in compliance with all its credit facility covenants. Commitment fees under AbbVie's revolving credit facilities were insignificant in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 . In May 2018 , AbbVie entered into a $3.0 billion 364 -day term loan credit agreement (term loan). In June 2018, the company drew on this term loan and as of December 31, 2018 , $3.0 billion was outstanding and was included in short-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet. Borrowings under the term loan bear interest at one month LIBOR plus 2018 Form 10-K | 63 applicable margin. The term loan may be prepaid without penalty upon prior notice and contains customary covenants, all of which the company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2018 . Maturities of Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations The following table summarizes AbbVie's future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases, debt maturities and future minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations as of December 31, 2018 : as of and for the years ending December 31 (in millions) Operating leases Debt maturities and capital leases 2019 $ 116 $ 1,612 2020 105 3,755 2021 100 3,053 2022 81 4,120 2023 64 2,250 Thereafter 343 22,570 Total obligations and commitments 809 37,360 Fair value hedges, unamortized bond discounts and deferred financing costs (749 ) Total long-term debt and lease obligations $ 809 $ 36,611 Lease expense was $161 million in 2018 , $169 million in 2017 and $159 million in 2016 . AbbVie's operating leases generally include renewal options and provide for the company to pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating costs of the leased property. As of December 31, 2018 , annual future minimum lease payments for capital lease obligations were insignificant. Contingencies and Guarantees In connection with the separation, AbbVie has indemnified Abbott for all liabilities resulting from the operation of AbbVie's business other than income tax liabilities with respect to periods prior to the distribution date and other liabilities as agreed to by AbbVie and Abbott. AbbVie has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements and no special-purpose entities. In the ordinary course of business, AbbVie has periodically entered into third-party agreements, such as the assignment of product rights, which have resulted in AbbVie becoming secondarily liable for obligations for which AbbVie had previously been primarily liable. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. Note 10 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Risk Management Policy The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. AbbVie's hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company's judgment of the appropriate trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The company uses derivative and nonderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. AbbVie also periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional amount. Derivative instruments are not used for trading purposes or to manage exposure to changes in interest rates for investment securities, and none of the company's outstanding derivative instruments contain credit risk related contingent features; collateral is generally not required. Financial Instruments Various AbbVie foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the local entity. These contracts, with notional amounts totaling $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2017 , are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value. The durations of these forward exchange contracts were generally less than eighteen months . Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2018 will be reclassified from AOCI and included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally not exceeding six months from the date of settlement. 64 | 2018 Form 10-K The company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated trade payables and receivables and intercompany loans. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value. Resulting gains or losses are reflected in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. These contracts had notional amounts totaling $8.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and $7.7 billion at December 31, 2017 . The company also uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company issued €3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior Euro notes and designated the principal amounts of this foreign denominated debt as net investment hedges. Concurrently, the company settled foreign currency forward exchange contracts with aggregate notional amounts of €3.5 billion that were designated as net investment hedges. AbbVie is a party to interest rate hedge contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts totaling $10.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and $11.8 billion at December 31, 2017 . The effect of the hedge contracts is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a floating rate for that portion of the debt. AbbVie records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. No amounts are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow hedges, net investment hedges or fair value hedges. The following table summarizes the amounts and location of AbbVie's derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets: Fair value - Derivatives in asset position Fair value - Derivatives in liability position as of December 31 (in millions) Balance sheet caption 2018 2017 Balance sheet caption 2018 2017 Foreign currency forward exchange contracts Designated as cash flow hedges Prepaid expenses and other $ 113 $ 1 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ — $ 120 Not designated as hedges Prepaid expenses and other 19 22 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 26 29 Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges Prepaid expenses and other — — Accounts payable and accrued liabilities — 8 Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges Other assets — — Other long-term liabilities 466 393 Total derivatives $ 132 $ 23 $ 492 $ 550 While certain derivatives are subject to netting arrangements with the company's counterparties, the company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets.

The fair values of available-for-sale debt securities were determined based on prices obtained from commercial pricing services. The derivatives entered into by the company were valued using published spot curves for interest rate hedges and published forward curves for foreign currency contracts. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration liabilities were determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products still in development. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these inputs. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period. At December 31, 2018 , a 50 basis point increase/decrease in the assumed discount rate would have decreased/increased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $160 million . Additionally, at December 31, 2018 , a five percentage point increase/decrease in the assumed probability of success across all potential indications would have increased/decreased the value of the contingent consideration liabilities by approximately $420 million . There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between the fair value measurement levels. The following table presents the changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities which are measured using Level 3 inputs: years ended December 31 (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Beginning balance $ 4,534 $ 4,213 $ — Additions (See Note 5) — — 3,985 Change in fair value recognized in net earnings 49 626 228 Milestone payments (100 ) (305 ) — Ending balance $ 4,483 $ 4,534 $ 4,213 The change in fair value recognized in net earnings is recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recorded a $428 million decrease in the Stemcentrx contingent consideration liability due to a reduction in probabilities of success of achieving regulatory approval. 2018 Form 10-K | 67 Certain financial instruments are carried at historical cost or some basis other than fair value.

The company records these investments at cost and remeasures them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $84 million as of December 31, 2018 . No significant cumulative upward or downward adjustments have been recorded for these investments as of December 31, 2018 . Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 discussed in Note 2 , these investments were accounted for under the cost method and disclosed in the table below as of December 31, 2017 .

Net realized gains and losses were insignificant in 2018 and 2016 . Net realized gains in 2017 were $90 million . Concentrations of Risk The company invests excess cash in time deposits, money market funds and debt securities to diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions. The company has established credit exposure limits and monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with financial institution deposits. The functional currency of the company's Venezuela operations is the U.S. dollar due to the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy. During the first quarter of 2016, in consideration of declining economic conditions in Venezuela and a decline in transactions settled at the official rate, AbbVie determined that its net monetary assets denominated in the Venezuelan bolivar (VEF) were no longer expected to be settled at the official rate of 10 VEF per U.S. dollar, but rather at the Divisa Complementaria (DICOM) rate. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2016, AbbVie recorded a charge of $298 million to net foreign exchange loss to revalue its bolivar-denominated net monetary assets using the DICOM rate then in effect of approximately 270 VEF per U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , AbbVie’s net monetary assets in Venezuela were insignificant. Of total net accounts receivable, three U.S. wholesalers accounted for 63% as of December 31, 2018 and 56% as of December 31, 2017 , and substantially all of AbbVie's net revenues in the United States were to these three wholesalers. HUMIRA (adalimumab) is AbbVie's single largest product and accounted for approximately 61% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2018 , 65% in 2017 and 63% in 2016 . Note 11 Post-Employment Benefits AbbVie sponsors various pension and other post-employment benefit plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. In addition, AbbVie provides medical benefits, primarily to eligible retirees in the United States and Puerto Rico, through other post-retirement benefit plans. Net obligations for these plans have been reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 . 2018 Form 10-K | 69 The following table summarizes benefit plan information for the global AbbVie-sponsored defined benefit and other post-employment plans: Defined benefit plans Other post-employment plans as of and for the years ended December 31 (in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Projected benefit obligations Beginning of period $ 6,985 $ 5,829 $ 813 $ 627 Service cost 285 236 26 26 Interest cost 227 204 25 24 Employee contributions 2 2 — — Actuarial (gain) loss (614 ) 714 (287 ) 149 Benefits paid (191 ) (173 ) (16 ) (15 ) Other, primarily foreign currency translation adjustments (76 ) 173 — 2 End of period 6,618 6,985 561 813 Fair value of plan assets Beginning of period 5,399 4,572 — — Actual return on plan assets (384 ) 684 — — Company contributions 873 246 16 15 Employee contributions 2 2 — — Benefits paid (191 ) (173 ) (16 ) (15 ) Other, primarily foreign currency translation adjustments (62 ) 68 — — End of period 5,637 5,399 — — Funded status, end of period $ (981 ) $ (1,586 ) $ (561 ) $ (813 ) Amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheets Other assets $ 321 $ 388 $ — $ — Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (8 ) (32 ) (15 ) (15 ) Other long-term liabilities (1,294 ) (1,942 ) (546 ) (798 ) Net obligation $ (981 ) $ (1,586 ) $ (561 ) $ (813 ) Actuarial loss, net $ 2,516 $ 2,471 $ 25 $ 320 Prior service cost (credit) 11 12 (22 ) (29 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ 2,527 $ 2,483 $ 3 $ 291 The projected benefit obligations (PBO) in the table above included $1.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017 , related to international defined benefit plans.

The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% in 2050 and remain at that level thereafter. For purposes of measuring the 2018 post-retirement health care costs, the company assumed a 7.7% pre-65 ( 9.5% post-65) annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% for 2050 and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. As of December 31, 2018 , a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects: One percentage point year ended December 31, 2018 (in millions) (brackets denote a reduction) Increase Decrease Service cost and interest cost $ 13 $ (10 ) Projected benefit obligation 110 (87 ) Defined Benefit Pension Plan Assets Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions) 2018 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities U.S. large cap (a) $ 719 $ 719 $ — $ — U.S. mid cap (b) 67 67 — — International (c) 226 226 — — Fixed income securities U.S. government securities (d) 140 21 119 — Corporate debt instruments (d) 385 123 262 — Non-U.S. government securities (d) 175 48 127 — Other (d) 232 225 7 — Absolute return funds (e) 261 3 258 — Real assets 7 7 — — Other (f) 147 147 — — Total $ 2,359 $ 1,586 $ 773 $ — Total assets measured at NAV 3,278 Fair value of plan assets $ 5,637 72 | 2018 Form 10-K Basis of fair value measurement as of December 31 (in millions) 2017 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Equities U.S. large cap (a) $ 597 $ 597 $ — $ — U.S. mid cap (b) 74 74 — — International (c) 63 63 — — Fixed income securities U.S. government securities (d) 110 6 104 — Corporate debt instruments (d) 238 132 106 — Non-U.S. government securities (d) 59 25 34 — Other (d) 265 260 5 — Absolute return funds (e) 262 4 258 — Real assets 7 7 — — Other (f) 40 40 — — Total $ 1,715 $ 1,208 $ 507 $ — Total assets measured at NAV 3,684 Fair value of plan assets $ 5,399 (a) A mix of index funds and actively managed equity accounts that are benchmarked to various large cap indices.

(f) Investments in cash and cash equivalents. Equities and registered investment companies having quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are quoted at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors. Investments held in pooled investment funds, common collective trusts or limited partnerships are valued at the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is provided by the fund administrator and is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities and lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are established for each plan and are generally made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The target investment allocations for the AbbVie Pension Plan is 35% in equity securities, 20% in fixed income securities and 45% in asset allocation strategies and other holdings. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plan assets of the AbbVie Pension Plan or of any other plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption for each plan is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolio. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. 2018 Form 10-K | 73 Expected Benefit Payments The following table summarizes total benefit payments expected to be paid to plan participants including payments funded from both plan and company assets: years ending December 31 (in millions) Defined benefit plans Other post-employment plans 2019 $ 209 $ 16 2020 221 19 2021 235 21 2022 249 21 2023 265 22 2024 to 2028 1,589 135 Defined Contribution Plan AbbVie's principal defined contribution plan is the AbbVie Savings Plan. AbbVie recorded expense of $89 million in 2018 , $82 million in 2017 and $75 million in 2016 related to this plan. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees. Note 12 Equity Stock-Based Compensation AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP), which provides for several different forms of benefits, including nonqualified stock options, RSAs, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the 2013 ISP, 100 million shares of AbbVie common stock were reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees. The 2013 ISP also facilitated the assumption of certain awards granted under Abbott’s incentive stock program, which were adjusted and converted into Abbott and AbbVie stock-based awards as a result of AbbVie's separation from Abbott. AbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least ten years of service. Stock-based compensation expense is principally related to awards issued pursuant to the 2013 ISP and is summarized as follows: Years ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Cost of products sold $ 27 $ 23 $ 22 Research and development 169 159 193 Selling, general and administrative 225 183 181 Pre-tax compensation expense 421 365 396 Tax benefit 73 73 104 After-tax compensation expense $ 348 $ 292 $ 292 Realized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation totaled $78 million in 2018 , $71 million in 2017 and $55 million in 2016 . Since 2017, all excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards have been recognized in the statement of earnings when the awards vest or settle, rather than in stockholders' equity as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement. 74 | 2018 Form 10-K Stock Options Stock options awarded to employees typically have a contractual term of 10 years and generally vest in one-third increments over a three -year period. The exercise price is equal to at least 100% of the market value on the date of grant. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options granted were $21.63 in 2018 , $9.80 in 2017 and $9.29 in 2016 . The following table summarizes AbbVie stock option activity in 2018 : (options in thousands, aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Options Weighted- average exercise price Weighted- average remaining life (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value Outstanding at December 31, 2017 8,316 $ 41.69 5.1 $ 458 Granted 634 114.36 Exercised (2,781 ) 28.75 Lapsed (26 ) 17.03 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 6,143 $ 55.05 6.2 $ 242 Exercisable at December 31, 2018 4,293 $ 45.23 5.3 $ 202 The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $215 million in 2018 , $371 million in 2017 and $325 million in 2016 . The total fair value of options vested during 2018 was $22 million . As of December 31, 2018 , $6 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . RSAs, RSUs and Performance Shares RSUs awarded to employees other than senior executives and other key employees generally vest in one-third increments over a three year period. Recipients of these RSUs are entitled to receive dividend equivalents as dividends are declared and paid during the RSU vesting period. The majority of the equity awards AbbVie grants to its senior executives and other key employees are performance-based. Such awards granted before 2016 consisted of RSAs or RSUs for which vesting was contingent upon AbbVie achieving a minimum annual return on equity (ROE). Since 2016, equity awards granted to senior executives and other key employees consist of a combination of performance-vested RSUs and performance shares as well as non-qualified stock options described above. The performance-vested RSUs have the potential to vest in one-third increments during a three -year performance period based on AbbVie’s ROE relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. The recipient may receive one share of AbbVie common stock for each vested award. The performance shares have the potential to vest over a three -year performance period and may be earned based on AbbVie’s EPS achievement and AbbVie’s total stockholder return (TSR) (a market condition) relative to a defined peer group of pharmaceutical, biotech and life sciences companies. Dividend equivalents on performance-vested RSUs and performance shares accrue during the performance period and are payable at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSAs, RSUs and performance shares generally is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the quoted price of AbbVie’s common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance shares with a TSR market condition are determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table summarizes AbbVie RSA, RSU and performance share activity for 2018 : (share units in thousands) Share units Weighted-average grant date fair value Outstanding at December 31, 2017 10,682 $ 59.47 Granted 4,771 103.31 Vested (5,073 ) 59.41 Forfeited (512 ) 73.45 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 9,868 $ 79.90 The fair market value of RSAs, RSUs and performance shares (as applicable) vested was $583 million in 2018 , $348 million in 2017 and $362 million in 2016 . 2018 Form 10-K | 75 As of December 31, 2018 , $307 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSAs, RSUs and performance shares is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately the next two years . Cash Dividends Cash dividends declared per common share totaled $3.95 in 2018, $2.63 in 2017 and $2.35 in 2016. The following table summarizes quarterly cash dividends declared during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : 2018 2017 2016 Date Declared Payment Date Dividend Per Share Date Declared Payment Date Dividend Per Share Date Declared Payment Date Dividend Per Share 11/02/18 02/15/19 $1.07 10/27/17 02/15/18 $0.71 10/28/16 02/15/17 $0.64 09/07/18 11/15/18 $0.96 09/08/17 11/15/17 $0.64 09/09/16 11/15/16 $0.57 06/14/18 08/15/18 $0.96 06/22/17 08/15/17 $0.64 06/16/16 08/15/16 $0.57 02/15/18 05/15/18 $0.96 02/16/17 05/15/17 $0.64 02/18/16 05/16/16 $0.57 Stock Repurchase Program The company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management’s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Shares repurchased under these programs are recorded at acquisition cost, including related expenses and are available for general corporate purposes. On February 15, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase program, which superseded AbbVie's previous stock repurchase program. On December 13, 2018, AbbVie's board of directors authorized a $5.0 billion increase to the existing $10.0 billion stock repurchase program. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased approximately 109 million shares for $10.7 billion in 2018. AbbVie's remaining share repurchase authorization was $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 . Under previous stock repurchase programs, AbbVie made open-market share repurchases of approximately 11 million shares for $1.3 billion in 2018 , approximately 13 million shares for $1.0 billion in 2017 and approximately 34 million shares for $2.1 billion in 2016 . Additionally, in 2016 , AbbVie executed an ASR in connection with the Stemcentrx acquisition and repurchased approximately 60 million shares for $3.8 billion . 76 | 2018 Form 10-K Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table summarizes the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : (in millions) (brackets denote losses) Foreign currency translation adjustments Net investment hedging activities Pension and post- employment benefits Marketable security activities Cash flow hedging activities Total Balance as of December 31, 2015 $ (1,270 ) $ — $ (1,378 ) $ 47 $ 40 $ (2,561 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (165 ) 140 (194 ) 7 160 (52 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — — 59 (8 ) (24 ) 27 Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) (165 ) 140 (135 ) (1 ) 136 (25 ) Balance as of December 31, 2016 (1,435 ) 140 (1,513 ) 46 176 (2,586 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 680 (343 ) (480 ) 29 (230 ) (344 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss 316 — 74 (75 ) (112 ) 203 Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) 996 (343 ) (406 ) (46 ) (342 ) (141 ) Balance as of December 31, 2017 (439 ) (203 ) (1,919 ) — (166 ) (2,727 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (391 ) 138 84 (14 ) 156 (27 ) Net losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss — — 113 4 157 274 Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) (391 ) 138 197 (10 ) 313 247 Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ (830 ) $ (65 ) $ (1,722 ) $ (10 ) $ 147 $ (2,480 ) Other comprehensive loss in 2018 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a loss of $391 million , which was principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets. In 2017, AbbVie reclassified $316 million of historical currency translation losses from AOCI related to the liquidation of certain foreign entities following the enactment of U.S. tax reform. These losses were included in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statement of earnings and had no related income tax impacts. Other comprehensive loss in 2017 also included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a gain of $680 million , which was principally due to the impact of the strengthening of the Euro on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets. Other comprehensive loss in 2016 included foreign currency translation adjustments totaling a loss of $165 million , which was principally due to the impact of the weakening of the Euro on the translation of the company’s Euro-denominated assets. 2018 Form 10-K | 77 The table below presents the impact on AbbVie's consolidated statements of earnings for significant amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss: years ended December 31 (in millions) (brackets denote gains) 2018 2017 2016 Pension and post-employment benefits Amortization of actuarial losses and other (a) $ 141 $ 107 $ 85 Tax benefit (28 ) (33 ) (26 ) Total reclassifications, net of tax $ 113 $ 74 $ 59 Cash flow hedging activities Losses (gains) on designated cash flow hedges (b) $ 161 $ (118 ) $ (20 ) Tax expense (benefit) (4 ) 6 (4 ) Total reclassifications, net of tax $ 157 $ (112 ) $ (24 ) (a) Amounts are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost (see Note 11 ).

The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on a mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously untaxed. These changes were generally effective for tax years beginning in 2018. 78 | 2018 Form 10-K The Act also created a minimum tax on certain foreign sourced earnings. The taxability of the foreign earnings and the applicable tax rates are dependent on future events. The company’s accounting policy for the minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings is to report the tax effects on the basis that the minimum tax will be recognized in tax expense in the year it is incurred as a period expense. Additionally, the Act significantly changed the timing and manner in which earnings of foreign subsidiaries are subject to U.S. tax. Therefore, unremitted foreign earnings previously considered indefinitely reinvested that were subject to the Act’s transition tax are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. Post-2017 earnings subject to the U.S. minimum tax on foreign sourced earnings and the 100 percent foreign dividends received deduction are also not considered indefinitely reinvested earnings. As such, the company records foreign withholding tax liabilities related to the future cash repatriation of such earnings. However, the company considers instances of outside basis differences in foreign subsidiaries that would incur additional U.S. tax upon reversal (e.g., capital gain distribution) to be permanent in duration. The unrecognized tax liability is not practicable to determine. Prior to the enactment of the Act, the company did not provide deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. Due to the provision of the Act that required a one-time deemed repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, in 2017, the company recorded a transition tax expense of $4.5 billion . The company also recognized income tax expense of $338 million related to transition tax on income from the sale of inventory in 2018. The transition tax is generally payable in eight annual installments. Additionally, in 2017, the company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on tax rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future. In 2017, the net tax benefit of U.S. tax reform from the remeasurement of deferred taxes related to the Act and foreign tax law changes was $3.6 billion . Given the complexity of the Act and anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury about implementing the Act, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not extending beyond one year from the enactment date of the Act. As a result, in 2017, the company’s analysis and accounting for the tax effects of the Act was preliminary. In 2017, as a direct result of the Act, the company recorded $4.5 billion of transition tax expense, as well as $4.1 billion of net tax benefit for deferred tax remeasurement. Both of these amounts were provisional estimates, as the company had not fully completed its analysis and calculation of foreign earnings subject to the transition tax or its analysis of certain other aspects of the Act that impacted the remeasurement of deferred tax balances. In 2018, the company finalized its provisional estimates and recognized income tax expense related to the Act of $86 million , which primarily related to the transition tax expense on the one-time mandatory repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation years ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Statutory tax rate 21.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Effect of foreign operations (28.7 ) (12.2 ) (10.3 ) U.S. tax credits (7.3 ) (4.0 ) (4.4 ) Impacts related to U.S. tax reform 8.2 12.0 — Tax law change related to foreign currency — — 2.4 Stock-based compensation excess tax benefit (1.5 ) (0.9 ) — Tax audit settlements (2.5 ) (1.2 ) — All other, net 1.4 2.6 1.8 Effective tax rate (9.4 )% 31.3 % 24.5 % The effective income tax rate fluctuates year to year due to the allocation of the company's taxable earnings among jurisdictions, as well as certain discrete factors and events in each year, including changes in tax law, acquisitions and collaborations. The effective income tax rates in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to changes in enacted tax rates and laws, the benefit from foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, the cost of repatriation decisions and Stemcentrx impairment related expenses. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes. 2018 Form 10-K | 79 The effective income tax rate in 2018 and 2017 included impacts related to U.S. tax reform. Specific to 2018, there was a favorable impact of the effective date of provisions of the Act related to the earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. The 2018 effective income tax rate also reflects the effects of Stemcentrx impairment related expenses. In addition, the company recognized a net tax benefit of $131 million in 2018 and $91 million in 2017 related to the resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years. The effective income tax rate in 2016 included additional expense of $187 million related to the recognition of the tax effect of regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on December 7, 2016 that changed the determination of the U.S. taxability of foreign currency gains and losses related to certain foreign operations.

The state tax carryforwards expire between 2019 and 2038. As of December 31, 2018 , foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $427 million . Foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $350 million expire between 2020 and 2028 and the remaining do not have an expiration period. The company had valuation allowances of $103 million as of December 31, 2018 and $108 million as of December 31, 2017 . These were principally related to state net operating losses and credit carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. Current income taxes receivable were $488 million as of December 31, 2018 and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and were included in prepaid expenses and other on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrecognized Tax Benefits years ended December 31 (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Beginning balance $ 2,701 $ 1,168 $ 954 Increase due to current year tax positions 163 1,768 118 Increase due to prior year tax positions 110 16 111 Decrease due to prior year tax positions (36 ) (2 ) (7 ) Settlements (79 ) (233 ) — Lapse of statutes of limitations (7 ) (16 ) (8 ) Ending balance $ 2,852 $ 2,701 $ 1,168 80 | 2018 Form 10-K AbbVie and Abbott entered into a tax sharing agreement, effective on the date of separation, which provides that Abbott is liable for and has indemnified AbbVie against all income tax liabilities for periods prior to the separation. AbbVie will be responsible for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties for periods after separation or in instances where an existing entity was transferred to AbbVie upon separation. If recognized, the net amount of potential tax benefits that would impact the company's effective tax rate is $2.7 billion in 2018 and $2.6 billion in 2017 . Of the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in the table above as of December 31, 2018 , AbbVie would be indemnified for approximately $84 million . The “Increase due to current year tax positions” in the table above includes amounts related to federal, state and international tax items. The ""Increase due to prior year tax positions"" in the table above includes amounts relating to federal, state and international items as well as prior positions acquired through business development activities during the year. AbbVie recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. AbbVie recognized gross income tax expense of $73 million in 2018 , $24 million in 2017 and $35 million in 2016 , for interest and penalties related to income tax matters. AbbVie had an accrual for the payment of gross interest and penalties of $190 million at December 31, 2018 , $120 million at December 31, 2017 and $112 million at December 31, 2016 . The company is routinely audited by the tax authorities in significant jurisdictions and a number of audits are currently underway. It is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, the company's gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months up to $486 million . All significant federal, state, local and international matters have been concluded for years through 2010. The company believes adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. Note 14 Legal Proceedings and Contingencies AbbVie is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. The recorded accrual balance for litigation was approximately $350 million as of December 31, 2018 and approximately $445 million as of December 31, 2017 . Initiation of new legal proceedings or a change in the status of existing proceedings may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by AbbVie. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the separation agreement by and between Abbott and AbbVie, AbbVie assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its business, including liabilities for any claims or legal proceedings related to products that had been part of its business, but were discontinued prior to the distribution, as well as assumed or retained liabilities, and will indemnify Abbott for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Several pending lawsuits filed against Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company Abbott acquired in February 2010 and now known as AbbVie Products LLC) and others are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under the Multi-District Litigation (MDL) Rules as In re: AndroGel Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2084. These cases, brought by private plaintiffs and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), generally allege Solvay's patent litigation involving AndroGel was sham litigation and the 2006 patent litigation settlement agreements and related agreements with three generic companies violate federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. These cases include: (a) four individual plaintiff lawsuits; (b) three purported class actions; and (c) Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. et al. Following the district court's dismissal of all plaintiffs' claims, appellate proceedings led to the reinstatement of the claims regarding the patent litigation settlements, which are proceeding in the district court. In July 2018, the court denied the private plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Lawsuits are pending against AbbVie and others generally alleging that the 2005 patent litigation settlement involving Niaspan entered into between Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a company acquired by Abbott in 2006 and presently a subsidiary of AbbVie) and a generic company violates federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair and deceptive trade practices and unjust enrichment laws. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages and/or injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. The lawsuits 2018 Form 10-K | 81 consist of four individual plaintiff lawsuits and two consolidated purported class actions: one brought by three named direct purchasers of Niaspan and the other brought by ten named end-payer purchasers of Niaspan. The cases are consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the MDL Rules as In re: Niaspan Antitrust Litigation , MDL No. 2460. In October 2016, the Orange County, California District Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit on behalf of the State of California regarding the Niaspan patent litigation settlement in Orange County Superior Court, asserting a claim under the unfair competition provision of the California Business and Professions Code seeking injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. In May 2018, the California Court of Appeals ruled that the District Attorney’s Office may not bring monetary claims beyond the scope of Orange County. In September 2014, the FTC filed a lawsuit against AbbVie and others in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that the 2011 patent litigation with two generic companies regarding AndroGel was sham litigation and the settlements of that litigation violated federal antitrust law. In May 2015, the court dismissed the FTC’s settlement-related claim. In June 2018, following a bench trial, the court found for the FTC on its sham litigation claim and ordered a disgorgement remedy of $448 million , plus prejudgment interest. The court denied the FTC’s request for injunctive relief. AbbVie is appealing the court’s liability and disgorgement rulings and, based on an assessment of the merits of that appeal, no liability has been accrued for this matter. The FTC is also appealing aspects of the court’s trial ruling and the dismissal of its settlement-related claim. In July and August 2018, several direct AndroGel purchasers brought two individual and one class action cases in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging sham litigation based on the court’s trial ruling in the FTC’s case. Those cases are stayed pending the appeals in the FTC’s case. In March 2015, the State of Louisiana filed a lawsuit, State of Louisiana v. Fournier Industrie et Sante, et al. , against AbbVie, Abbott and affiliated Abbott entities in Louisiana state court. Plaintiff alleges that patent applications and patent litigation filed and other alleged conduct from the early 2000's and before related to the drug TriCor violated Louisiana State antitrust and unfair trade practices laws. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and attorneys' fees. Plaintiff has filed a writ of certiorari with the Louisiana Supreme Court seeking to appeal the August 2018 dismissal of this lawsuit by the Louisiana Court of Appeal. In November 2014, a putative class action lawsuit, Medical Mutual of Ohio v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , was filed against several manufacturers of testosterone replacement therapies (TRTs), including AbbVie, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of all insurance companies, health benefit providers, and other third party payers who paid for TRTs, including AndroGel. The claims asserted include violations of the federal RICO Act and state consumer fraud and deceptive trade practices laws. The complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. In July 2018, the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for class certification. Product liability cases are pending in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie and other manufacturers of TRTs did not adequately warn about risks of certain injuries, primarily heart attacks, strokes and blood clots. Approximately 4,000 claims are consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the MDL Rules as In re: Testosterone Replacement Therapy Products Liability Litigation , MDL No. 2545. Approximately 200 claims against AbbVie are pending in various state courts. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. Six cases have gone to trial. Four of those have resulted in complete verdicts for AbbVie: three by juries in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in January, May, and June 2018, and one by a jury in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court in August 2017. Another case in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois resulted in a March 2018 jury verdict for AbbVie on strict liability and fraud and for the plaintiff on negligence and awarded $200,000 in compensatory damages and $3 million in punitive damages, which is the subject of post-trial proceedings. Another case in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois resulted in a jury verdict for AbbVie on strict liability and for the plaintiff on remaining claims and an award of $140,000 in compensatory damages and $140 million in punitive damages in August 2017. In July 2018, the court vacated that verdict and ordered a new trial. In November 2018, AbbVie entered into a Master Settlement Agreement with the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee in the MDL encompassing all existing claims in all courts. All proceedings in pending cases are effectively stayed, including post-trial proceedings in cases that had been tried to verdict with appellate rights preserved. Product liability cases are pending in which plaintiffs generally allege that AbbVie did not adequately warn about risk of certain injuries, primarily various birth defects, arising from use of Depakote. Approximately 404 cases are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, and approximately six others are pending in various other federal and state courts. Plaintiffs generally seek compensatory and punitive damages. Over ninety percent of these pending cases, plus other unfiled claims, are subject to confidential settlement agreements and are expected to be dismissed with prejudice. To date, approximately 185 cases have been dismissed with prejudice. In November 2014, five individuals filed a putative class action lawsuit, Rubinstein, et al. v Gonzalez, et al. , on behalf of purchasers and sellers of certain Shire plc (Shire) securities between June 20 and October 14, 2014, against AbbVie and its chief executive officer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the defendants made 82 | 2018 Form 10-K and/or are responsible for material misstatements in violation of federal securities laws in connection with AbbVie's proposed transaction with Shire. In June 2016, a lawsuit, Elliott Associates, L.P., et al. v. AbbVie Inc. , was filed by five investment funds against AbbVie in the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court alleging that AbbVie made misrepresentations and omissions in connection with its proposed transaction with Shire. Similar lawsuits were filed between July 2017 and October 2018 against AbbVie and in some instances its chief executive officer in the same court by additional investment funds. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. In May 2017, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, Ellis v. Gonzalez, et al. , was filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that AbbVie's directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with statements made regarding the Shire transaction. The lawsuit sought unspecified compensatory damages for AbbVie, among other relief. In July 2018, the court dismissed this case with prejudice. In August 2018, plaintiff appealed that dismissal to the Delaware Supreme Court. In September 2018, the Commissioner of the California Department of Insurance intervened in a qui tam lawsuit, State of California and Lazaro Suarez v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , brought under the California Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, in California Superior Court for Alameda County. The Department of Insurance’s complaint alleges that, through patient and reimbursement support services and other services and items of value provided in connection with HUMIRA, AbbVie caused the submission of fraudulent commercial insurance claims for HUMIRA in violation of the California statute. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an assessment of up to three times the amount of the claims at issue, and civil penalties. In addition, two federal securities lawsuits were filed in September ( Pippins v. AbbVie Inc., et al. , in the United States District Court for the Central District of California) and October ( Holwill v. AbbVie Inc., et al ., in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) against AbbVie, its chief executive officer and then-chief financial officer, alleging that reasons stated for HUMIRA sales growth in financial filings between 2013 and 2017 were misleading because they omitted the conduct alleged in the Department of Insurance’s complaint. In November 2018, the Pippins case was voluntarily dismissed. Beginning in May 2016, the Patent Trial & Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (PTO) instituted five inter partes review proceedings brought by Coherus Biosciences and Boehringer Ingelheim related to three AbbVie patents covering methods of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis using adalimumab. In these proceedings, the PTO reviewed the validity of the patents and issued decisions of invalidity in May, June and July of 2017. AbbVie’s appeal of the decisions is pending in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, AbbVie filed a lawsuit, AbbVie Inc. v. Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. and Grifols Worldwide Operations Ltd. , in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Novartis Vaccines and Grifols Worldwide seeking a declaratory judgment that eleven HCV-related patents licensed to AbbVie in 2002 are invalid. AbbVie is seeking to enforce certain patent rights related to adalimumab (a drug AbbVie sells under the trademark HUMIRA®). In a case filed in United States District Court for the District of Delaware in August 2017, AbbVie alleges that Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH’s, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s, and Boehringer Ingelheim Fremont, Inc.’s proposed biosimilar adalimumab product infringes certain AbbVie patents. AbbVie seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Pharmacyclics LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AbbVie, is seeking to enforce its patent rights relating to ibrutinib capsules (a drug Pharmacyclics sells under the trademark IMBRUVICA®). In February 2018, four separate cases were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the following defendants: Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, Fresenius Kabi USA, Inc., and Fresenius Kabi Oncology Limited; Shilpa Medicare Limited, Sun Pharma Global FZE and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; Cipla Limited and Cipla USA Inc.; and Zydus Worldwide DMCC, Cadila Healthcare Limited, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Sandoz Inc., and Lek Pharmaceuticals D.D. In November 2018, Pharmacyclics filed a fifth suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Hetero USA Inc., Hetero Labs Limited and Hetero Labs Limited Unit-I and Unit-V. In each case, Pharmacyclics alleges the defendant’s proposed generic ibrutinib product infringes certain Pharmacyclics patents and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Janssen Biotech, Inc. which is in a global collaboration with Pharmacyclics concerning the development and marketing of IMBRUVICA, is the co-plaintiff in these suits. 2018 Form 10-K | 83 Note 15 Segment and Geographic Area Information AbbVie operates in one business segment—pharmaceutical products.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 27, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Adoption of ASU No. 2016-16 As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for the income tax consequences of intercompany transfers of assets other than inventory in 2018 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory . Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. Chicago, Illinois February 27, 2019 88 | 2018 Form 10-K ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Richard A. Gonzalez, and the Chief Financial Officer, Robert A. Michael, evaluated the effectiveness of AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that AbbVie's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information AbbVie is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AbbVie in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to AbbVie's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 . Inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls. AbbVie's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that AbbVie's disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Management of AbbVie is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, management concluded that AbbVie maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 . 2018 Form 10-K | 89 Report of independent registered public accounting firm. The report of AbbVie's independent registered public accounting firm related to its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is included below. 90 | 2018 Form 10-K Report Of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AbbVie Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of AbbVie Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 , and the related notes and our report dated February 27, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 27, 2019 2018 Form 10-K | 91 ITEM 9B.
