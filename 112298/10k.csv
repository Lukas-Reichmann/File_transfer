BUSINESS General Walmart Inc. (""Walmart,"" the ""Company"" or ""we"") is a people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to help people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve approximately 240 million customers who visit more than 10,500 stores and numerous eCommerce websites in 20 countries. Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (""EDLP""). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost (""EDLC"") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023""), January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022"") and January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021""). During fiscal 2023, we generated total revenues of $611.3 billion, which was comprised primarily of net sales of $605.9 billion. We maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""WMT."" The Development of Our Company The businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2023, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 19 countries. In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have over 8,100 pickup and approximately 7,000 delivery locations globally. In recent years, we have heavily invested in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, which has enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, incubate digitally-native brands, and expand our assortment and service offerings. We have also continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives, such as with our acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart""), which is our ecosystem in India that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra, as well as with our majority stake in PhonePe Private Limited (""PhonePe""), a digital transaction platform. We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, service offerings, eCommerce websites and marketplaces as well as our supply chain combined with approximately 2.1 million associates as of January 31, 2023 to better serve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates relationships where customers view Walmart as their primary destination. In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. As we execute on our strategy globally, our flywheel is accelerating through offerings such as our Walmart Connect advertising business, Walmart Fulfillment Services, providing access to quality, affordable healthcare via Walmart Health and Flipkart Health+, and our financial services businesses. These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our flywheel centered around our customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience. 6 Information About Our Segments We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. We also previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these divestitures. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club, which are further described below. Each segment contributes to the Company's operating results differently. However, each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to the exit of certain markets and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic information is contained in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Walmart U.S. Segment Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the ""Walmart"" and ""Walmart Neighborhood Market"" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $420.6 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 69% of our fiscal 2023 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $393.2 billion and $370.0 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate""). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. Omni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, through services such as pickup and delivery, in-home delivery, ship-from-store, and digital pharmacy fulfillment options. As of January 31, 2023, we had more tha n 4,600 pickup locations and more than 3,900 same-day delivery locations. Our Walmart+ membership offering provides enhanced omni-channel shopping benefits including unlimited free shipping on eligible items with no order minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel discounts, access to Paramount+ streaming service, and mobile scan & go for a streamlined in-store shopping experience. We have several eCommerce websites, the largest of which is walmart.com. We define eCommerce sales as sales initiated by customers digitally and fulfilled by a number of methods including our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and leveraging our stores, as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our flywheel strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. The following table provides the approximate size of our retail stores as of January 31, 2023: Minimum Square Feet Maximum Square Feet Average Square Feet Supercenters (general merchandise and grocery) 69,000 260,000 178,000 Discount stores (general merchandise and limited grocery) 30,000 206,000 105,000 Neighborhood markets (1) (grocery) 28,000 65,000 42,000 (1) Excludes other small formats. Merchandise. Walmart U.S. does business primarily in three strategic merchandise units, listed below: • Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat, produce, deli & bakery, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, pet supplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products; • General merchandise includes: ◦ Entertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music and books); ◦ Hardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery); ◦ Apparel (e.g., apparel for men, women, girls, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and ◦ Home (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed & bath, furniture and home organization, home furnishings, home decor, fabrics and crafts). • Health and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical services and other clinical services. Other categories in the Walmart U.S. business include an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, and newer initiatives such as B2B last mile delivery services via Walmart GoLocal, and a suite of data products for merchants and suppliers via Walmart Luminate. Additional service offerings include fuel, financial services and related products (including through our digital channels, stores and our fintech venture, ONE), such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment, and certain types of installment lending. 7 Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: ""Allswell,"" ""Athletic Works,"" ""Eloquii Elements,"" ""Equate,"" ""Free Assembly,"" ""Freshness Guaranteed,"" ""George,"" ""Great Value,"" ""Holiday Time,"" ""Hyper Tough,"" ""Mainstays,"" ""Marketside,"" ""No Boundaries,"" ""onn.,"" ""Ozark Trail,"" ""Parent's Choice,"" ""Sam's Choice,"" ""Scoop,"" ""Spring Valley,"" ""Time and Tru,"" ""Way to Celebrate"" and ""Wonder Nation."" The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: ""Avia,"" ""Love & Sports,"" ""Better Homes & Gardens,"" ""Pioneer Woman"" and ""Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara."" Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability. Operations. Walmart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets, as well as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, Walmart+, ship-from-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, social commerce platforms, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise and selection availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These strategies include the following: • EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity; • EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; • Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and • Expanding our flywheel and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services to provide our customers a broader set of offerings to meet expanding needs. Distribution. We continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 163 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2023, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 34 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more tha n 3,900 s tores. 8 Walmart International Segment Walmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 19 countries outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2023. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, China, and Africa (which includes Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zambia), and our majority-owned subsidiaries in India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Walmart International previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent divestitures. Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com, walmart.cn and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $101.0 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 17% of our fiscal 2023 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $101.0 billion and $121.4 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its format mix. Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years: • Divested of Walmart Argentina in November 2020. • Divested of Asda Group Limited (""Asda""), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021. • Divested of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021. • Bought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary in November 2022 and exited operations in certain countries in Africa in December 2022. • Increased our ownership in PhonePe, our digital transaction platform in India, as part of the separation from Flipkart in December 2022. Omni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets and our marketplaces such as Flipkart in India. Our financial services offerings continue to expand with our digital transaction platform anchored in payments at PhonePe in India. We have expanded our marketplace in Mexico and Canada, which unlocks fulfillment and advertising services, and in China, our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia continue to drive ecommerce growth. Generally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 24,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2023, Walmart International had over 2,900 pickup and approximately 2,500 delivery locations. Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as ""Equate,"" ""George,"" ""Great Value,"" ""Holiday Time,"" ""Mainstays,"" ""Marketside"" and ""Parent's Choice,"" our international markets have developed market specific brands including ""Aurrera,"" ""Lider,"" and ""PhonePe."" In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to build mutually reinforcing businesses in areas such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, healthcare and financial services. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India continues to grow, providing a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising. In Mexico, we also offer a value-based internet and telephone service allowing customers to enjoy digital connectivity, and in India we launched Flipkart Health+ enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country. Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help its various formats operate more efficiently, as well as to provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences. 9 Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Competition. Walmart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us. Distribution. We utilize a total of 188 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mexico and South Africa. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2023, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and distribution and fulfillment centers which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 100 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, more than 3,600 eCommerce sort centers and last-mile delivery facilities in India, as well as our physical retail stores. Sam's Club Segment Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club had net sales of $84.3 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 14% of our consolidated fiscal 2023 net sales, and had net sales of $73.6 billion and $63.9 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. Membership. The following two options are available to members: Plus Membership Club Membership Annual Membership Fee $110 $50 Number of Add-on Memberships ($45 each) Up to 16 Up to 8 All memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost. Plus Members are also eligible for free shipping on the majority of merchandise, with no minimum order size, and receive discounts on prescriptions and glasses. Beginning in fiscal 2023, Sam's Club launched a single loyalty rewards currency called Sam's Cash which merges and replaces existing Cash Rewards for Plus members and Cash Back for Sam's Club Mastercard holders. Members may redeem Sam's Cash on purchases in the club and online, to pay for membership fees or for cash in clubs. Sam's Cash does not expire and is available for monthly redemption. Omni-channel. Sam's Club provides an omni-channel experience to members, integrating warehouse clubs and eCommerce through such services as Curbside Pickup, mobile Scan & Go, ship-from-club, and delivery-from-club. Members have access to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, including those not found in our clubs, online at samsclub.com and through our mobile commerce applications. The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 32,000 and 168,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet. Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories: • Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items; • Fuel, tobacco and other categories; 10 • Home and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, tools and power equipment, housewares, toys, seasonal items, mattresses, and tire and battery centers; • Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services and over-the-counter drugs; and • Technology, office and entertainment includes consumer electronics and accessories, software, video games, office supplies, appliances, and third-party gift cards. Within the categories above, the Member's Mark private label brand continues to expand its assortment and deliver member value. Operations. Sam's Club is available to members through warehouse club locations, as well as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day. Club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before regular operating hours. Consistent with its strategy, Sam's Club continues to develop technology tools to drive a great member experience. Curbside Pickup is available at all clubs to help provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members. Sam's Club also offers ""Scan & Go,"" a mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete. Distribution. We utilize 29 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., as well as some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. During fiscal 2023, the majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were shipped directly to Sam's Club locations by suppliers. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs, 13 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers. Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport perishable and non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties. 11 Suppliers and Supply Chain As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the ""fresh"" category. Consistent with applicable laws, we offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access for example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members. Government Regulation As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in "" Item 1A. Risk Factors "" under the sub-caption ""Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks."" Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") Priorities Our ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long-term value and create competitive advantage for the Company by serving our stakeholders, including our customers, associates, shareholders, suppliers, business partners, and communities. We believe that addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business, including by enhancing customer and associate trust, creating new revenue streams, managing cost and risk, building capabilities for future advantage, and strengthening the underlying systems on which Walmart and our stakeholders rely. We prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value: issues that rank high in relevance to our business and stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned to make a positive impact. Our current ESG priorities are categorized into four broad themes: opportunity, sustainability, community, and ethics and integrity. • Opportunity . Retail can be a powerful engine for inclusive economic opportunity. We aim to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion, and create opportunity for Walmart associates (as further described in the Human Capital Management section below), our suppliers and workers in supply chains, and the communities in which we operate. Doing so helps us fulfill our customer mission, strengthens our business and helps people build a better life for themselves and their families. • Sustainability . Walmart's sustainability efforts focus on our ability to create and preserve long-term value for both people and planet. With respect to people, our sustainability efforts include sourcing responsibly, helping prevent forced labor, empowering women, creating inclusive economic opportunity and selling safer, healthier products. With respect to the planet, our efforts aim to enhance the sustainability of product supply chains by reducing emissions, protecting and restoring nature, and reducing waste. To help address the effects of climate change, Walmart has set science-based targets for emissions reduction, including our goal to achieve zero emissions in our operations by 2040—without offsets—and to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of emissions in our value chain by 2030 under our Project Gigaton™ initiative. • Community . Walmart aims to serve and strengthen communities by operating our business in a way that meets the needs of our customer and community stakeholder groups, including by providing safer, healthier and more affordable food and other products, disaster support, associate volunteerism, local grant programs and community cohesion initiatives. • Ethics and Integrity . At every level of our Company, we work to create a culture that inspires trust among our associates, with our customers, and in the communities we serve . We periodically publish information on our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and may update those disclosures from time to time. Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting, documents or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Human Capital Management At Walmart, we're committed to help people save money and live better around the world. This mission is delivered by our associates who make the difference for our millions of customers and members every day. As of the end of fiscal 2023, we 12 employed approximately 2.1 million associates worldwide, with approximately 1.6 million associates in the U.S. and approximately 0.5 million associates internationally. In the U.S., approximately 93% of our associates are hourly and approximately 70% of our associates are full-time. We know the success and progress we've seen this year and throughout our Company's history is because of our associates who work every day to fulfill our mission. That's why we're focused on providing opportunities for associates to grow and learn. For some, we are a foundational entry point to develop critical skills that are relevant for a variety of careers, and for others a place where associates can grow their careers across our global omni-channel business. No matter the role or location, we're focused on developing, rewarding, and retaining associates in an ever-changing environment. As customer expectations and technology change the nature of work, we know it's our people – our humanity – that will differentiate us from the competition, so this must be a top priority. Our workforce strategy includes the following strategic priorities: belonging, well-being, growth and digital. Belonging - Build a Walmart for everyone: a diverse, equitable and inclusive company, where associates' ideas and opinions matter . We are focused on having an inclusive culture where everyone feels they belong. We publish our diversity representation twice yearly, and hold ourselves accountable to providing recurring culture, diversity, equity, and inclusion updates to senior leadership, including our President and CEO, and members of the Board of Directors. Of the approximately 2.1 million associates employed worldwide, 52% identify as women. In the U.S., 50% of the approximately 1.6 million associates identify as people of color. We review our processes regarding our commitment to fair-pay practices. We are committed to creating a performance culture where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance, and the work they do. To build a company where associates feel engaged, valued and heard, we gather and respond to associates' feedback in a variety of ways, including but not limited to our annual associate engagement survey, our Open Door process, and one-on-one interactions. Management reviews the results of feedback obtained from our formal associate engagement survey. Well-being - Focus on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our associates. We invest in our associates by offering competitive wages, as well as a broad range of benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements. In the U.S., we offer affordable healthcare coverage to our full-time and eligible part-time associates as well as company paid benefits such as 401(k) match, family building support, maternity leave, a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates, paid time off, Associate Stock Purchase Plan match, life insurance, behavioral and mental health services, and a store discount card or Sam's Club membership. Additional information about how we invest in our associates' well-being, including wage structure and pay, can be found in our Human Capital brief in our most recent ESG reporting, which is available on our corporate website. Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting documents, or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Growth - Provide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue to attract talent with new skills. We are invested in the growth of our associates in support of our business and their success by offering good jobs that lead to great careers and better lives. We launched the global Walmart Academy to help associates build and grow their careers, creating one of the largest learning ecosystems in the world. The global Walmart Academy offers training for on-the-job retail skills, leadership courses, and well-being training, serving associates through combination of digital and in-person offerings. The global focus builds on moving much more to a learning in the flow of work approach. We also provide access to educational opportunities for our part-time and full-time frontline eligible associates in the U.S. through our Live Better U program, which provides access to earn a high school diploma or a college degree. Walmart pays 100% of associates' college tuition, books and fees. Our Live Better U program aligns education offerings with Walmart's own areas of growth, providing opportunities for associates to become great at the job they have today and prepare for the job of tomorrow. Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers in hourly positions. Our focus on providing a path of opportunity for our associates through robust training, competitive wages and benefits, and career advancement creates a strong associate value proposition and strengthens our workforce. Digital - Accelerate digital transformation and ways of working to improve the associate experience and drive business results . To deliver a seamless customer and associate experience, we continue to invest in digital tools like Me@Walmart, MyClub and Me@Campus to improve associate productivity, engagement, and performance. The MyFeedback app was developed to capture real-time associate feedback. Walmart supports associates who are on the U.S. Medical Plan with free virtual visits which include visits for medical doctor urgent care, along with mental health care with psychiatrist and psychologists. 13 Information About Our Executive Officers The following chart names the executive officers of the Company as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, each of whom is elected by and serves at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.

RISK FACTORS The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face. Strategic Risks Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance. The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate. Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, supply chain automation, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and interconnected ecosystem for our customers that deepens and maintains our relationships with our customers across our various businesses and partnerships and reinforces our overall enterprise strategy. The success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A . With the interconnected components of this enterprise strategy and an increasing allocation of capital expenditures focused on these initiatives, changes in customer or member perceptions about our reputation or our failure to successfully execute on individual components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance. Furthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, automation, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term. If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and services and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those related to ESG issues) and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business. We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers, and other businesses which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, social commerce platforms, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. The omni-channel retail landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded competitors may increase competitive 15 pressures. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets in which we operate, omni-channel innovations and omni-channel ecosystems developed by our competitors or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See "" Item 1. Business "" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments. Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to bankruptcy, consolidation or other factors. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-channel ecosystems, or reductions in operations may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our financial performance. General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets. In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, including energy prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our business. These arrangements (such as ONE, our fintech joint venture, and our healthcare initiative with UnitedHealth Group) may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, business relationship or in certain of our recently divested markets, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 16 Operational Risks Global or regional health pandemics or epidemics, including COVID-19, could negatively impact our business, financial position and results of operations. The emergence, severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional pandemics or epidemics are uncertain and difficult to predict. A pandemic, such as COVID-19, or other epidemic could impact our business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the spread of a virus or other disease (such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions on retailers), our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. Customer behaviors changed rapidly during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a resurgence of infections or future mutations, variants or related strains of the virus become prevalent, customer demand for certain products may fluctuate and customer behaviors may change, which may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors may result in higher demand for certain products and less demand for others, as well as out-of-stock positions in certain products, along with delays in delivering those products (due to supply chain and transportation issues) and could impact inventory levels in the future. Other factors and uncertainties may include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we and our suppliers operate; further increased operational costs; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatments, including for any variants; the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and the long-term impact of the pandemic or epidemic on our business, including consumer behaviors. These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global economy, or a future pandemic or epidemic occurs, such events may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements. Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, global health epidemics or pandemics, catastrophic and other events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical tensions or events; regional or global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (such as COVID-19); and catastrophic and other events, such as war, civil unrest (including theft, looting or vandalism), terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), or the loss of merchandise as a result of shrink or theft in countries in which we operate, in which our suppliers are located, or in other areas of the world (such as in Ukraine where a war currently exists between Ukraine and Russia) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of either reduced availability or economic sanctions, increased transportation costs (whether due to fuel prices, fuel supply, or otherwise), the disruption (whether directly or indirectly) of critical infrastructure systems, banking systems, utility services or energy availability to our stores, clubs and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores, clubs and our other facilities. Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions, drought, or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs, and distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; and heat and extreme weather 17 events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which Walmart operates. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs. We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers; theft, loss or spoilage of inventory; and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, our operations in the U.S. comprise a significant portion of our financial and operational performance. Therefore, any of the above matters that uniquely impact or are specifically concentrated in the U.S. could materially adversely affect our financial and operational performance . Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control (such as, for example, the factors that occurred with respect to the availability of supply for baby formula during the prior fiscal year). In addition, U.S. and international trade policies, tariffs and other restrictions on the exportation and importation of goods, trade sanctions imposed between certain countries and entities, the limitation on the exportation or importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to these marketplace transactions, including, but not limited to, intellectual property and products liability laws, apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes or interpretations could expose us to liability, loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law or the proprietary rights of others. Although we have marketplace compliance controls and impose contractual terms on sellers to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect certain prohibited items, enforce such terms, or collect sufficient damages for breaches. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and enterprise strategy. 18 We rely extensively on information and financial systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations. Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security incidents and breaches (including through cyberattacks, which may be from cybercriminals or sophisticated state-sponsored threat actors), catastrophic events such as fires, major or extended winter storms, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by our associates or contractors, civil or political unrest, or armed hostilities. Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. Our information systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, breached, attacked, interrupted, or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we frequently update our information technology hardware, software, processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely or successfully integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. For example, during the first quarter of fiscal year ending January 31, 2024, we initiated an upgrade to our existing financial system, including our general ledger and other applications. If we are unable to implement this upgrade as planned, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected; our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed; and our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be negatively impacted. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online and enable us to deliver products and services do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media, online advertising, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and shipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world, and we continue to make investments in supply chain automation to support our omni-channel strategy. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Moreover, some of the various technology systems and services on which we rely are provided and managed by third-party service providers. To the extent either our or such other third-party systems and services do not perform or function as anticipated, whether because of an inherent flaw in the technology or a faulty implementation, such failure can significantly interfere with our ability to meet our customers' changing expectations. Any disruption or failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly, and secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise and services at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology in a cost-efficient manner could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems used in our acquired eCommerce, technology or other businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' information including personal information and/or payment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A . Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse and/or loss, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity, and our ability to efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers, members or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business. 19 Any failure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates, business partners and vendors, whether as a result of cyberattacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, result in fines, penalties, and liability, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Like most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information and/or payment information about our customers and members, and we also receive and store information concerning our associates and vendors. In addition, our health and wellness business operations, the Walmart Health locations, and third-party service providers who handle information on our behalf, store and maintain personal health information. Some of this information is stored digitally in connection with the digital platforms and technologies that we use to conduct and facilitate our various businesses. We utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates, business partners or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent. Attacks against information systems and devices, whether our own or those of our third-party service providers, create risk of cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware, malware, or phishing incidents. We expect to continue to experience such attempted attacks in the future. Cyberattacks and threat actors can be sponsored by particular countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, phishing incidents, worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and disruptions. Mitigation and remediation recommendations continue to evolve, and addressing vulnerabilities is a priority for us. The increased use of remote work infrastructure in recent years has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Some of our systems and third-party service providers' systems have experienced security incidents or breaches and although they have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a compromise or breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. Any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions (including, with respect to health information, liability under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or ""HIPAA""), customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security event, breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, members, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. Our compliance programs, information technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk. Disruptions in our systems caused by security incidents, breaches or cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do business with (such as strategic partners, suppliers, banks, or utility companies) – could harm our ability to conduct our operations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our partners, third-party service providers, customers, members, financial services firms, and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis. Our reputation with our customers and members is important to the success of our enterprise strategy, which combines traditional retail, membership models, marketplaces, financial services, healthcare, and other customer and business services into a series of interconnected assets to make it seamless for customers to interact with us. Security-related events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting 20 our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial position and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security compromise or ransomware event could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, electronic benefits transfer (EBT) cards, mobile payments, and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security incidents, breaches, or other compromises from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be developed in the future. In certain circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. Additionally, through various financial service partners and our ONE fintech joint venture, we offer various services such as money transfers, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders, check cashing, prepaid access, co-branded credits cards, installment lending, and earned wage access. These products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including privacy, authentication and tokenization, global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation. The Company also has compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and transfer of personal information, which include liability for security and privacy breaches. Among other obligations, breaches may trigger obligations under international, federal and state laws to notify affected individuals, government agencies and the media. Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subject us to fines, sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation. Changes in type or scope of offerings of our health and wellness business or the Walmart Health business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments across the U.S. and in various of our international markets such as Canada and Mexico. We also provide management services to Walmart Health centers that offer medical, dental, behavioral health and other health services in a number of states, as well as a national telehealth service provider. In addition, Walmart's 10-year collaboration with UnitedHealth Group includes agreements for Walmart Health to provide value-based care to patients in certain areas of the U.S., among other initiatives. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (""PBMs""). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options and/or home delivery options; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use of third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and any 21 additional changes in the state or federal regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of health reform efforts, and other changes to or novel interpretations of existing state or federal laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business. If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies. Walmart Health clinical operations are also subject to numerous risks, including but not limited to: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for services; changes in our payer mix; changes in the health insurance market generally; our inability to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans; competition for patients from other healthcare providers, including those that offer telehealth services; changes to healthcare provider utilization practices and treatment methodologies; trends toward value-based purchasing and price transparency; overall economic conditions and the ability of patients to pay for services; staffing challenges, including retention of a sufficient number and quality of healthcare professionals; compliance with the complex and extensive laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry; changes in laws and regulations, including as a result of health reform efforts; and healthcare technology initiatives, including those related to patient data and interoperability; and public health conditions. One or a combination of the factors above may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities. In addition, these and other factors may adversely affect the type, volume and mix of services we provide, the reimbursement we receive for health and wellness services rendered, and the scope and pace of expansion of Walmart Health and related offerings. Any of these developments could, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including our enterprise strategy and management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. We compete for talent with other retail and non-retail businesses, including, for example, technology, health and wellness, and fintech businesses, and invest significant resources in training and motivating our associates. Increased competition among potential employers at all levels, including senior management and executive levels, could result in increased associate costs or make it more difficult to recruit and retain associates. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new, revised, or novel interpretations of existing labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Financial Risks Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, capital expenditures, comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts or, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock. 22 Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations. Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations. We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations. Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance. In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. During fiscal 2023, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 17% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures or nationalization), antitrust and competition law regulatory matters (such as the competition investigations currently underway in Mexico related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico, in Canada related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart Canada and competition proceedings in India related to our Flipkart subsidiary), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, foreign exchange or currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and regulations of other countries. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance 23 programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance. In fiscal 2023, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 83% of our consolidated net sales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. and international operations as well as our business. We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles. We are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, any of which can impact our current and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act"") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any other new tax rules, regulations, guidance, and interpretations, including collecting information not regularly produced by the Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations. In addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to or seek to enforce novel interpretations of their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the ""OECD""), the European Union and other countries (including countries in which we operate) have committed to enacting substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. In particular, the OECD's Pillar Two initiative introduces a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis and for which many jurisdictions have now committed to an effective enactment date starting January 1, 2024. The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate. Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made. Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws, regulations, and interpretations of such laws and regulations specific to the businesses and jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance. We operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate and could be materially adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. In addition, the degree of regulatory, political, and media scrutiny we face increases the likelihood that our efforts to adhere our practices and procedures to comply with these laws and legal requirements may be subject to frequent or increasing challenges. Our health and wellness operations in the U.S. and the operations of the Walmart Health locations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, those related to: licensing, reimbursement arrangements, and other requirements and restrictions; registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; governmental and commercial reimbursement (including Medicare and Medicaid); data privacy and security and the sharing and interoperability of data, including obligations and restrictions related to health information (such as those imposed under HIPAA); billing and coding for healthcare services and properly handling overpayments; debt collection; necessity and adequacy of healthcare services; relationships with referral sources and referral recipients and other fraud and abuse issues, such as those addressed by anti-kickback and false claims laws and patient inducement regulations; qualification of healthcare practitioners; quality and standards of medical services and 24 equipment; and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, medical, dental, and behavioral healthcare services, including limitations on the corporate practice of medicine in certain states. Health-related legislation at the federal and state level may have an adverse effect on our business or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations. For example, in the U.S., the Drug Enforcement Administration (""DEA"") and various other regulatory authorities regulate the purchase, distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. In addition, there has been recent heightened governmental and public scrutiny of pharmaceutical product pricing, which has resulted in federal and state legislation and regulations, executive orders and other initiatives and proposals designed to increase transparency in pharmaceutical product pricing and reform government program reimbursement methodologies (for example, the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes, among other matters, policies designed to impact drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government). Other health reform efforts at the federal and state levels may also impact our business or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations. We may not be able to predict the nature or success of reform initiatives, and the resulting uncertainties may have an adverse effect on our business. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters; protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; food and drug safety, including drug supply chain security requirements; trade, consumer protection, and safety, including the availability, sale, price label accuracy, advertisement, and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer (including through our digital channels, stores and clubs as well as our ONE fintech joint venture); anti-money laundering prohibitions; consumer financial protection laws; economic, trade, and other sanctions matters; licensure, certification, and enrollment with government programs; data privacy and security and the sharing and interoperability of data; working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters; and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protections laws and U.S. sanctions. Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence, and disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability (including with respect to our supply chain), natural resources, waste reduction, energy, human capital, and risk oversight could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. Moreover, we are also subject to data privacy and protection laws regulating the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA""), which was significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (""CPRA""), new comprehensive privacy legislation passed in Connecticut (the Connecticut Data Protection Act), Colorado (the Colorado Privacy Act), Utah (the Utah Privacy Act) and Virginia (the Consumer Data Protection Act), each of which go into effect in 2023, as well as other laws and regulations such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), the United Kingdom's General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), China's Personal Information Protection Act, and similar legislation in Quebec (An Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of personal information, SQ 2021, c 25). The potential effects of these laws are far-reaching, continue to evolve, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. These and other privacy and cybersecurity laws may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance. For example, in the case of non-compliance with a material provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover in the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach. Residents in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws have expanded rights to access, correct and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. Laws such as those in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Utah, and Virginia may allow civil penalties for violations, and CCPA and CPRA provide a private right of action for data breaches. Furthermore, our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. We may be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including changing some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity, impact our reputation and could require a costly response from and defense by us. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny as to existing laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, in the U.S., shifting enforcement priorities for existing antitrust, competition, and pricing laws, as well as proposed new rules and regulations) generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices of 25 existing laws and regulations may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. If we fail to predict or respond adequately to changes, including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives, or do not respond as effectively as our competitors, our business, operations, and financial performance may be adversely affected. In addition, we may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The regulatory, political, and media scrutiny we face, which may continue, amplifies these risks. To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required licenses and certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug suppliers and third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages. Failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and results of operations. We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental authorities. We may also have indemnification obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collective-action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws. The Company has been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and also is a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids, including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Similar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, healthcare providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters. In addition, in July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart and other parties requesting the recipients show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations that related to a period prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification, and can provide no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its consolidated financial statements. The Company is also a defendant in litigation with the Federal Trade Commission regarding the Company's money transfer agent services and is also cooperating with and responding to subpoenas issued by the U.S Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or investigations or any other related actions by governmental entities regarding these matters and can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. We discuss in more detail these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption ""Item 3. Legal Proceedings"" and in Note 10 in the ""Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements,"" which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 26 Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our shareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. The exclusive forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under, the federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we are not able to achieve our ESG goals. We strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make significant progress in certain ESG priority issue areas. From time to time, we announce certain aspirations and goals relevant to our priority ESG issues. We periodically publish information about our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and update our ESG reporting from time to time. Achievement of these aspirations and goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in the achievement of our ESG goals or that certain of our customers, associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations might not be satisfied with our goals or our efforts toward achieving those goals. Certain challenges we face in the achievement of our ESG objectives are also captured within our ESG reporting, which is not incorporated by reference into and does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A failure or perceived failure to meet our goals could adversely affect public perception of our business, associate morale or customer or shareholder support. ITEM 1B.

All store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based on sales volume. Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some of which include rent escalation clauses. For further information on our distribution centers, see the caption ""Distribution"" provided for each of our segments under "" Item 1. Business ."" 30 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in "" Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ,"" which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings."" We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of March 3, 2023. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $651 million over fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The Company has filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive portion of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. The MDL has designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery. In addition, there are over 300 other cases pending in state and federal courts throughout the country as of March 3, 2023. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable, are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. Opioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a Settlement Framework to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as described above), as described in more detail in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company now has settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits brought by state and local governments against the Company. The settlement will take effect if a sufficient number of political subdivisions also join. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed the Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion remains pending. Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation : Three derivative complaints and two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the amended complaint. The court held a hearing on that motion on September 26, 2022; a ruling remains pending. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, purport to be filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016, through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v. McMillon et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 4/16/21: Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund et al. v. Walton et al., DE Court of Chancery, 9/27/21. 31 Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and Martin v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC , Dist. of DE, 3/5/21, consolidated into In re Walmart Inc. Securities Litigation , USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21. ASDA Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v. ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others – Manchester Employment Tribunal); Abbas & Others v Asda Stores limited (KB-2022-003243); and Abusubih & Others v Asda Stores limited (KB-2022-003240). Money Transfer Agent Services Litigation: Federal Trade Commission v. Walmart Inc. (CV-3372), USDC, N. Dist. Of Ill, 6/28/22. II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS: Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (""Flipkart""), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the ""Rules"") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its consolidated financial statements. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million. In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc., and a trial date has been scheduled for April 22, 2024. The Company believes the suit is without merit and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market for Common Stock The principal market on which Walmart's common stock is listed for trading is the New York Stock Exchange. The common stock trades under the symbol ""WMT."" Holders of Record of Common Stock As of March 15, 2023, there were 205,465 holders of record of Walmart's common stock. Stock Performance Chart This graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on Walmart's common stock during the five fiscal years ended through fiscal 2023 to the cumulative total returns on the S&P 500 Retailing Index and the S&P 500 Index. The comparison assumes $100 was invested on February 1, 2018 in shares of our common stock and in each of the indices shown and assumes that all of the dividends were reinvested. *Assumes $100 Invested on February 1, 2018 Assumes Dividends Reinvested Fiscal Year ended January 31, 2023 Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Walmart Inc. $ 100.00 $ 92.03 $ 112.17 $ 139.96 $ 141.50 $ 147.89 S&P 500 Index 100.00 97.69 118.87 139.37 171.83 157.71 S&P 500 Retailing Index 100.00 108.42 127.45 180.19 195.77 160.10 Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to November 21, 2022 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. In November 2022, the Company approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which, beginning on November 21, 2022, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of January 31, 2023, authorization for $19.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. 33 Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase programs, on a trade date basis, for each month in the quarter ended January 31, 2023, was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Repurchased Average Price Paid per Share (in dollars) Total Number of Shares Repurchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Repurchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (in billions) November 1-30, 2022 3,972,269 $ 144.52 3,972,269 $ 19.9 December 1-31, 2022 2,035,515 145.82 2,035,515 19.6 January 1-31, 2023 2,108,707 143.15 2,108,707 19.3 Total 8,116,491 8,116,491 (1) Represents the approximate dollar value of shares that could have been repurchased under the current plan at the end of the month. The approximate dollar value of shares that could still have been purchased under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022, as of November 21, 2022, when such plan was replaced, was $1.4 billion. ITEM 6. RESERVED 34 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023""), January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022"") and January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021""), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial position and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our flywheel strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. We have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our portfolio, primarily in the Walmart International segment, including the following highlights over the last three years: • In November 2020, we completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and recorded a pre-tax non-cash loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.0 billion, primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation losses. Refer to Note 12 . • In February 2021, we completed the sale of Asda for net consideration of $9.6 billion, for which we recognized an estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $5.5 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction. Refer to Note 11 and Note 12 . • In March 2021, we completed the sale of Seiyu for net consideration of $1.2 billion, for which we recognized an estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.9 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction. Refer to Note 12 . • In November 2022, we completed the buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary (Refer to Note 3 ) and in December 2022, we exited operations in certain countries in Africa. • In December 2022, we increased our ownership in PhonePe as part of the separation from our majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. Refer to Note 3 . We operate in a highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services, advertising, and data service businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce 35 presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates. We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain, inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, inflation, deflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under "" Item 1A. Risk Factors ."" We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. However, like other retail companies, we have seen supply chain disruptions contributing to higher than normal inventory levels throughout the year. In addition, our merchandise costs for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 have been impacted by high inflation, greater than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross profit margin is influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include, but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales. We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to pressure from inflation; swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer confidence; volatility in employment trends; supply chain pressures; and ongoing uncertainties related to global health epidemics or pandemics, any of which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expanding omni-channel initiatives that complement our flywheel strategy. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. Calendar comparable sales, including the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2023 and 2022, were as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 7.0% 6.4% 0.4% 0.3% Sam's Club 14.6% 15.0% 4.2% 5.5% Total U.S. 8.2% 7.7% 1.0% 1.2% Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 8.2% and 7.7% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. comparable sales increased 7.0% and 6.4% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. For 36 fiscal 2023, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions. For fiscal 2022, comparable sales growth was driven driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which included strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales for both fiscal 2023 and 2022 as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. Comparable sales at Sam's Club increased 14.6% and 15.0% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. For fiscal 2023, Sam's Club comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. Sam's Club comparable sales for fiscal 2022 benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and was aided by consumer spending due to government stimulus, and also included some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.8% and 1.3% to comparable sales for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 Net sales $ 605,881 $ 567,762 Percentage change from comparable period 6.7 % 2.3 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 127,140 $ 117,812 Percentage change from comparable period 7.9 % 1.3 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.0 % 20.8 % For fiscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 23 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were impacted by charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and charges of $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment. These charges were partially offset by growth in net sales and lower incremental COVID-19 costs. For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $2.5 billion as compared to the previous year, partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment. Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As such, we continue to allocate more capital to supply chain, omni-channel initiatives, technology and store remodels and less to new store and club openings. The following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Fiscal Years Ended January 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2023 2022 Supply chain, customer-facing initiatives and technology $ 9,209 $ 7,197 Store and club remodels 4,990 3,278 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 33 134 Total U.S. $ 14,232 $ 10,609 Walmart International 2,625 2,497 Total capital expenditures $ 16,857 $ 13,106 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics 37 to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 4.6% and 5.6% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the decrease in net income, which was driven by lower operating income, partially offset by lapping debt extinguishment charges . ROI was 12.7% and 14.9% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, which was primarily due to a decrease in operating income which included charges associated with opioid-related legal settlements as well as reorganization and restructuring expenses, all recorded in fiscal 2023. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 11,292 $ 13,940 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 244,029 $ 248,678 Return on assets (ROA) 4.6 % 5.6 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 20,428 $ 25,942 + Interest income 254 158 + Depreciation and amortization 10,945 10,658 + Rent 2,306 2,274 ROI operating income $ 33,933 $ 39,032 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 244,029 $ 248,678 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 106,249 98,199 - Average accounts payable (1) 54,502 52,201 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 28,593 32,013 Average invested capital $ 267,183 $ 262,663 Return on investment (ROI) 12.7 % 14.9 % (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. As of January 31, 2023 2022 2021 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 243,197 $ 244,860 $ 252,496 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 110,286 102,211 94,187 Accounts payable 53,742 55,261 49,141 Accrued liabilities 31,126 26,060 37,966 38 Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See "" Liquidity and Capital Resources "" for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $28.8 billion, $24.2 billion and $36.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $12.0 billion, $11.1 billion and $25.8 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to fiscal 2022. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by a decline in operating income and the timing of certain payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to fiscal 2022 due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $3.8 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 due to the same reasons as the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $2.8 billion in increased capital expenditures. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 28,841 $ 24,181 $ 36,074 Payments for property and equipment (16,857) (13,106) (10,264) Free cash flow $ 11,984 $ 11,075 $ 25,810 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (17,722) $ (6,015) $ (10,071) Net cash used in financing activities (17,039) (22,828) (16,117) (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 39 Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2021 Total revenues $ 611,289 $ 572,754 $ 559,151 Percentage change from comparable period 6.7 % 2.4 % 6.7 % Net sales $ 605,881 $ 567,762 $ 555,233 Percentage change from comparable period 6.7 % 2.3 % 6.8 % Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 8.2 % 7.7 % 8.7 % Gross profit rate 23.5 % 24.4 % 24.3 % Operating income $ 20,428 $ 25,942 $ 22,548 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.4 % 4.6 % 4.1 % Loss on extinguishment of debt $ — $ 2,410 $ — Other (gains) and losses $ 1,538 $ 3,000 $ (210) Consolidated net income $ 11,292 $ 13,940 $ 13,706 Unit counts at period end (1) 10,623 10,593 11,443 Retail square feet at period end (1) 1,056 1,060 1,121 (1) Unit counts and associated retail square feet are presented for stores and clubs generally open as of period end, and reflects the removal of stores in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to closing the divestitures in fiscal 2022. Permanently closed locations are not included in these metrics. Our total revenues, which includes net sales and membership and other income, increased $38.5 billion or 6.7% and $13.6 billion or 2.4% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenues were primarily due to increases in net sales, which increased $38.1 billion or 6.7% and $12.5 billion or 2.3% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which was driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions, along with positive comparable sales in all of our international markets. Additionally, net sales were negatively impacted by a decrease of $5.0 billion related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and $3.7 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club which benefited from strong U.S. consumer spending and some inflation, along with positive comparable sales in most of our remaining international markets. The increase was partially offset by a $32.6 billion net sales decrease primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net sales also benefited from a $4.5 billion positive impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2022. Our gross profit rate decreased 98 and increased 14 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, the decrease was primarily due to markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S., higher supply chain costs and inflation related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost inflation as well as merchandise mix, partially offset by increased supply chain costs. For fiscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 23 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were impacted by charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and charges of $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment. These charges were partially offset by growth in net sales and lower incremental COVID-19 costs. For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $2.5 billion as compared to the previous year, partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022 due to the early retirement of certain higher rate long-term debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. Other gains and losses consisted of a net loss of $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The net loss in fiscal 2023 primarily consists of: (a) net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity and other investments; (b) a gain of $0.4 billion recognized on the sale of our remaining equity method investment in Brazil; and (c) a $0.2 billion dividend from one of our investments. The net loss in fiscal 2022 primarily consists of net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, as well as $0.4 billion in incremental losses associated with the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 40 Our effective income tax rate was 33.6% for fiscal 2023, 25.4% for fiscal 2022, and 33.3% for fiscal 2021, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 is primarily due to the tax impact of the business reorganization resulting in the full separation of PhonePe from Flipkart. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 is primarily due to the $8.3 billion loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021, which provided minimal realizable tax benefit. Our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 is presented in Note 9 . As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $11.3 billion and $13.9 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, which represents a decrease of $2.6 billion and an increase of $0.2 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart (""EPS"") was $4.27, $4.87 and $4.75 for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Walmart U.S. Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2021 Net sales $ 420,553 $ 393,247 $ 369,963 Percentage change from comparable period 6.9 % 6.3 % 8.5 % Calendar comparable sales increase 7.0 % 6.4 % 8.7 % Operating income $ 20,620 $ 21,587 $ 19,116 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.9 % 5.5 % 5.2 % Unit counts at period end 4,717 4,742 4,743 Retail square feet at period end 702 703 703 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $27.3 billion or 6.9% and $23.3 billion or 6.3% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable sales of 7.0% and 6.4% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Comparable sales in fiscal 2023 were driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions. Comparable sales in fiscal 2022 were driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which included strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales for both fiscal 2023 and 2022, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. Gross profit rate decreased 85 basis points for fiscal 2023 and increased 51 basis points for fiscal 2022, when compared to the respective previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2023 gross profit rate was primarily due to net markdowns and product mix shifts into lower margin categories and increased supply chain costs, partially offset by price management impacts driven by cost inflation. Gross profit rate for fiscal 2022 benefited from price management driven by cost inflation as well as merchandise mix, which includes lapping the temporary closures of our Auto Care and Vision Centers and growth in our advertising business, partially offset by increased supply chain costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 25 basis points for fiscal 2023 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily driven by strong sales growth and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by increased wage costs. For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 31 basis points primarily due to investments in wages, partially offset by lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $1.9 billion. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $1.0 billion and increased $2.5 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. 41 Walmart International Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2021 Net sales $ 100,983 $ 100,959 $ 121,360 Percentage change from comparable period — % (16.8) % 1.0 % Operating income $ 2,965 $ 3,758 $ 3,660 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.9 % 3.7 % 3.0 % Unit counts at period end 5,306 5,251 6,101 Retail square feet at period end 273 277 337 Net sales for the Walmart International segment were flat and decreased $20.4 billion or 16.8% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, net sales benefited from positive comparable sales in all of our international markets, offset by the impacts of a decrease of $5.0 billion related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as well as $3.7 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2022, the reduction in net sales was driven by a $32.6 billion decrease primarily related to the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This decrease was partially offset by positive comparable sales in most of our remaining markets, as well as positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.5 billion. Gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points and 55 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, the decrease was primarily driven by continued growth in lower margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower margin categories. For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats and the impact related to our divested markets. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 41 basis points and decreased 71 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to business reorganization and restructuring charges incurred related to Flipkart and Massmart during the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily due to impacts from the divested markets and $0.4 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $0.8 billion and increased $0.1 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Sam's Club Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2021 Including Fuel Net sales $ 84,345 $ 73,556 $ 63,910 Percentage change from comparable period 14.7 % 15.1 % 8.7 % Calendar comparable sales increase 14.6 % 15.0 % 8.7 % Operating income $ 1,964 $ 2,259 $ 1,906 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.3 % 3.1 % 3.0 % Unit counts at period end 600 600 599 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 71,665 $ 64,860 $ 59,184 Percentage change from comparable period 10.5 % 9.6 % 12.1 % Operating income $ 1,352 $ 1,923 $ 1,645 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 1.9 % 3.0 % 2.8 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $10.8 billion or 14.7% and $9.6 billion or 15.1% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 14.6%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.8% to comparable sales which was primarily driven by ship to home and curbside pickup. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some 42 higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales. Gross profit rate decreased 155 basis points and 68 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2023, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to inventory write-downs, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs and inflation related LIFO charges. For fiscal 2022 , gross profit rate decreased primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales. Membership and other income increased 7.0% and 13.1% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the increase was primarily due to increases in new member sign-ups and Plus member penetration. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 97 basis points and 82 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2023 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales. Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $0.3 billion and increased $0.4 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 28,841 $ 24,181 $ 36,074 Net cash provided by operating activities was $28.8 billion, $24.2 billion and $36.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by a decline in operating income and the timing of certain payments. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $8.6 billion and $14.8 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our working capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $16.5 billion and $6.3 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in our working capital deficit is primarily driven by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in accrued liabilities. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. We do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial position or results of operations. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders. 43 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Net cash used in investing activities $ (17,722) $ (6,015) $ (10,071) Net cash used in investing activities was $17.7 billion , $6.0 billion and $10.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and generally consisted of capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities increased $11.7 billion for fiscal 2023 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the result of lapping the net proceeds received from the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan and an increase in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4.1 billion for fiscal 2022 when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to the net proceeds received from the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, partially offset by increased capital expenditures. Capital expenditures Refer to the "" Strategic Capital Allocation "" section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2023 and 2022. For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024 (""fiscal 2024""), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $17 billion to $18 billion, with a focus on technology, supply chain, and customer-facing initiatives. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Net cash used in financing activities $ (17,039) $ (22,828) $ (16,117) Net cash from financing activities generally consists of debt transactions, dividends paid, repurchases of Company stock and transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders. Fiscal 2023 net cash used in financing activities decreased $5.8 billion when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease is primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and related payment of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes in the prior fiscal period, partially offset by the equity funding from the sale of subsidiary stock in the prior fiscal period. Fiscal 2022 net cash used in financing activities increased $6.7 billion when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and related payment of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes, as well as increased share repurchases, partially offset by long-term debt issuances and equity funding from the sale of subsidiary stock. Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Stoc k In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's Massmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership of Massmart from approximately 53% to 100%. Additionally, the Company completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously consolidated as a variable interest entity and resulted in the Company becoming a 100% owner. During fiscal 2022, the Company received $3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary, which reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 83% as of January 31, 2021 to approximately 75%. Short-term Borrowings We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end $ 11,432 $ 716 $ 4,048 Average daily short-term borrowings 7,250 626 1,577 Annual weighted-average interest rate 2.4 % 3.7 % 3.1 % Short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.4 billion, with weighted-average interest rates of 6.6% and 2.9%, respectively. We also have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. as of January 31, 2023 that provide additional liquidity, if needed. Additionally, we maintain access to various credit facilities outside of the U.S. to further support our Walmart International segment operations, as needed. As of January 31, 2023, we have $2.1 billion of syndicated and fronted letters of credit available, of which $1.8 billion was drawn and represents an unrecorded current obligation. 44 Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2023: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2022 $ 2,803 $ 34,864 $ 37,667 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 5,041 5,041 Repayments of long-term debt (2,689) — (2,689) Reclassifications of long-term debt 4,197 (4,197) — Currency and other adjustments (120) (1,059) (1,179) Balances as of January 31, 2023 $ 4,191 $ 34,649 $ 38,840 Our total outstanding long-term debt increased $1.2 billion during fiscal 2023, primarily due to the issuance of new long-term debt in September 2022, partially offset by the maturities of certain long-term debt. Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the issuances of long-term debt. Estimated contractual interest payments associated with our long-term debt amount to $18.8 billion, with approximately $1.7 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2024. Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2023 and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate instruments. Dividends Our total dividend payments were $6.1 billion , $6.2 billion and $6.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Effective February 21, 2023, the Company approved the fiscal 2024 annual dividend of $2.28 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share. For fiscal 2024, the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.57 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 17, 2023 April 3, 2023 May 5, 2023 May 30, 2023 August 11, 2023 September 5, 2023 December 8, 2023 January 2, 2024 Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to November 21, 2022 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. In November 2022, the Company approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which, beginning on November 21, 2022, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of January 31, 2023, authorization for $ 19.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021 Total number of shares repurchased 73.9 69.7 19.4 Average price paid per share $ 134.17 $ 140.45 $ 135.20 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 9,920 $ 9,787 $ 2,625 Material Cash Requirements Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include opioid and other legal settlements, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, purchases of subsidiary stock and purchase obligations. See Note 3 , Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding purchase of subsidiary stock, outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively. 45 As of January 31, 2023, the Company has $33.3 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $11.6 billion is due within one year. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the obligations quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also excluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Capital Resources We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2023, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. 46 Other Matters In Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies"" and appears in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption "" Item 8.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates. Management continually reviews our accounting policies including how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. Inventories The Walmart U.S. segment comprises the largest portion of our inventory and is primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") valuation method. The majority of the Sam's Club segment inventories are accounted for and valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. As a measure of sensitivity, an incremental 1% inflationary impact to the cost of our inventory purchases would not have resulted in a material increase to the LIFO provision recorded during fiscal 2023. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. Indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. Contingencies We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of 47 amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Taxes Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on estimates. As guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair values of certain equity and equity method investments measured on a recurring basis. The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2023, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased $0.6 billion primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2023. 48 Expected Maturity Date (Amounts in millions) Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2026 Fiscal 2027 Fiscal 2028 Thereafter Total Liabilities Short-term borrowings: Variable rate $ 372 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 372 Weighted-average interest rate 6.6 % — % — % — % — % — % 6.6 % Long-term debt (1) : Fixed rate $ 4,191 $ 3,516 $ 2,604 $ 2,737 $ 1,817 $ 23,975 $ 38,840 Weighted-average interest rate 3.2 % 2.9 % 3.8 % 2.0 % 3.5 % 4.3 % 3.8 % Interest rate derivatives Interest rate swaps: Fixed to variable $ 1,750 $ 1,500 $ — $ — $ — $ 4,771 $ 8,021 Weighted-average pay rate 5.2 % 5.9 % — % — % — % 5.8 % 5.7 % Weighted-average receive rate 2.6 % 3.3 % — % — % — % 2.5 % 2.7 % (1) Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt. As of January 31, 2023, our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 21% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2023 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $0.1 billion. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments and operations in countries other than the U.S., as well as our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt. For fiscal 2023, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets resulted in the $1.1 billion net loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss. We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain currencies in fiscal 2023. The hypothetical result of a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $0.7 billion. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2023 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $0.1 billion. In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies. Investment Risk We are exposed to investment risk primarily related to changes in the fair value of equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where we have elected the fair value option measured on a recurring basis. These changes in fair value are recorded within other gains and losses and resulted in a loss of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2023 primarily due to net decreases in the underlying stock prices of those investments. As of January 31, 2023, the fair value of our equity investments, including certain equity method investments, measured on a recurring basis was $10.7 billion. As of January 31, 2023, a hypothetical 10% change in the stock price of such investments would have changed the fair value of such investments by approximately $1.1 billion. 49 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. For the Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 Table of Contents Page Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 42 ) 51 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 53 Consolidated Statements of Income 54 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 55 Consolidated Balance Sheets 56 Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity 57 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 58 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 59 50 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""Consolidated Financial Statements""). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Contingencies Description of the Matter As described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at January 31, 2023, the Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when management determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. In assessing the probability of occurrence and whether an estimate of loss can be reasonably estimated for a particular legal proceeding, management exercises judgment on matters relevant to each proceeding, such as whether sufficient participation in settlement proceedings will occur, or whether it can predict the number of claims that may be filed. For example, management exercised judgment in accruing a liability for approximately $3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework and other previously agreed state and tribal settlements regarding opioid-related lawsuits. Auditing management's accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our assessment of the significant judgments made by management when assessing the probability of occurrence for contingencies or when determining whether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made. 51 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and evaluation of contingencies. For example, we tested controls over the Company's assessment of the likelihood of loss and the Company's determinations regarding the measurement of loss. To test the Company's assessment of the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, among other procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors and committees of the board of directors, reviewed documents provided to the Company by certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and outside legal counsel, and evaluated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal and outside legal counsel. As part of this assessment, we evaluated management's assumptions and calculations by, among other things, comparing those assumptions to key terms in the Settlement Framework and to payments made during the year. We also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 1969. Rogers, Arkansas March 17, 2023 52 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated March 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Rogers, Arkansas March 17, 2023 53 Walmart Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General Walmart Inc. (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to help people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers. The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023""), January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022"") and January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021""). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments in common stock or in-substance common stock for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2023 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $ 2.0 billion and $ 1.7 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $ 8.6 billion and $ 14.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, approximately 62 % and 50 % were held outside of the U.S., respectively. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations. The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $ 2.9 billion and $ 4.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws, other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders. Receivables Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which includes pharmacy insurance companies as well as advertisers, and banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, net receivables from transactions with customers were $ 3.7 billion and $ 3.4 billion, respectively. 59 Inventories The Company utilizes various inventory methods to account for and value its inventories depending upon the nature of the store formats and businesses in each of its segments, resulting in inventories that are recorded at the lower of cost or market or net realizable value, as appropriate. • Walmart U.S. Segment - Inventories are primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting (""RIM"") to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") valuation method. RIM generally results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market as permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. • Walmart International Segment – Depending on the store format in each market, inventories are generally accounted for using either the RIM or weighted-average cost method, using the first-in, first-out valuation method. • Sam's Club Segment - The majority of this segment's inventory is accounted for and valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. For those segments that utilize the LIFO method, the Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation. These estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end for inflation or deflation and inventory levels. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis: Estimated Useful Lives As of January 31, (Dollars in millions) (in Years) 2023 2022 Land N/A $ 19,317 $ 19,204 Buildings and improvements 3 - 40 104,554 100,376 Fixtures and equipment 2 - 30 65,235 60,282 Transportation equipment 3 - 15 2,462 2,263 Construction in progress N/A 10,802 7,199 Property and equipment 202,370 189,324 Accumulated depreciation ( 101,610 ) ( 94,809 ) Property and equipment, net $ 100,760 $ 94,515 Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and intangible assets for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 10.9 billion, $ 10.7 billion and $ 11.2 billion, respectively. Leases For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company records right-of-use (""ROU"") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. If the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not readily determinable, the Company's applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments. Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. 60 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. Goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2023, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. Management has performed its evaluation and determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill. The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2023 and 2022: (Amounts in millions) Walmart U.S. Walmart International Sam's Club Total Balances as of February 1, 2021 $ 2,696 $ 25,966 $ 321 $ 28,983 Changes in currency translation and other — ( 415 ) — ( 415 ) Acquisitions 245 201 — 446 Balances as of January 31, 2022 2,941 25,752 321 29,014 Changes in currency translation and other — ( 1,475 ) — ( 1,475 ) Acquisitions 433 202 — 635 Balances as of January 31, 2023 $ 3,374 $ 24,479 $ 321 $ 28,174 Intangible assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $ 4.3 billion and $ 4.8 billion, respectively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily consists of acquired trade names. There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021. Fair Value Measurement The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Refer to Note 8 for more information. Investments Investments in equity securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value of equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the fair value option measured on a recurring basis, are recognized within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value changes, along with certain other immaterial investment activity, resulted in net losses of $ 1.7 billion and $ 2.4 billion for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively and net gains of $ 8.6 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily due to net changes in the underlying stock prices of those investments. Refer to Note 8 for details. Equity investments without readily 61 determinable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments in debt securities classified as trading are reported at fair value and adjustments in fair value are recorded within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the Company had $ 0.5 billion and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, in debt securities classified as trading. Indemnification Liabilities The Company has provided certain indemnifications in connection with its divestitures and has recorded indemnification liabilities equal to the estimated fair value of the obligations upon inception. As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the Company had $ 0.6 billion and $ 0.7 billion, respectively, of certain legal indemnification liabilities recorded within deferred income taxes and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum of potential future payments under these indemnities was $ 3.1 billion, based on exchange rates as of January 31, 2023. Self Insurance Reserves The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits. Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability. Derivatives The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty. The Company enters into derivatives with counterparties rated generally ""A-"" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The Company is subject to master netting arrangements which provides set-off and close-out netting of exposures with counterparties, but the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's collateral arrangements require the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-determined thresholds, after considering the effects of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral. Cash collateral received from counterparties and cash collateral provided to counterparties under these arrangement s was not significant as of January 31, 2023 and 2022. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, derivative gains and losses are recorded through the same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings. Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 8 for the presentation of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities. Fair Value Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2023 to September 2031. Cash Flow Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The Company records changes in the fair value of these swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from July 2024 to January 2039. 62 Net Investment Hedges Prior to the divestiture of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan as discussed in Note 12 , the Company was a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with net investments of these foreign operations. Changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company also previously designated certain foreign currency denominated long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of these divested operations and recorded foreign currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss as discussed in Note 4 . Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (""temporary differences""). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates. In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interests that are redeemable outside the Company's control at fixed or determinable prices and dates are presented as temporary equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are recorded at the greater of the redemption fair value or the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and adjusted each reporting period for income, loss and any distributions made. Remeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are recognized in capital in excess of par. As of January 31, 2023, the Company has a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to an acquisition in the Walmart U.S. segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option which may require the Company to purchase its interest beginning in December 2027 with annual options thereafter. Revenue Recognition Net Sales The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or services to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns. Membership Fee Revenue The Company recognizes membership fee revenue over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $ 2.6 billion for fiscal 2023, $ 2.2 billion for fiscal 2022 and $ 1.7 billion for fiscal 2021. Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 63 Gift Cards Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period. Financial, Advertising and Other Services The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs. Payments from Suppliers The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, certain advertising arrangements and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold. Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of digital, television and print advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising costs were $ 4.1 billion, $ 3.9 billion and $ 3.2 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for investors and other allocators of capital. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to each period in which a balance sheet is presented, except for disclosure of rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures. 64 Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 11,292 $ 13,940 $ 13,706 Consolidated net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 388 ( 267 ) ( 196 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 11,680 $ 13,673 $ 13,510 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,724 2,792 2,831 Dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards 10 13 16 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,734 2,805 2,847 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 4.29 $ 4.90 $ 4.77 Diluted 4.27 4.87 4.75 Note 3. Shareholders' Equity The total authorized shares of $ 0.10 par value common stock is 11.0 billion, of which 2.7 billion and 2.8 billion were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Purchases and Sales of Subsidiary Stock During fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $ 0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's Massmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership in Massmart from approximately 53 % to 100 %. Additionally, the Company completed a $ 0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously consolidated as a variable interest entity, and resulted in the Company becoming a 100 % owner. Also during fiscal 2023, the Company increased its ownership in PhonePe, a digital transaction platform in India, from approximately 76 % to approximately 89 % as part of the separation from the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. In consideration for the transaction, the Company recorded a liability to noncontrolling interest holders of $ 0.9 billion within accrued liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. During fiscal 2022, the Company received $ 3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary, which reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 83 % as of January 31, 2021 to approximately 75 %. Share-Based Compensation The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $ 1.6 billion, $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.2 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $ 0.4 billion, $ 0.3 billion and $ 0.3 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type for all plans: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Restricted stock units $ 927 $ 659 $ 742 Restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units 444 321 277 Other 207 183 150 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,578 $ 1,163 $ 1,169 The Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the ""Plan""), as subsequently amended and restated, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other equity compensation 65 awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders. The Plan's award types are summarized as follows: • Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Beginning in fiscal 2023, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 8 % each quarter over a three year period from the date of grant. For grants made from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 25 % each year over a four year period from the date of the grant. Prior to fiscal 2020, 50 % of restricted stock units generally vested three years from the grant date and the remaining 50 % were vested five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 2.3 %, 3.8 % and 4.4 %, respectively. • Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance-based restricted stock units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and generally range from 0 % to 150 % of the original award amount. Vesting periods for restricted stock are generally between one month and three years . Vesting periods for performance-based restricted stock units are generally between one and three years . Restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 3.3 %, 4.2 % and 4.5 %, respectively. In addition to the Plan, Flipkart and PhonePe have share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to acquire their own common shares may be issued. These plans may be subject to performance or other conditions, including vesting upon an initial public offering. Share-based compensation expense associated with certain of these plans is included in the Other line in the table above. The following table shows the activity for restricted stock units and restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units during fiscal 2023: Restricted Stock Units Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (Shares in thousands) Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share Outstanding as of February 1, 2022 17,283 $ 111.42 6,140 $ 125.25 Granted 9,357 143.97 4,572 142.74 Adjustment for performance achievement (1) — — 638 132.00 Vested/exercised ( 8,338 ) 111.69 ( 3,242 ) 120.18 Forfeited ( 2,082 ) 127.36 ( 948 ) 128.68 Outstanding as of January 31, 2023 16,220 $ 128.01 7,160 $ 138.86 (1) Represents the adjustment to previously granted performance share units for performance achievement. The following table includes additional information related to restricted stock units and restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except years) 2023 2022 2021 Fair value of restricted stock units vested $ 931 $ 703 $ 597 Fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units vested 390 264 275 Unrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock units 1,323 1,102 1,062 Unrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units 548 417 344 Weighted average remaining period to expense for restricted stock units (years) 1.0 1.2 1.1 Weighted average remaining period to expense for restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units (years) 1.4 1.5 1.4 66 Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to November 21, 2022 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. In November 2022, the Company approved a new $ 20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning November 21, 2022, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of January 31, 2023 authorization for $ 19.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations and the market price of the Company's common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021 Total number of shares repurchased 73.9 69.7 19.4 Average price paid per share $ 134.17 $ 140.45 $ 135.20 Total cash paid for share repurchases $ 9,920 $ 9,787 $ 2,625 Note 4.

Refer to Note 12 . (2) Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss, the majority of which was considered in the impairment evaluation when the individual disposal groups met the held for sale classification in fiscal 2021. (3) Upon closing of the noncontrolling interest shareholder buyout of the Company's Massmart subsidiary during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the cumulative amount of currency translation was reallocated from the Company's noncontrolling interest back to the Company. Refer to Note 3 . Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for foreign currency on matured bonds (reflected in currency translation and other) and derivatives are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation resulting from the disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant. 67 Note 5.

Note 6. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt Short-term borrowings consist of commercial paper and lines of credit. Short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $ 0.4 billion, with weighted-average interest rates of 6.6 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. to support its commercial paper program and are summarized in the following table: January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 (Amounts in millions) Available Drawn Undrawn Available Drawn Undrawn Five -year credit facility (1) $ 5,000 $ — $ 5,000 $ 5,000 $ — $ 5,000 364 -day revolving credit facility (1) 10,000 — 10,000 10,000 — 10,000 Total $ 15,000 $ — $ 15,000 $ 15,000 $ — $ 15,000 (1) In April 2022, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364 -day revolving credit facility as well as its five year credit facility. The committed lines of credit in the table above mature in April 2023 and April 2027, carry interest rates of SOFR plus 60 basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between 1.5 and 4.0 basis points. In conjunction with the committed lines of credit listed in the table above, the Company has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt. Additionally, the Company has syndicated and fronted letters of credit available which totaled $ 2.1 billion and $ 1.8 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which $ 1.8 billion and $ 1.7 billion was drawn as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company's long-term debt, which includes the fair value instruments further discussed in Note 8 , consists of the following as of January 31, 2023 and 2022: January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 (Amounts in millions) Maturity Dates By Fiscal Year Amount Average Rate (1) Amount Average Rate (1) Unsecured debt Fixed 2024 - 2053 $ 33,707 3.6 % $ 29,957 3.5 % Total U.S. dollar denominated 33,707 29,957 Fixed 2027 - 2030 1,790 4.0 % 2,787 3.3 % Total Euro denominated 1,790 2,787 Fixed 2031 - 2039 3,318 5.4 % 3,601 5.4 % Total Sterling denominated 3,318 3,601 Fixed 2025 - 2028 767 0.4 % 1,475 0.3 % Total Yen denominated 767 1,475 Total unsecured debt 39,582 37,820 Total other (2) ( 742 ) ( 153 ) Total debt 38,840 37,667 Less amounts due within one year ( 4,191 ) ( 2,803 ) Long-term debt $ 34,649 $ 34,864 (1) The average rate represents the weighted-average stated rate for each corresponding debt category, based on year-end balances and year-end interest rates.

Leases The Company leases certain retail locations, distribution and fulfillment centers, warehouses, office spaces, land and equipment throughout the U.S. and internationally. The Company's lease costs recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income consist of the following: Fiscal years ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Operating lease cost $ 2,306 $ 2,274 $ 2,626 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets 596 565 583 Interest on lease obligations 256 232 298 Variable lease cost 899 823 777 70 Other lease information is as follows: Fiscal years ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Cash paid for amounts included in measurement of lease obligations: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 2,280 2,234 2,629 Operating cash flows from finance leases 248 225 286 Financing cash flows from finance leases 563 538 546 Assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations 1,714 1,816 2,131 Assets obtained in exchange for finance lease obligations 1,226 1,044 1,547 As of January 31, 2023 2022 Weighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases 12.0 years 12.2 years Weighted-average remaining lease term - finance leases 13.3 years 13.4 years Weighted-average discount rate - operating leases 6.0 % 5.9 % Weighted-average discount rate - finance leases 6.5 % 6.5 % The aggregate annual lease obligations at January 31, 2023, are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fiscal Year Operating Leases Finance Leases 2024 $ 2,166 $ 834 2025 2,077 774 2026 1,917 712 2027 1,735 638 2028 1,556 545 Thereafter 11,018 5,438 Total undiscounted lease obligations 20,469 8,941 Less imputed interest ( 6,168 ) ( 3,531 ) Net lease obligations $ 14,301 $ 5,410 Note 8. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. As described in Note 1 , the Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain equity method investments, on a recurring basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of the Company's equity investments measured on a recurring basis are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of January 31, 2023 Fair Value as of January 31, 2022 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 5,099 $ 6,069 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 5,570 5,819 Total $ 10,669 $ 11,888 71 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 8,021 $ ( 689 ) (1) $ 8,021 $ ( 47 ) (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 5,900 ( 1,423 ) (1) 7,855 ( 1,048 ) (1) Total $ 13,921 $ ( 2,112 ) $ 15,876 $ ( 1,095 ) (1) Primarily classified in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. Upon completing the sales of the Company's operations in the U.K. in February 2021 and Japan in March 2021, the Company recorded incremental non-recurring impairment charges of $ 0.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 12 . The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of January 31, 2023. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company's operations in Argentina, Japan and the U.K. met the held for sale criteria in fiscal 2021, as further discussed in Note 12 . As a result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, less costs to sell, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement based on each transaction's expected consideration. The carrying value of the Argentina, Japan and U.K. disposal groups exceeded their fair value, less costs to sell, and as a result, the Company recognized non-recurring impairment charges. The aggregate pre-tax loss of $ 8.3 billion associated with the divestiture of these operations in the Walmart International segment was recorded in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended January 31, 2021, and included these impairment charges as well as a $ 2.3 billion charge related to the Asda pension plan. These impairment charges included the anticipated release of non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses associated with the disposal groups. Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2021 were immaterial. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows: January 31, 2023 January 31, 2022 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 38,840 $ 38,169 $ 37,667 $ 42,381 Note 9. Taxes The components of income before income taxes are as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 U.S. $ 15,089 $ 15,536 $ 18,068 Non-U.S. 1,927 3,160 2,496 Total income before income taxes $ 17,016 $ 18,696 $ 20,564 72 A summary of the provision for income taxes is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Current: U.S. federal $ 2,030 $ 3,313 $ 2,991 U.S. state and local 610 649 742 International 2,654 1,553 1,127 Total current tax provision 5,294 5,515 4,860 Deferred: U.S. federal 608 ( 671 ) 2,316 U.S. state and local 119 41 23 International ( 297 ) ( 129 ) ( 341 ) Total deferred tax expense (benefit) 430 ( 759 ) 1,998 Total provision for income taxes $ 5,724 $ 4,756 $ 6,858 Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing operations is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2023 2022 2021 U.S. statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % U.S. state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 3.1 % 2.8 % 2.9 % Income taxed outside the U.S. 1.1 % ( 1.5 ) % ( 0.1 ) % Separation, disposal and wind-down of certain business operations 6.3 % 0.5 % 7.1 % Valuation allowance 1.7 % 4.4 % 2.3 % Net impact of repatriated international earnings ( 0.4 ) % ( 0.3 ) % ( 0.4 ) % Federal tax credits ( 1.3 ) % ( 1.1 ) % ( 0.9 ) % Change in unrecognized tax benefits 0.3 % 0.2 % 0.8 % Other, net 1.8 % ( 0.6 ) % 0.6 % Effective income tax rate 33.6 % 25.4 % 33.3 % The following sections regarding deferred taxes, unremitted earnings, net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards, valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions exclude amounts related to operations classified as held for sale. Deferred Taxes The significant components of the Company's deferred tax account balances are as follows: January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Deferred tax assets: Loss and tax credit carryforwards $ 7,690 $ 9,456 Accrued liabilities 3,312 2,752 Share-based compensation 237 231 Lease obligations 4,653 4,320 Other 839 893 Total deferred tax assets 16,731 17,652 Valuation allowances ( 7,815 ) ( 9,542 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 8,916 8,110 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment 4,352 4,414 Acquired intangibles 932 1,065 Inventory 3,032 1,588 Lease right of use assets 4,727 4,355 Mark-to-market investments 1,390 1,825 Other 249 307 Total deferred tax liabilities 14,682 13,554 Net deferred tax liabilities $ 5,766 $ 5,444 73 The deferred taxes noted above are classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Balance Sheet classification Assets: Other long-term assets $ 1,503 $ 1,473 Liabilities: Deferred income taxes and other 7,269 6,917 Net deferred tax liabilities $ 5,766 $ 5,444 Unremitted Earnings Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act""), the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings, and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. As of January 31, 2023, the Company has not recorded approximately $ 3 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation. Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances As of January 31, 2023, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $ 32.3 billion. Of these carryforwards, approximately $ 19.6 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2043. The remaining carryforwards have no expiration. The realizability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To the extent that a valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company had valuation allowances of approximately $ 7.8 billion and $ 9.5 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with the net operating loss carryforwards. Activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2023 related to valuation allowance builds in multiple markets, as well as releases due to the expiration of unrealized deferred tax assets. Uncertain Tax Positions The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $ 3.3 billion and $ 3.2 billion, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.8 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 3,245 $ 3,135 $ 1,817 Increases related to prior year tax positions 79 170 92 Decreases related to prior year tax positions ( 248 ) ( 97 ) ( 264 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 357 75 1,582 Settlements during the period ( 89 ) ( 5 ) ( 64 ) Lapse in statutes of limitations ( 37 ) ( 33 ) ( 28 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 3,307 $ 3,245 $ 3,135 The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. Interest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements. 74 The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2018 through 2022. The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2013 through 2022, and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2015 through 2022. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2013. Other Taxes The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments and judgments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 10. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. From time to time, the Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid Related Litigation During fiscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $ 3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework (described below) and other previously agreed upon state and tribal settlements. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. Moreover, the Settlement Framework will only take effect once a sufficient number of political subdivisions join, and there is no assurance regarding such participation. The amount of ultimate loss may thus differ materially from this accrual. The Settlement Framework includes no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company, and the Company continues to believe it has substantial factual and legal defenses to opioids-related litigation. In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL"") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in the MDL. Similar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state courts by state, local, and tribal governments, healthcare providers, and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these state court cases and in the MDL are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. On November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes whether as part of the MDL (excluding, however, a single, two-county trial described further below) or pending state court, as well as all potential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes for up to approximately $ 3.1 billion (the ""Settlement Amount""). The Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of alleged harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent settlements by the Company. One settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the states and political subdivisions, and another settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to collectively as the ""Settlement Framework."" The Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political subdivisions are contingent upon the number of states and political subdivisions, including those states and political subdivisions who have not yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline. On December 20, 2022, the Company announced that it had settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other 75 U.S. territories (the ""Settling States""), thus satisfying the initial threshold of required participation by Settling States. The settlement with the Settling States is now contingent upon, among other applicable terms and conditions, a sufficient number of political subdivisions also agreeing to participate in the Settlement Framework. If all conditions for the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, the minimum participation thresholds applicable for political subdivisions are satisfied within the prescribed deadlines, then the Company would expect to pay up to the full portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States, beginning as early as the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and being completed during fiscal 2024. However, the Company cannot predict if, when, or to what extent the Settlement Framework will be finalized with any of the Settling States. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company paid $ 0.4 billion for separate settlements with Cherokee Nation, New Mexico, and Florida. Following these payments, the remaining $ 2.9 billion liability for the Settlement Framework and other settlements is recorded in accrued liabilities within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2023. The Settlement Framework also provides for payments to Native American tribes (excluding Cherokee Nation), contingent upon the number of tribes, including those tribes that have not yet sued the Company, that agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline (the ""Settling Tribes""). Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Framework, on March 3, 2023, the Company paid approximately $ 0.1 billion to the Settling Tribes in satisfaction of their claims against the Company. Other Opioid Related Litigation The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related litigation not covered or otherwise extinguished by the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any other actions filed by healthcare providers, individuals, and third-party payers, as well as any action filed by a state, political subdivision, or Native American tribe that does not agree to the Settlement Framework. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a liability for these opioid-related litigation matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of any of these matters and no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Two-county Trial and MDL Bellwethers. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $ 0.7 billion over fifteen years , on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the Company filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. The MDL has designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however, these five counties ultimately may elect to participate in the Settlement Framework and receive a portion of the Settlement Amount rather than go to trial. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. Opioid Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties had fully briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9, 2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which was filed on October 14, 2022 and which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other opioids litigation matters. On September 27, 2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the 76 current Board and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business. The defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. On September 26, 2022, the court held a hearing on that motion, and a ruling remains pending. Other Legal Proceedings Asda Equal Value Claims. Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, as well as additional claims in the High Court of the United Kingdom (the ""Asda Equal Value Claims""). Further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to certain of these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters. Money Transfer Agent Services Matters. The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") seeking documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company continues to cooperate with and provide information in response to requests from the DOJ. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the ""FTC"") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Walmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer agent services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, on October 5, 2022, the FTC responded to the motion, and on October 28, 2022, the Company filed its reply. The court has entered an order staying discovery pending a decision on the Company's motion to dismiss. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Note 11. Retirement-Related Benefits The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches 100 % of participant contributions up to 6 % of annual eligible earnings. The matching contributions immediately vest at 100 % for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50 % of their pre-tax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits. Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established. The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Defined contribution plans: U.S. $ 1,491 $ 1,441 $ 1,290 International 74 39 200 Total contribution expense for defined contribution plans $ 1,565 $ 1,480 $ 1,490 Additionally, the Company's previously owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom sponsored a defined benefit pension plan. In fiscal 2020, Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the ""Plan"") entered into an agreement pursuant to which Asda made a cash contribution of $ 1.0 billion to the Plan (the ""Asda Pension Contribution"") which enabled the Plan to purchase a bulk annuity insurance contract for the benefit of Plan participants, and released the Plan and Asda from any future obligations. In connection with the sale of Asda, all accumulated pension components of $ 2.3 billion were included in the disposal group and the estimated pre-tax loss recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as discussed in Note 8 and Note 12 . 77 Note 12. Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items The following dispositions impact the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred. Asda In February 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Asda, the Company's retail operations in the U.K., for net consideration of $ 9.6 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $ 0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Asda and recognized its retained investment in Asda as a debt security within other long-term assets and also recognized certain legal and tax indemnity liabilities within deferred income taxes and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Asda was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $ 5.5 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Upon classifying the Asda disposal group as held for sale, $ 2.3 billion of accumulated pension components associated with the expected derecognition of the Asda pension plan were included as part of the loss. In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by approximately $ 0.8 billion related to the estimated fair value of certain indemnities and other transaction related costs. Seiyu In March 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Seiyu, the Company's retail operations in Japan, for net consideration of $ 1.2 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $ 0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Seiyu and recognized its retained 15 percent ownership interest in Seiyu as an equity investment within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Seiyu was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $ 1.9 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Walmart Argentina In November 2020, the Company completed the sale of Walmart Argentina. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $ 1.0 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income primarily due to the impact of cumulative translation losses on the carrying value of the disposal group. Note 13. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of recent divestitures. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly 78 reviewed by its CODM. Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in the following table: (Amounts in millions) Walmart U.S. Walmart International Sam's Club Corporate and support Consolidated Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 Net sales $ 420,553 $ 100,983 $ 84,345 $ — $ 605,881 Operating income (loss) 20,620 2,965 1,964 ( 5,121 ) 20,428 Interest, net ( 1,874 ) Other gains and (losses) ( 1,538 ) Income before income taxes $ 17,016 Total assets $ 130,659 $ 86,766 $ 15,490 $ 10,282 $ 243,197 Depreciation and amortization 7,054 1,964 609 1,318 10,945 Capital expenditures 11,425 2,625 727 2,080 16,857 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022 Net sales $ 393,247 $ 100,959 $ 73,556 $ — $ 567,762 Operating income (loss) 21,587 3,758 2,259 ( 1,662 ) 25,942 Interest, net ( 1,836 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt ( 2,410 ) Other gains and (losses) ( 3,000 ) Income before income taxes $ 18,696 Total assets $ 125,044 $ 91,403 $ 14,678 $ 13,735 $ 244,860 Depreciation and amortization $ 6,773 $ 1,963 $ 601 $ 1,321 10,658 Capital expenditures $ 8,475 $ 2,497 $ 622 $ 1,512 13,106 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021 Net sales $ 369,963 $ 121,360 $ 63,910 $ — $ 555,233 Operating income (loss) 19,116 3,660 1,906 ( 2,134 ) 22,548 Interest, net ( 2,194 ) Other gains and (losses) 210 Income before income taxes $ 20,564 Total assets $ 113,490 $ 109,445 $ 13,415 $ 16,146 $ 252,496 Depreciation and amortization 6,561 2,633 599 1,359 11,152 Capital expenditures 6,131 2,436 488 1,209 10,264 Total revenues, consisting of net sales and membership and other income, and long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, net and lease right-of-use assets, aggregated by the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. operations for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, are as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Revenues U.S. operations $ 508,685 $ 470,295 $ 436,649 Non-U.S. operations 102,604 102,459 122,502 Total revenues $ 611,289 $ 572,754 $ 559,151 Long-lived assets U.S. operations $ 95,567 $ 89,795 $ 87,068 Non-U.S. operations 23,667 22,829 22,780 Total long-lived assets $ 119,234 $ 112,624 $ 109,848 No individual country outside of the U.S. had total revenues or long-lived assets that were material to the consolidated totals. Long-lived assets related to operations classified as held for sale are excluded from the table above. Additionally, the Company did not generate material revenues from any single customer. 79 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or market. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (""COSO"") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2023. The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report which appears herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we will begin upgrading our financial system, including our general ledger and other applications, in stages. This financial system will continue to be a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting as it is implemented. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION None. ITEM 9C.

Nature of Forward-Looking Statements Such forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead express our estimates or expectations for our consolidated, or one of our segment's, economic performance or results of operations for future periods or as of future dates or events or developments that may occur in the future or discuss our plans, objectives or goals. These forward-looking statements may relate to: • the growth of our business or change in our competitive position in the future or in or over particular periods; • the amount, number, growth, increase, reduction or decrease in or over certain periods, of or in certain financial items or measures or operating measures, including our earnings per share, net sales, comparable store and club sales, our Walmart U.S. operating segment's eCommerce sales, liabilities, expenses of certain categories, expense leverage, operating income, returns, capital and operating investments or expenditures of particular types and new store openings; • investments and capital expenditures we will make and how certain of those investments and capital expenditures are expected to be financed; • our increasing investments in eCommerce, technology, supply chain, store remodels and other omni-channel customer initiatives, such as same day pickup and delivery; • our workforce strategy; • volatility in currency exchange rates affecting our or one of our segments' results of operations; • the Company continuing to provide returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, the use of share repurchase authorization over a certain period or the source of funding of a certain portion of our share repurchases; • our sources of liquidity, including our cash, continuing to be adequate or sufficient to fund our operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund share repurchases; • cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs; • the reclassification of amounts related to our derivatives; • our effective tax rate for certain periods and the realization of certain net deferred tax assets and the effects of resolutions of tax-related matters; • the effect of adverse decisions in, or settlement of, litigation or other proceedings or investigations to which we are subject; • the effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position of the Company's adoption of certain new, or amendments to existing, accounting standards; or • our commitments, intentions, plans or goals related to environmental, sustainability, and governance (""ESG"") priorities, including, but not limited to, the sustainability of our environment and supply chains, the promotion of economic opportunity or other societal initiatives. Our forward-looking statements may also include statements of our strategies, plans and objectives for our operations, including areas of future focus in our operations, and the assumptions underlying any of the forward-looking statements we make.

Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022""), January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021"") and January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020""). During fiscal 2022, we generated total revenues of $572.8 billion, which was comprised primarily of net sales of $567.8 billion. We maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""WMT."" The Development of Our Company The businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2022, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 23 countries. In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have over 8,000 pickup and 6,000 delivery locations globally. In recent years, we have heavily invested in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, as well as made several eCommerce acquisitions to better serve our customers. These investments have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, incubate digitally-native brands, and expand our assortment and service offerings. We have also continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives internationally, such as with our acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart""), which is our ecosystem in India that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform. We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, service offerings, eCommerce websites and marketplaces as well as our supply chain combined with approximately 2.3 million associates as of January 31, 2022 to better serve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates relationships where customers view Walmart as their primary destination. In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. As we execute on our strategy, our flywheel is accelerating through offerings such as our Walmart Connect advertising business, Walmart Fulfillment Services, our health and wellness business, including Walmart Health, and our financial services business. These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our flywheel centered around our customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience. 6 Information About Our Segments We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. We also previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these divestitures. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club, which are further described below. Each segment contributes to the Company's operating results differently. However, each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic information is contained in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Walmart U.S. Segment Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the ""Walmart"" and ""Walmart Neighborhood Market"" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $393.2 billion for fiscal 2022, representing 69% of our fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $370.0 billion and $341.0 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate""). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. Omni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, through services such as pickup and delivery, ship-from-store, and digital pharmacy fulfillment options. As of January 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,600 pickup locations and more than 3,500 same-day delivery locations. Our Walmart+ membership offering provides enhanced omni-channel shopping benefits that currently include unlimited free shipping on eligible items with no order minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel and pharmacy discounts, and mobile scan & go for a streamlined in-store shopping experience. We have several eCommerce websites, the largest of which is walmart.com. We define eCommerce sales as sales initiated by customers digitally and fulfilled by a number of methods including our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and leveraging our stores. The following table provides the approximate size of our retail stores as of January 31, 2022: Minimum Square Feet Maximum Square Feet Average Square Feet Supercenters (general merchandise and grocery) 69,000 260,000 178,000 Discount stores (general merchandise and limited grocery) 30,000 221,000 105,000 Neighborhood markets (1) (grocery) 28,000 65,000 42,000 (1) Excludes other small formats. Merchandise. Walmart U.S. does business in three strategic merchandise units, listed below: • Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat, produce, deli & bakery, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, pet supplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products; • General merchandise includes: ◦ Entertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music and books); ◦ Hardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery); ◦ Apparel (e.g., apparel for men, women, girls, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and ◦ Home (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed & bath, furniture and home organization, home furnishings, home decor, fabrics and crafts). • Health and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical services and other clinical services. Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: ""Allswell,"" ""Athletic Works,"" ""Bonobos Fielder,"" ""Eloquii Elements,"" ""Equate,"" ""Free Assembly,"" ""Freshness Guaranteed,"" ""George,"" ""Great Value,"" ""Holiday Time,"" ""Hyper Tough,"" ""Mainstays,"" ""Marketside,"" ""No Boundaries,"" ""onn.,"" ""Ozark Trail,"" ""Parent's Choice,"" ""Sam's Choice,"" ""Scoop,"" ""Spring Valley,"" ""Time and Tru,"" ""Way to Celebrate"" and ""Wonder Nation."" The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: ""Avia,"" ""Better Homes & Gardens,"" ""Pioneer Woman"" and ""Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara."" 7 Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability. The Walmart U.S. business also includes an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, and access to quality, affordable healthcare via Walmart Health. In Fiscal 2022, Walmart U.S. initiatives also included the launch of a B2B last mile delivery service platform via Walmart GoLocal, and Walmart Luminate which provides a suite of data products to merchants and suppliers. Additional service offerings include fuel, financial services and related products (including through our digital channels, stores and clubs as well as our previously announced fintech joint venture), such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment, and certain types of installment lending. Combined, these offerings do not currently represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues. Operations. Walmart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets, as well as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, Walmart+, ship-from-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, eCommerce retailers, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These strategies include the following: • EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity; • EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; • Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and • Expanding our flywheel and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services. Distribution. We utilize a total of 157 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2022, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 31 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more than 3,500 stores. Walmart International Segment Walmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 23 countries outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2022. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, and China, and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Walmart International previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of 8 Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent divestitures. Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $101.0 billion for fiscal 2022, representing 18% of our fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $121.4 billion and $120.1 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its format mix. Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years: • Divestiture of Walmart Argentina in November 2020. • Divestiture of Asda Group Limited (""Asda""), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021. • Divestiture of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021. Omni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, our marketplaces such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India. Same-day delivery capacity continues to expand in Mexico, including our recent launch of a membership model which provides unlimited same-day delivery from stores, and in China, our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia provide customers one-hour delivery by leveraging Walmart stores as fulfillment centers. A value-based internet and telephone service was recently launched in Mexico allowing customers to enjoy digital connectivity. Generally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 24,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2022, Walmart International had approximately 2,900 pickup and over 1,900 delivery locations. Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as ""Equate,"" ""George,"" ""Great Value,"" ""Holiday Time,"" ""Mainstays,"" ""Marketside"" and ""Parent's Choice,"" our international markets have developed market specific brands including ""Aurrera,"" ""Cambridge,"" ""Extra Special,"" ""Lider,"" ""Myntra,"" and ""PhonePe."" In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices. Walmart International also offers advertising, financial services and related products in various markets. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India provides a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising. Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help its various formats operate more efficiently, as well as to provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Competition. Walmart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories 9 in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us. Distribution. We utilize a total of 179 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mexico and South Africa. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2022, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and distribution and fulfillment centers which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 83 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, more than 3,400 eCommerce sort centers and last-mile delivery facilities in India, as well as our physical retail stores. Sam's Club Segment Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club had net sales of $73.6 billion for fiscal 2022, representing 13% of our consolidated fiscal 2022 net sales, and had net sales of $63.9 billion and $58.8 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. Membership. The following two options are available to members: Plus Membership Club Membership Annual Membership Fee $100 $45 Number of Add-on Memberships ($40 each) Up to 16 Up to 8 All memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost. Plus Members are also eligible for free shipping on the majority of merchandise, with no minimum order size, and receive discounts on prescriptions and glasses. Beginning in fiscal 2023, Sam's Club launched a single loyalty rewards currency called Sam's Cash which merges and replaces existing Cash Rewards for Plus members and Cash Back for Sam's Club Mastercard holders. Members may redeem Sam's Cash on purchases in the club and online, to pay for membership fees or for cash in clubs. Sam's Cash does not expire and is available for monthly redemption. Omni-channel. Sam's Club provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce through such services as Curbside Pickup, mobile Scan & Go, ship-from-club, and delivery-from-club. Members have access to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, including those not found in our clubs, online at samsclub.com and through our mobile commerce applications. The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 32,000 and 168,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet. Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories: • Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items; • Fuel, tobacco and other categories; • Home and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, tools and power equipment, housewares, toys, seasonal items, mattresses, and tire and battery centers; • Technology, office and entertainment includes consumer electronics and accessories, software, video games, office supplies, appliances, and third-party gift cards; and • Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services and over-the-counter drugs. In addition, the Member's Mark private label brand continues to expand its assortment and deliver member value. Operations. Operating hours for Sam's Clubs are generally Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, most club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 8:00 a.m. Consistent with its strategy, Sam's Club continues to develop technology tools to drive a great member experience. Curbside Pickup is available at all clubs to help provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members. Sam's Club also offers ""Scan & Go,"" a mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line. 10 Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete. Distribution. We utilize 28 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., as well as some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. During fiscal 2022, the majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were shipped directly to Sam's Club locations by suppliers. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs, 12 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers. Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties. Suppliers and Supply Chain As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the ""fresh"" category. We offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access for example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members. Government Regulation As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in "" Item 1A. Risk Factors "" under the sub-caption ""Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks."" Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") Priorities Our ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long-term value and create competitive advantage for the Company by serving our stakeholders, including our customers, associates, shareholders, suppliers, business partners, and communities. We believe that addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business, including by enhancing customer and associate trust, creating new revenue streams, managing cost and risk, building capabilities for future advantage, and strengthening the underlying systems we all rely on. We prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value: issues that rank high in relevance to our business and stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned to make a positive impact. Our current ESG priorities are categorized into four broad themes: opportunity, sustainability, community, and ethics and integrity. 11 • Opportunity . Retail can be a powerful engine for inclusive economic opportunity. We aim to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion, and to provide opportunity for Walmart associates (as further described in the Human Capital Management section below), our supply chain and the communities we're in to fulfill our customer mission, strengthen our business and help people build a better life for themselves and their families. • Sustainability . Walmart's sustainability efforts focus on our ability to create and preserve long-term value for both people and planet. With respect to people, our sustainability efforts focus on sourcing responsibly, helping prevent forced labor, empowering women, creating inclusive economic opportunity and selling safer, healthier products. With respect to the planet, our efforts aim to enhance the sustainability of product supply chains by reducing emissions, protecting and restoring nature, and reducing waste. To help address the effects of climate change, Walmart has set science-based targets for emissions reduction, including our goal to achieve zero emissions in our operations by 2040—without offsets—and to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of emissions in our value chain by 2030 under our Project Gigaton™ initiative. • Community . Walmart aims to serve and strengthen communities by operating our business in a way that meets the needs of our customer and community stakeholder groups, including by providing safer, healthier and more affordable food and other products, disaster support, associate volunteerism, local grant programs and community cohesion initiatives. • Ethics and Integrity . At every level of our Company, we work to create a culture that inspires trust among our associates, with our customers, and in the communities we serve . We periodically publish information on our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and may update those disclosures from time to time. Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting, documents or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Human Capital Management Our commitment to help people around the world save money and live better is delivered by our associates who make the difference for our customers every day. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we employed approximately 2.3 million associates worldwide, with approximately 1.7 million associates in the U.S. and approximately 0.6 million associates internationally. In the U.S., approximately 94% of these associates are hourly and approximately 69% are full-time. We believe the strength of our workforce, our associates, is a significant contributor to our success. Walmart is a place of opportunity, not only as a foundational entry point to develop critical skills that are relevant for a variety of careers, but also a place where people can grow in their careers across our global omni-channel business. As customer expectations and technology change the nature of work, we are focused on attracting, developing, rewarding, and retaining associates to thrive in an ever-changing environment. Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers in hourly positions. Our focus on providing a path of career opportunity for our associates through robust training, competitive wages and benefits, and opportunities for advancement creates a strong associate value proposition. The COVID-19 pandemic and the related reassessment taking place across the workforce had an impact on our retention of associates and as a result turnover in the U.S. increased compared to the previous fiscal year. Our workforce strategy includes the following strategic priorities: Inclusion - Build a Walmart for everyone: a diverse, equitable and inclusive company, where associates' ideas and opinions matter . We are focused on creating an inclusive culture and a diverse associate base. Creating an environment where all associates believe they belong and are empowered to be themselves, which we believe is essential in serving our customers now and in the future. We publish our diversity representation twice yearly, and hold ourselves accountable to providing recurring culture, diversity, equity, and inclusion updates to senior leadership, including our President and CEO, and members of the Board of Directors. Of the approximately 2.3 million associates employed worldwide, 53% identify as women. In the U.S., 49% of the approximately 1.7 million associates identify as people of color. We review our processes regarding our commitment to fair-pay practices. We are committed to creating a performance culture where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance, and the work they do. To build a company where associates feel engaged, valued and heard, we gather and respond to associates' feedback in a variety of ways, including but not limited to an anonymous, periodic associate engagement survey, our Open Door process, and one-on-one interactions. Management reviews the results of feedback obtained from our formal associate engagement survey. Feedback and suggestions received through these channels have led to meaningful changes in our business. Well-being - Focus on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our associates. We invest in our associates by offering competitive wages, as well as a broad range of benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements, and we believe these investments in our associates are important to our future. In the U.S., we offer affordable healthcare coverage to our full-time and eligible part-time associates as well as company paid benefits such as 401(k) match, 12 maternity leave, a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates, paid time off, Associate Stock Purchase Plan match, life insurance, behavioral health services, and a store discount card or Sam's Club membership. Additional information about how we invest in our associates' well-being, including wage structure and pay, can be found in our Human Capital brief in our most recent ESG reporting, which is available on our corporate website. Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting documents, or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The health and safety of our associates remain our biggest priorities and we continue to focus on enabling access to vaccines, providing safeguards within facilities, and supporting associates. We encourage all associates to consider the COVID-19 vaccine and provide access to make the decision easier. Associates can become vaccinated while on the clock or receive paid time off to do so. Our COVID-leave policy, which was implemented in March 2020 to support associates during the pandemic, has been extended through March 31, 2022. Growth - Provide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue to attract talent with new skills. We are invested in the growth of our associates in support of our business and their success.

RISK FACTORS The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face. Strategic Risks Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance. The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate. Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, supply chain automation, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and interconnected ecosystem for our customers that deepens our relationships with our customers across our various businesses and partnerships and reinforces our overall flywheel strategy. The success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A . With the interconnected components of this flywheel strategy and an increasing allocation of capital expenditures focused on these initiatives, our failure to successfully execute on individual components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance. Furthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, automation, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term. If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and services and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those related to ESG issues) and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns 15 could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business. We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers, and other businesses which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. The omni-channel retail landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded competitors may increase competitive pressures. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets in which we operate, omni-channel innovations and omni-channel ecosystems developed by our competitors or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See "" Item 1. Business "" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments. Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to bankruptcy, consolidation or other factors. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-channel ecosystems, or reductions in operations may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our financial performance. General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets. In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our business. These arrangements may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could 16 have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, business relationship or in certain of our recently divested markets, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Operational Risks The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial position and results of operations continues to be unpredictable, and we may be unable to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and volatile in light of the potential for a resurgence of infection rates or as a result of future mutations, variants, or related strains of the virus. Recent years have demonstrated the widespread and varying impacts of the pandemic on certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus (such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions on retailers), our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. Customer behaviors have changed rapidly during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a resurgence of infections or future mutations, variants or related strains of the virus become prevalent, customer demand for certain products may fluctuate and customer behaviors may change, which may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors may result in higher out-of-stock positions in certain products, as well as delays in delivering those products, and could impact inventory levels in the future. Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we and our suppliers operate; further increased operational costs associated with operating during a global pandemic; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatments for COVID-19 or other variants; the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors. These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased revenue growth relative to historic trends, and has particularly accelerated our eCommerce growth. These results, as well as those of other metrics such as net income and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for future periods. Once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, particularly as vaccines become more widely available, and customers return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to the aforementioned containment directives and similar mandates, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities may result in declining revenue and future operating results may fall below expectations. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global economy, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements. Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, global health epidemics or pandemics and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical events; global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), in countries in which we operate, in which our suppliers are located, or in other areas of the world (such as in Ukraine where armed hostilities currently exist between Ukraine and Russia) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of either reduced availability 17 or economic sanctions, increased transportation costs (whether due to fuel prices, fuel supply, or otherwise), the disruption (whether directly or indirectly) of critical infrastructure systems, banking systems, utility services or energy availability to our stores, clubs and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores, clubs and our other facilities. Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions, drought, or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs, and distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; and heat and extreme weather events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which Walmart operates. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs. We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to these marketplace transactions apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law or the proprietary rights of others. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and flywheel strategy. 18 We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations. Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security incidents and breaches (through cyberattacks, which may be from cybercriminals or sophisticated state-sponsored threat actors), catastrophic events such as fires, major or extended winter storms, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by our associates or contractors, civil or political unrest, or armed hostilities. Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. Our information systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, breached, attacked, or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we frequently update our information technology hardware, software, processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media, online advertising, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and shipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' information including payment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A . Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse and/or loss, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity, and our ability to efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business. Any failure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cyberattacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Like most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store information concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with the digital platforms that we use to conduct and facilitate our various businesses. In addition, we and our third-party service providers store and maintain health-related personal information, pharmacy, and medical records in connection with our health and wellness and pharmacy business. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or 19 vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent. Attacks against information systems and devices, whether our own or those of our third-party service providers, create risk of cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware, malware, phishing incidents. We expect to continue to experience such attempted attacks in the future. Cyberattacks and threat actors can be sponsored by particular countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, phishing incidents, worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and disruptions. Mitigation and remediation recommendations continue to evolve, and addressing vulnerabilities is a priority for us. The increased use of remote work infrastructure due to the COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Some of our systems and third-party service providers' systems have experienced security incidents or breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a compromise or breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. Any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions (including, with respect to health information, liability under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or ""HIPAA""), customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security event, breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. Our compliance programs, information technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk. Disruptions in our systems caused by security incidents, breaches or cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do business with (such as strategic partners, suppliers, banks, or utility companies) – could harm our ability to conduct our operations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our partners, third-party service providers, customers, financial services firms, and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis. In addition, such security-related events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial position and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security compromise or ransomware event could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security incidents, breaches, or other compromises from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be developed in the future. In certain circumstances, our contracts with 20 payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. Additionally, through various financial service partners, we offer money transfers, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders, check cashing, prepaid access, co-branded credits cards, installment lending, and earned wage access. These products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation. The Company also has compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and transfer of personal information, which include liability for security and privacy breaches. Among other obligations, breaches may trigger obligations under federal and state laws to notify affected individuals, government agencies and the media. Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subject us to fines, sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation. Changes in the results of our health and wellness business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, as well as the recent addition of Walmart Health locations in a number of states which offer medical, dental, optometry, immunizations, and other health services. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (""PBMs""). These operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options with or without home delivery options; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use of third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and any additional changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business. If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies. One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while 21 controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Financial Risks Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, capital expenditures, comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts or, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations. Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations. We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations. Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance. In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. During fiscal 2022, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), antitrust and competition law regulatory matters (such as the competition investigations currently 22 underway in Mexico related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico, in Canada related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart Canada and competition proceedings in India related to our Flipkart subsidiary), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and regulations of other countries. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance. In fiscal 2022, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 82% of our consolidated net sales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business. We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles. We are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, any of which can impact our current and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act"") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any other new tax rules, regulations, guidance, and interpretations, including collecting information not regularly produced by the Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations. In addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes. The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate. Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial 23 Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made. Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws, regulations, and interpretations of such laws and regulations specific to the businesses and jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance. We operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Our operations in the U.S. are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements and reimbursement arrangements affecting our health and wellness operations. The laws and regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Affordable Care Act; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the ""FDA"") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the ""DEA""); trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer (including through our digital channels and stores and clubs as well as our previously announced fintech joint venture); anti-kickback laws; anti-money laundering laws; consumer financial protection laws; the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; false claims laws; patient inducement regulations; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse, quality and standards of medical equipment, and the qualifications and practice of the professions of medical, pharmacy, optical care and health care services. For example, in the U.S., the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the purchase, distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. In addition, other health-related legislation at the federal and state level may have an adverse effect on our business or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations. Also, upon the successful completion of the previously announced pending acquisitions by our fintech joint venture, there may be an increased degree of scrutiny by financial regulatory authorities over the newly acquired fintech related businesses, which may result in higher operational costs and an increased possibility for fines and penalties if there is non-compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S. Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence, and disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability (including with respect to our supply chain), natural resources, waste reduction, energy, human capital, and risk oversight could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protections laws and U.S. sanctions. We are also subject to data privacy and protection laws regulating the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA""), which was significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (""CPRA""), new comprehensive privacy legislation passed in 2021 in Virginia and Colorado, as well as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"") and China's Personal Information Protection Act. The potential effects of these laws are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. In the case of non-compliance with a material provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover in the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach. Residents in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws have expanded rights to access, correct and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Furthermore, our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer 24 Protection Act. We may be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including changing some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. If we fail to respond adequately to changes, including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives, or do not respond as effectively as our competitors, our business, operations, and financial performance may be adversely affected. While we strive to adhere our practices and procedures to these laws, they are subject to evolving regulations, interpretations, enforcement priorities of regulatory authorities, and regulator discretion. The regulatory, political, and media scrutiny we face, which may continue, amplifies these risks. We may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; loss of licenses; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug suppliers and third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or criminal and civil penalties. Failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and results of operations. We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental authorities. We may also have indemnification obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collective-action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids, including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA""). The Company's action was dismissed. The Company appealed this decision to the Fifth Circuit. On December 22, 2021, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the action. On December 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies in violation of the CSA. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. Since that time, the District Court stayed further proceedings in the DOJ complaint pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in two other cases interpreting the CSA, which have been consolidated into Ruan v. United States , 142 S. Ct. 457 (2021). In addition, the Company is the subject of a consolidated securities class action alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021 the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021; the lead plaintiff responded to the motion on January 10, 2022; and the defendants filed their reply brief on February 10, 2022. 25 Two derivative actions were also filed by certain of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of the Company's current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids, and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other Opioids litigation matters. Other shareholders filed a third derivative action making similar allegations in the Delaware Court of Chancery on September 27, 2021. The defendants in this derivative suit filed the opening brief on their motion to dismiss that case on December 21, 2021; and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters. We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption "" Item 3. Legal Proceedings "" and in Note 10 in the "" Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements ,"" which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our shareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. The exclusive forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under, the federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we are not able to achieve our ESG goals. We strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make significant progress in certain ESG priority issue areas. From time to time, we announce certain aspirations and goals relevant to our priority ESG issues. We periodically publish information about our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and update our ESG reporting from time to time. Achievement of these aspirations and goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in the achievement of our ESG goals or certain of our customers, associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations might not be satisfied with our efforts. Certain challenges we face in the achievement of our ESG objectives are also captured within our ESG reporting, which is not incorporated by reference into and does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A failure or perceived failure to meet our goals could adversely affect public perception of our business, associate morale or customer or shareholder support. ITEM 1B.

The land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the Company. We use independent contractors to construct our buildings. All store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based on sales volume. Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some of which include rent escalation clauses. For further information on our distribution centers, see the caption ""Distribution"" provided for each of our segments under "" Item 1. Business ."" 29 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in "" Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ,"" which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings."" We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,150 cases as of March 4, 2022. The liability phase of a trial in one of the MDL cases began on October 4, 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims. On November 23, 2021, the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the trial, which will determine amounts owed by the defendants, is currently scheduled to begin on May 10, 2022. The Company intends to appeal the jury verdict from the liability phase upon completion of the abatement phase of the trial. There is one case in which the Company is named as a defendant that was remanded from the MDL court to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma ( The Cherokee Nation v. CVS Pharmacy, Inc., et al. , Case No. CIV-18-56-RAW-SPS (E.D. Okla.)). This case was brought by the Cherokee Nation. Certain motions have been filed by the parties to this case, and the case is currently stayed pending a ruling on those motions. In addition, there are over 225 state court cases pending as of March 4, 2022, some of which may be removed to federal court to seek MDL transfer. The case citations for the state cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA"") . The Company's action, Walmart Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice et al., USDC, Eastern Dist. of Texas, 10/22/20, was dismissed. The Company had appealed this decision to the Fifth Circuit. On December 22, 2021, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the action. A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the DOJ against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the CSA related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al ., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. The DOJ filed its opposition brief on April 23, 2021 and the Company filed its reply brief on May 24, 2021. On November 19, 2021, the District Court stayed further proceedings in the DOJ complaint pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in two other cases interpreting the CSA, which have been consolidated into Ruan v. United States , 142 S. Ct. 457 (2021). Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation : Three derivative complaints and two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other Opioids litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in the Chancery Court in Delaware. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, were purportedly filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021; the lead plaintiff responded to the motion on January 10, 2022; and the defendants filed their reply brief on February 10, 2022. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in Delaware Chancery Court filed the opening brief on their motion to dismiss that case on December 21, 2021; and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v. McMillon et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 4/16/21: Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund et al. v. Walton et al., DE Court of Chancery, 9/27/21. Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and Martin v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC , Dist. of DE, 3/5/21, consolidated into In re Walmart Inc. Securities Litigation , USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21. 30 II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS: Asda Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal). Money Transfer Agent Services Proceedings: The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas and is cooperating with the government's investigation. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the ""FTC"") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. While the Company had been engaged in discussions with the FTC regarding a potential resolution of this matter, the parties have not been able to reach a resolution. In November 2021, the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection forwarded a draft civil complaint to the FTC seeking authority to file a complaint against the Company seeking various forms of monetary and injunctive relief. The FTC is currently considering whether to grant such authorization. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigations or any related actions by the governmental entities regarding these matters at this time. While the Company does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (""Flipkart""), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the ""Rules"") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, or whether the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million. In June 2021, the Company signed a tolling agreement with the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California to toll the statute of limitations for potential claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The Company believes the suit is without merit and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.

All repurchases made prior to February 22, 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of January 31, 2022, authorization for $10.6 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. 32 Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase programs, on a trade date basis, for each month in the quarter ended January 31, 2022, was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Repurchased Average Price Paid per Share (in dollars) Total Number of Shares Repurchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Repurchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (in billions) November 1-30, 2021 4,709,717 $ 146.42 4,709,717 $ 12.4 December 1-31, 2021 7,170,376 140.09 7,170,376 11.4 January 1-31, 2022 5,284,996 141.50 5,284,996 10.6 Total 17,165,089 17,165,089 (1) Represents the approximate dollar value of shares that could have been repurchased at the end of the month. ITEM 6. RESERVED 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022""), January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021"") and January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020""), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial position and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. We have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including the following highlights over the last three years: • In November 2020, we completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and recorded a pre-tax non-cash loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.0 billion, primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation losses. Refer to Note 12 . • In February 2021, we completed the sale of Asda for net consideration of $9.6 billion, for which we recognized an estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $5.5 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction. Refer to Note 11 and Note 12 . • In March 2021, we completed the sale of Seiyu for net consideration of $1.2 billion, for which we recognized an estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.9 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction. Refer to Note 12 . We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services, advertising, and data service businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates. We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, supply chain disruptions, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, 34 general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under "" Item 1A. Risk Factors ."" We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the duration and extent of economic stimulus measures; effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatment; supply chain disruptions; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Ope rations "" below. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expanding omni-channel initiatives that complement our flywheel strategy while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. Calendar comparable sales, including the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2022 and 2021, were as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 6.4% 8.7% 0.3% (0.2)% Sam's Club 15.0% 8.7% 5.5% (3.4)% Total U.S. 7.7% 8.7% 1.2% (0.6)% Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 7.7% and 8.7% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. comparable sales increased 6.4% and 8.7% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. For fiscal 2022, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which includes strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, average ticket increased while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips and purchased larger baskets. Transaction growth turned positive in April 2021 and continued with strong growth through the rest of the year as customers' pre-pandemic behaviors largely resumed. For fiscal 2021, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from meeting the increased demand due to economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% and 5.4% to comparable sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. Sam's Club comparable sales increased 15.0% and 8.7% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. For fiscal 2022, Sam's Club comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and was aided by consumer spending due to government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club comparable sales for fiscal 2021 benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% and 2.2% to comparable sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. 35 Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 Net sales $ 567,762 $ 555,233 Percentage change from comparable period 2.3 % 6.8 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 117,812 $ 116,288 Percentage change from comparable period 1.3 % 6.9 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 20.8 % 20.9 % For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $2.5 billion as compared to the previous year, partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment. For fiscal 2021, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was flat when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from strong growth in comparable sales, offset by $4.0 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As such, we continue to allocate more capital to supply chain, omni-channel initiatives, technology and store remodels and less to new store and club openings. The following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Fiscal Years Ended January 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2022 2021 Supply chain, omni-channel, technology and other $ 7,197 $ 5,681 Remodels 3,278 2,013 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 134 134 Total U.S. $ 10,609 $ 7,828 Walmart International 2,497 2,436 Total capital expenditures $ 13,106 $ 10,264 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.6% for both fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. ROI was 14.9% and 14.0% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, which increased primarily due to the increase in operating income. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain 36 expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 13,940 $ 13,706 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 248,678 $ 244,496 Return on assets (ROA) 5.6 % 5.6 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 25,942 $ 22,548 + Interest income 158 121 + Depreciation and amortization 10,658 11,152 + Rent 2,274 2,626 ROI operating income $ 39,032 $ 36,447 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 248,678 $ 244,496 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 98,199 94,351 - Average accounts payable (1) 52,201 48,057 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 32,013 30,131 Average invested capital $ 262,663 $ 260,659 Return on investment (ROI) 14.9 % 14.0 % (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. As of January 31, 2022 2021 2020 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 244,860 $ 252,496 $ 236,495 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 102,211 94,187 94,514 Accounts payable 55,261 49,141 46,973 Accrued liabilities 26,060 37,966 22,296 Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See "" Liquidity and Capital Resources "" for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $24.2 billion, $36.1 billion and $25.3 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $11.1 billion, $25.8 billion and $14.6 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 due to the same reasons as the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $2.8 billion in increased capital expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021 increased when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments. Free cash flow for 37 fiscal 2021 increased when compared to fiscal 2020 due to the same reasons as the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in decreased capital expenditures. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 24,181 $ 36,074 $ 25,255 Payments for property and equipment (13,106) (10,264) (10,705) Free cash flow $ 11,075 $ 25,810 $ 14,550 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (6,015) $ (10,071) $ (9,128) Net cash used in financing activities (22,828) (16,117) (14,299) (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 2020 Total revenues $ 572,754 $ 559,151 $ 523,964 Percentage change from comparable period 2.4 % 6.7 % 1.9 % Net sales $ 567,762 $ 555,233 $ 519,926 Percentage change from comparable period 2.3 % 6.8 % 1.9 % Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 7.7 % 8.7 % 2.7 % Gross profit rate 24.4 % 24.3 % 24.1 % Operating income $ 25,942 $ 22,548 $ 20,568 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.6 % 4.1 % 4.0 % Loss on extinguishment of debt $ 2,410 $ — $ — Other (gains) and losses $ 3,000 $ (210) $ (1,958) Consolidated net income $ 13,940 $ 13,706 $ 15,201 Unit counts at period end (1) 10,593 11,443 11,501 Retail square feet at period end (1) 1,060 1,121 1,129 (1) Unit counts and associated retail square feet are presented for stores and clubs generally open as of period end, and reflects the removal of stores in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to closing the divestitures in fiscal 2022. Permanently closed locations are not included. Our total revenues, which includes net sales and membership and other income, increased $13.6 billion or 2.4% and $35.2 billion or 6.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenues were primarily due to increases in net sales, which increased $12.5 billion or 2.3% and $35.3 billion or 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which benefited from strong U.S. consumer spending and some inflation, along with positive comparable sales in most of our remaining international markets. The increase was partially offset by a $32.6 billion net sales decrease primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net sales also benefited from a $4.5 billion positive impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments as well as positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets resulting from increased demand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall net sales growth was strong despite certain operating limitations in several international markets in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The net sales increase was partially offset by a negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion. Our gross profit rate increased 14 and 20 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost 38 inflation as well as merchandise mix, partially offset by increased supply chain costs. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to strategic sourcing initiatives, strong sales in higher margin categories, and fewer markdowns. This was partially offset in the Walmart U.S. segment by carryover of prior year price investment as well as the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $2.5 billion as compared to the previous year, partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment. For fiscal 2021, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was flat when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from strong growth in comparable sales, offset by $4.0 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022 due to the early retirement of certain higher rate long-term debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. Other gains and losses consisted of a net loss of $3.0 billion and a net gain of $0.2 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The loss in fiscal 2022 primarily reflects net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, as well as $0.4 billion in incremental losses associated with the divestiture of certain international operations which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The gain in fiscal 2021 primarily reflects $8.7 billion in net gains associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, partially offset by the $8.3 billion pre-tax loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021. Our effective income tax rate was 25.4% for fiscal 2022, 33.3% for fiscal 2021, and 24.4% for fiscal 2020. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, and the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, is primarily due to the $8.3 billion loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021, which provided minimal realizable tax benefit. Our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 is presented in Note 9 . As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $13.9 billion and $13.7 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represents an increase of $0.2 billion and a decrease of $1.5 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart (""EPS"") was $4.87, $4.75 and $5.19 for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Walmart U.S. Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 2020 Net sales $ 393,247 $ 369,963 $ 341,004 Percentage change from comparable period 6.3 % 8.5 % 2.8 % Calendar comparable sales increase 6.4 % 8.7 % 2.9 % Operating income $ 21,587 $ 19,116 $ 17,380 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.5 % 5.2 % 5.1 % Unit counts at period end 4,742 4,743 4,756 Retail square feet at period end 703 703 703 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $23.3 billion or 6.3% and $29.0 billion or 8.5% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable sales of 6.4% and 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Comparable sales in fiscal 2022 were driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which includes strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, average ticket increased while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips and purchased larger baskets. Transaction growth turned positive in April 2021 and continued with strong growth through the rest of the year as customers' pre-pandemic behaviors largely resumed. Comparable sales in fiscal 2021 were driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from meeting the increased demand due to economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% and 5.4% to comparable sales for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. Gross profit rate increased 51 basis points for fiscal 2022 and was flat for fiscal 2021, when compared to the respective previous fiscal year. The increase in fiscal 2022 gross profit rate was primarily due to price management driven by cost inflation as well merchandise mix, which includes lapping the temporary closures of our Auto Care and Vision Centers and 39 growth in our advertising business, partially offset by increased supply chain costs. Gross profit rate for fiscal 2021 benefited from strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns, but was offset by a change in merchandise mix, the carryover effect of prior price investment and the temporary closure of our Auto Care and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 31 basis points for fiscal 2022 when compared to the previous fiscal year. Despite the strong sales growth described above, fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased primarily due to investments in wages, partially offset by lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $1.9 billion. For fiscal 2021, operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 15 basis points primarily due to strong sales, which were partially offset by $3.2 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic including special bonuses, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, costs associated with outfitting our stores and associates with masks, gloves and sanitizer, and expanded cleaning practices. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $2.5 billion and increased $1.7 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 2020 Net sales $ 100,959 $ 121,360 $ 120,130 Percentage change from comparable period (16.8) % 1.0 % (0.6) % Operating income $ 3,758 $ 3,660 $ 3,370 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.7 % 3.0 % 2.8 % Unit counts at period end 5,251 6,101 6,146 Retail square feet at period end 277 337 345 Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $20.4 billion or 16.8% and increased $1.2 billion or 1.0% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the reduction in net sales was driven by a $32.6 billion decrease primarily related to the divestitures of Asda and Seiyu, which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This decrease was partially offset by positive comparable sales in most of our remaining markets, as well as positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.5 billion. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion. The pandemic led to significant economic pressures and channel and mix shifts due to changes in consumer behavior, including accelerated growth in eCommerce in several markets. While several of our markets experienced extensive store and operational closures in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of government mandates, most closed stores and warehouses had resumed operations by the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Gross profit rate decreased 55 basis points and increased 50 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats and the impact related to our divested markets. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to Flipkart's improved margin mix and reduced fuel sales in the U.K. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 71 basis points and increased 14 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to impacts from the divested markets and $0.4 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to $0.5 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and lapping a $0.4 billion non-cash impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2020. Operating income for fiscal 2022 included a $0.3 billion impact from positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and fiscal 2021 included a $0.2 billion impact from negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. 40 Sam's Club Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 2020 Including Fuel Net sales $ 73,556 $ 63,910 $ 58,792 Percentage change from comparable period 15.1 % 8.7 % 1.6 % Calendar comparable sales increase 15.0 % 8.7 % 1.6 % Operating income $ 2,259 $ 1,906 $ 1,642 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.1 % 3.0 % 2.8 % Unit counts at period end 600 599 599 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 64,860 $ 59,184 $ 52,792 Percentage change from comparable period 9.6 % 12.1 % 0.9 % Operating income $ 1,923 $ 1,645 $ 1,486 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.0 % 2.8 % 2.8 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $9.6 billion or 15.1% and $5.1 billion or 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.7%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% to comparable sales. Gross profit rate decreased 68 basis points and increased 65 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales. For fiscal 2021 , gross profit rate increased due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. Membership and other income increased 13.1% and 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members and increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 basis points and increased 42 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. Despite the increased sales growth described above, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 41 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 24,181 $ 36,074 $ 25,255 Net cash provided by operating activities was $24.2 billion, $36.1 billion and $25.3 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $14.8 billion and $17.7 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our working capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $6.3 billion and $2.6 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. While we are currently evaluating recent regulations issued from the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") and the U.S. Treasury Department, we do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial position or results of operations. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, cash and cash equivalents of $4.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $4.3 billion as of January 31, 2022, approximately $2.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized by Flipkart. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash used in investing activities $ (6,015) $ (10,071) $ (9,128) Net cash used in investing activities was $6.0 billion, $10.1 billion and $9.1 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and generally consisted of capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4.1 billion for fiscal 2022 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the net proceeds received from the divestitures of Asda and Seiyu, partially offset by increased capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities increased $0.9 billion for fiscal 2021 when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily as a result of lapping the net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in Walmart Canada and the change in other investing activities, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures. Capital expenditures Refer to the "" Strategic Capital Allocation "" section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2022 and 2021. For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023""), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $18 billion, with a focus on supply chain, automation, customer-facing initiatives and technology. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash used in financing activities $ (22,828) $ (16,117) $ (14,299) Net cash from financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Fiscal 2022 net cash used in financing activities increased $6.7 billion when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and related payment 42 of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes, as well as increased share repurchases, partially offset by new long-term debt issuances in the current year and equity funding from the sale of subsidiary stock. Fiscal 2021 net cash used in financing activities increased $1.8 billion for fiscal 2021 when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the timing of issuances and repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by both a reduction in cash used to pay down short-term borrowings as well as share repurchases. Sale of Subsidiary Stoc k During fiscal 2022, the Company received $3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary, which reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 83% as of January 31, 2021 to approximately 75%. Short-term Borrowings We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end $ 716 $ 4,048 $ 13,315 Average daily short-term borrowings 626 1,577 7,120 Annual weighted-average interest rate 3.7 % 3.1 % 2.5 % Short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, with weighted-average interest rates of 2.9% and 1.9%, respectively. We also have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. as of January 31, 2022 that provide additional liquidity, if needed. Additionally, we maintain access to various credit facilities outside of the U.S. to further support our Walmart International segment operations, as needed. As of January 31, 2022, we have $1.8 billion of syndicated and fronted letters of credit available, of which $1.7 billion was drawn and represents an unrecorded current obligation. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2022: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2021 $ 3,115 $ 41,194 $ 44,309 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 6,945 6,945 Repayments of long-term debt (3,010) (10,000) (13,010) Reclassifications of long-term debt 2,687 (2,687) — Currency and other adjustments 11 (588) (577) Balances as of January 31, 2022 $ 2,803 $ 34,864 $ 37,667 Our total outstanding long-term debt decreased $6.6 billion during fiscal 2022, primarily due to the extinguishment and maturities of certain long-term debt, partially offset by the issuance of new long-term debt in September 2021. Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the maturities, extinguishment and issuances of long-term debt. The early extinguishment of certain long-term debt allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. In connection with this early extinguishment of debt, the Company paid premiums of $2.3 billion, which represents the majority of the $2.4 billion loss recorded on the transaction during fiscal 2022. Estimated contractual interest payments associated with our long-term debt amount to $16.0 billion, with approximately $1.3 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2023. Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2022 and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate instruments. Dividends Our total dividend payments were $6.2 billion, $6.1 billion and $6.0 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Effective February 17, 2022, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2022 annual dividend of $2.20 per share. For fiscal 2023, the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.56 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: 43 Record Date Payable Date March 18, 2022 April 4, 2022 May 6, 2022 May 31, 2022 August 12, 2022 September 6, 2022 December 9, 2022 January 3, 2023 Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made prior to February 22, 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of January 31, 2022, authorization for $10.6 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. In fiscal 2023, we plan to spend at least $10 billion in share repurchases. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 2020 Total number of shares repurchased 69.7 19.4 53.9 Average price paid per share $ 140.45 $ 135.20 $ 105.98 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 9,787 $ 2,625 $ 5,717 Material Cash Requirements Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively. As of January 31, 2022, the Company has $27.9 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $9.3 billion is due within one year. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the obligations quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also excluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Capital Resources We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2022, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: 44 Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates. Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. Inventories We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at first-in, first-out (""FIFO""). 45 Impairment of Assets We evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. Impairment charges on assets held and used were immaterial in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2022 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment. In fiscal 2021, the Company's operations in Argentina, the United Kingdom and Japan met the held for sale criteria. As a result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, less costs to sell, which resulted in impairment charges that were included in the total estimated pre-tax loss of $8.3 billion recorded in fiscal 2021, as well as $0.4 billion in incremental charges associated with the United Kingdom and Japan divestitures upon closing of the transactions during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 . Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2022, our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have also historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. Due to certain strategic restructuring decisions, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion in impairment in fiscal 2020 related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software. Contingencies We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 46 Income Taxes Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on estimates. As guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2022, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased $0.2 billion primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2022. 47 Expected Maturity Date (Amounts in millions) Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2026 Fiscal 2027 Thereafter Total Liabilities Short-term borrowings: Variable rate $ 410 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 410 Weighted-average interest rate 2.9 % — % — % — % — % — % 2.9 % Long-term debt (1) : Fixed rate $ 2,803 $ 4,224 $ 3,565 $ 857 $ 2,757 $ 23,461 $ 37,667 Weighted-average interest rate 1.7 % 3.2 % 2.9 % 3.6 % 2.0 % 4.1 % 3.6 % Interest rate derivatives Interest rate swaps: Fixed to variable $ — $ 1,750 $ 1,500 $ — $ — $ 4,771 $ 8,021 Weighted-average pay rate — % 0.7 % 1.4 % — % — % 1.3 % 1.2 % Weighted-average receive rate — % 2.6 % 3.3 % — % — % 2.5 % 2.7 % (1) Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt. As of January 31, 2022, our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 22% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2022 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $0.1 billion. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments and operations in countries other than the U.S., as well as our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt. For fiscal 2022, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets resulted in the $0.6 billion net loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss. We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $1.0 billion and $0.1 billion as of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain currencies in fiscal 2022. The hypothetical result of a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $1.0 billion. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2022 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $40 million. In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies. Investment Risk We are exposed to investment risk primarily related to changes in the stock price of our equity investments with readily determinable fair values. The change in fair value is recorded within other gains and losses and resulted in a loss of $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022 due to net decreases in the stock price of those equity investments. As of January 31, 2022, the fair value of our equity investments with readily determinable fair values was $11.9 billion. As of January 31, 2022, a hypothetical 10% change in the stock price of such investments would have changed the fair value of such investments by approximately $1.2 billion. 48 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. For the Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022 Table of Contents Page Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 42 ) 50 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 52 Consolidated Statements of Income 53 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 54 Consolidated Balance Sheets 55 Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity 56 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 57 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 58 49 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""Consolidated Financial Statements""). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Contingencies Description of the Matter As described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at January 31, 2022, the Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate. For some matters, a liability is not probable, or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. Where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. Management assessed the probability of occurrence and the estimation of any potential loss based on the ability to predict the number of claims that may be filed or whether any loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. For example, in assessing the probability of occurrence in a particular legal proceeding, management exercises judgment to determine if it can predict the number of claims that may be filed and whether it can reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from that proceeding. Auditing management's accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our assessment of the significant judgments made by management when assessing the probability of occurrence for contingencies or when determining whether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made. 50 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and evaluation of contingencies. For example, we tested controls over the Company's assessment of the likelihood of loss and the Company's determinations regarding the measurement of loss. To test the Company's assessment of the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, among other procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors, reviewed opinions provided to the Company by certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and external counsel, and evaluated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal legal counsel. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 1969. Rogers, Arkansas March 18, 2022 51 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated March 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Rogers, Arkansas March 18, 2022 52 Walmart Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General Walmart Inc. (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers. The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022""), January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021"") and January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020""). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2022 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $ 1.7 billion and $ 4.1 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $ 14.8 billion and $ 17.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, approximately 50 % and 40 % were held outside of the U.S., respectively. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations. The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $ 4.3 billion and $ 2.8 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $ 4.3 billion as of January 31, 2022, approximately $ 2.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart"") minority shareholders. Receivables Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which includes pharmacy insurance companies as well as advertisers, and banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. As of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, net receivables from transactions with customers were $ 3.4 billion and $ 2.7 billion, respectively. 58 Inventories The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory for the Walmart International segment is generally valued in most markets by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (""FIFO"") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at first-in, first-out (""FIFO""). Held for Sale Components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale are presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. The Company reviews its businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values. As of January 31, 2022, assets and liabilities held for sale were immaterial. As of January 31, 2021, $ 19.2 billion assets held for sale and $ 12.7 billion liabilities held for sale were classified in prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively, reflecting the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan classified as held for sale which subsequently closed during fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 for additional details. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis: As of January 31, (Amounts in millions) Estimated Useful Lives 2022 2021 Land N/A $ 19,204 $ 19,308 Buildings and improvements 3 - 40 years 100,376 97,582 Fixtures and equipment 1 - 30 years 60,282 56,639 Transportation equipment 3 - 15 years 2,263 2,301 Construction in progress N/A 7,199 4,741 Property and equipment 189,324 180,571 Accumulated depreciation ( 94,809 ) ( 88,370 ) Property and equipment, net $ 94,515 $ 92,201 Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and intangible assets for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 10.7 billion, $ 11.2 billion and $ 11.0 billion, respectively. Leases For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company records right-of-use (""ROU"") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. If the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company's applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments. Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. 59 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. Goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2022, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. Management has performed its evaluation and determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill. The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2022 and 2021: (Amounts in millions) Walmart U.S. Walmart International Sam's Club Total Balances as of February 1, 2020 $ 2,593 $ 28,167 $ 313 $ 31,073 Changes in currency translation and other — 10 — 10 Acquisitions 103 — 8 111 Amounts reclassified related to operations held for sale (1) — ( 2,211 ) — ( 2,211 ) Balances as of January 31, 2021 2,696 25,966 321 28,983 Changes in currency translation and other — ( 415 ) — ( 415 ) Acquisitions 245 201 — 446 Balances as of January 31, 2022 $ 2,941 $ 25,752 $ 321 $ 29,014 (1) Represents goodwill associated with operations in the U.K. and Japan which were classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021. Refer to Note 12 . Intangible assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $ 4.8 billion and $ 4.9 billion, respectively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily consists of acquired trade names. There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2022 or 2021. During fiscal 2020, the Company incurred approximately $ 0.7 billion in impairment charges related to its intangible assets. Refer to Note 8 for additional information. Fair Value Measurement The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Refer to Note 8 for more information. Investments Investments in equity and debt securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value of equity securities measured on a recurring basis are recognized in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 8 for details. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements 60 of Income. Investments in debt securities classified as trading are reported at fair value with interest income recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of January 31, 2022, the Company had $ 1.0 billion in debt securities classified as trading. Indemnification Liabilities The Company has provided certain indemnifications in connection with its divestitures and has recorded indemnification liabilities equal to the estimated fair value of the obligations upon inception. As of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the Company had $ 0.7 billion and $ 0.6 billion, respectively, of certain legal and tax indemnification liabilities recorded within deferred income taxes and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these indemnities was $ 3.5 billion, based on exchange rates as of January 31, 2022. Self Insurance Reserves The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits. Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability. Derivatives The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty. The Company enters into derivatives with counterparties rated generally ""A-"" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The Company is subject to master netting arrangements which provides set-off and close-out netting of exposures with counterparties, but the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's collateral arrangements require the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-determined thresholds, after considering the effects of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral. Cash collateral received from counterparties and cash collateral provided to counterparties under these arrangements was not significant as of January 31, 2022 and 2021. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, derivative gains and losses are recorded through the same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings. Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 8 for the presentation of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities. Fair Value Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2023 to September 2031. Cash Flow Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The Company records changes in the fair value of these swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2022 to January 2039. 61 Net Investment Hedges Prior to the divestiture of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan as discussed in Note 12 , the Company was a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with net investments of these foreign operations. Changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company also previously designated certain foreign currency denominated long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of these divested operations and recorded foreign currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss as discussed in Note 4 . As of January 31, 2021, the Company had $ 3.3 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as net investment hedges. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (""temporary differences""). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates. In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures. Revenue Recognition Net Sales The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or services to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns. Membership Fee Revenue The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $ 2.2 billion for fiscal 2022, $ 1.7 billion for fiscal 2021 and $ 1.5 billion for fiscal 2020, respectively. Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gift Cards Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period. Financial and Other Services The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. 62 Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs. Payments from Suppliers The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold. Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of digital, television and print advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising costs were $ 3.9 billion, $ 3.2 billion and $ 3.7 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements. Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 2020 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 13,940 $ 13,706 $ 15,201 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 267 ) ( 196 ) ( 320 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 13,673 $ 13,510 $ 14,881 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,792 2,831 2,850 Dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards 13 16 18 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,805 2,847 2,868 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 4.90 $ 4.77 $ 5.22 Diluted 4.87 4.75 5.19 63 Note 3. Shareholders' Equity The total authorized shares of $ 0.10 par value common stock is 11.0 billion, of which 2.8 billion were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2022 and 2021. Sale of Subsidiary Stock During fiscal 2022, the Company received $ 3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary, which reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 83 % as of January 31, 2021 to approximately 75 %. Share-Based Compensation The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $ 1.2 billion, $ 1.2 billion and $ 0.9 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $ 0.3 billion, $ 0.3 billion and $ 0.2 billion for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type for all plans: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Restricted stock units $ 659 $ 742 $ 553 Restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units 321 277 270 Other 183 150 31 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,163 $ 1,169 $ 854 The Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the ""Plan""), as subsequently amended and restated, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders. The Plan's award types are summarized as follows: • Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Beginning in fiscal 2020, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 25 % each year over a four year period from the date of the grant. Prior to fiscal 2020, 50 % of restricted stock units generally vested three years from the grant date and the remaining 50 % were vested five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 3.8 %, 4.4 % and 4.9 %, respectively. • Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance-based restricted stock units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and generally range from 0 % to 150 % of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years . Restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 4.2 %, 4.5 % and 5.1 %, respectively. In addition to the Plan, Flipkart has certain share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to acquire Flipkart common shares may be issued. Share-based compensation expense associated with these plans is included in the Other line in the table above. 64 The following table shows the activity for restricted stock units and restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units during fiscal 2022: Restricted Stock Units Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (Shares in thousands) Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share Outstanding as of February 1, 2021 19,900 $ 92.13 5,413 $ 108.72 Granted 8,219 131.90 3,057 135.48 Adjustment for performance achievement (1) — — 920 107.67 Vested/exercised ( 8,051 ) 85.21 ( 2,614 ) 100.30 Forfeited ( 2,785 ) 110.65 ( 636 ) 110.95 Outstanding as of January 31, 2022 17,283 $ 111.42 6,140 $ 125.25 (1) Represents the adjustment to previously granted performance share units for performance achievement.

All repurchases made prior to February 22, 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $ 20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations and the market price of the Company's common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 2020 Total number of shares repurchased 69.7 19.4 53.9 Average price paid per share $ 140.45 $ 135.20 $ 105.98 Total cash paid for share repurchases $ 9,787 $ 2,625 $ 5,717 Note 4.

Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. As described in Note 1 , the Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments on a recurring basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of the Company's equity investments measured on a recurring basis are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of January 31, 2022 Fair Value as of January 31, 2021 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 6,069 $ 6,517 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 5,819 7,905 Total $ 11,888 $ 14,422 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: January 31, 2022 January 31, 2021 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 8,021 $ ( 47 ) (1) $ 3,250 $ 166 (2) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges — — 1,250 311 (2) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 7,855 ( 1,048 ) (1) 5,073 ( 394 ) (1) Total $ 15,876 $ ( 1,095 ) $ 9,573 $ 83 (1) Primarily classified in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Primarily classified in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. Upon completing the sales of Asda in February 2021 and Seiyu in March 2021, the Company recorded incremental non-recurring impairment charges of $ 0.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 12 . The Company did not have other material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of January 31, 2022. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company's operations in Argentina, Japan and the U.K. met the held for sale criteria in fiscal 2021, as further discussed in Note 12 . As a result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, less costs to sell, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement based on each transaction's expected consideration. The carrying value of the Argentina, Japan and U.K. disposal groups exceeded their fair value, less costs to sell, and as a result, the Company recognized non-recurring impairment charges. The aggregate pre-tax loss of $ 8.3 billion associated with the divestiture of these operations in the Walmart International segment was recorded in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended January 31, 2021 and included these impairment charges as well as a $ 2.3 billion charge related to the Asda pension plan. These impairment charges included the anticipated release of non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses associated with the disposal groups. Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2021 were immaterial. 70 For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges related to assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis primarily related to the following: • in the Walmart U.S. segment, $ 0.5 billion in impairment charges for impaired assets consisting primarily of trade names and acquired developed software due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write-down of certain eCommerce assets; and • in the Walmart International segment, $ 0.4 billion in impairment charges consisting primarily of the write-off of the carrying value of one of Flipkart's two fashion trade names, Jabong.com, as a result of a strategic decision to focus on the Myntra.com fashion platform. These impairment charges were classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2020 were immaterial. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, are as follows: January 31, 2022 January 31, 2021 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 37,667 $ 42,381 $ 44,309 $ 54,240 Note 9. Taxes The components of income before income taxes are as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2020 U.S. $ 15,536 $ 18,068 $ 15,019 Non-U.S. 3,160 2,496 5,097 Total income before income taxes $ 18,696 $ 20,564 $ 20,116 A summary of the provision for income taxes is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Current: U.S. federal $ 3,313 $ 2,991 $ 2,794 U.S. state and local 649 742 587 International 1,553 1,127 1,205 Total current tax provision 5,515 4,860 4,586 Deferred: U.S. federal ( 671 ) 2,316 663 U.S. state and local 41 23 35 International ( 129 ) ( 341 ) ( 369 ) Total deferred tax expense (benefit) ( 759 ) 1,998 329 Total provision for income taxes $ 4,756 $ 6,858 $ 4,915 71 Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing operations is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2022 2021 2020 U.S. statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % U.S. state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 2.8 % 2.9 % 2.2 % Income taxed outside the U.S. ( 1.5 ) % ( 0.1 ) % ( 1.0 ) % Disposal and wind-down of certain business operations 0.5 % 7.1 % — % Valuation allowance 4.4 % 2.3 % 2.3 % Net impact of repatriated international earnings ( 0.3 ) % ( 0.4 ) % 0.4 % Federal tax credits ( 1.1 ) % ( 0.9 ) % ( 0.8 ) % Enacted change in tax laws — % — % ( 1.9 ) % Change in reserve for tax contingencies 0.2 % 0.8 % 2.5 % Other, net ( 0.6 ) % 0.6 % ( 0.3 ) % Effective income tax rate 25.4 % 33.3 % 24.4 % The following sections regarding deferred taxes, unremitted earnings, net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards, valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions exclude amounts related to operations classified as held for sale. Deferred Taxes The significant components of the Company's deferred tax account balances are as follows: January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Loss and tax credit carryforwards $ 9,456 $ 9,179 Accrued liabilities 2,752 2,582 Share-based compensation 231 224 Lease obligations 4,320 4,450 Other 893 589 Total deferred tax assets 17,652 17,024 Valuation allowances ( 9,542 ) ( 8,782 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 8,110 8,242 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment 4,414 4,802 Acquired intangibles 1,065 1,071 Inventory 1,588 1,235 Lease right of use assets 4,355 4,390 Mark-to-market investments 1,825 2,678 Other 307 675 Total deferred tax liabilities 13,554 14,851 Net deferred tax liabilities $ 5,444 $ 6,609 The deferred taxes noted above are classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Balance Sheet classification Assets: Other long-term assets $ 1,473 $ 1,836 Liabilities: Deferred income taxes and other 6,917 8,445 Net deferred tax liabilities $ 5,444 $ 6,609 72 Unremitted Earnings Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act""), the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings, and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. As of January 31, 2022, the Company has not recorded approximately $ 3 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation. Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances As of January 31, 2022, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $ 39.3 billion. Of these carryforwards, approximately $ 26.6 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2042. The remaining carryforwards have no expiration. The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To the extent that a valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company had valuation allowances of $ 9.5 billion and $ 8.8 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with the net operating loss carryforwards. Activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2022 related to valuation allowance builds in multiple markets, as well as releases due to the expiration of underlying deferred tax assets. Uncertain Tax Positions The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $ 3.2 billion and $ 3.1 billion, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $ 1.8 billion and $ 1.7 billion as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 3,135 $ 1,817 $ 1,305 Increases related to prior year tax positions 170 92 516 Decreases related to prior year tax positions ( 97 ) ( 264 ) ( 15 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 75 1,582 66 Settlements during the period ( 5 ) ( 64 ) ( 29 ) Lapse in statutes of limitations ( 33 ) ( 28 ) ( 26 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 3,245 $ 3,135 $ 1,817 The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. Interest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as expeditiously as possible. As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months. The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2014, and 2018 through 2022. The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2013 through 2022, and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2013 through 2022. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2013. 73 Other Taxes The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments and judgments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 10. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Opioids Litigation In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL"") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. The liability phase of a trial in one of the MDL cases began on October 4, 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims. On November 23, 2021, the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the trial, which will determine amounts owed by the defendants, is currently scheduled to begin on May 10, 2022. The Company intends to appeal the jury verdict from the liability phase upon completion of the abatement phase of the trial. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA""). The Company's action was dismissed. The Company had appealed this decision to the Fifth Circuit. On December 22, 2021, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the action. On December 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the CSA. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. The DOJ filed its opposition brief on April 23, 2021 and the Company filed its reply brief on May 24, 2021. On November 19, 2021, the District Court stayed further proceedings in the DOJ complaint pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in two consolidated cases (not involving Walmart) interpreting the CSA. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action; the lead plaintiff responded to the motion on January 10, 2022; and the defendants filed their reply brief on February 10, 2022. Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other Opioids 74 Litigation matters. On September 27, 2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the current Board and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business. The defendants filed the opening brief on their motion to dismiss that case on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from the various Opioids Litigation and intends to vigorously defend these litigation matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Asda Equal Value Claims Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees (the ""Asda Equal Value Claims""), and further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company will continue to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters. Note 11. Retirement-Related Benefits The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches 100 % of participant contributions up to 6 % of annual eligible earnings. The matching contributions immediately vest at 100 % for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50 % of their pre-tax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits. Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established. The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Defined contribution plans: U.S. $ 1,441 $ 1,290 $ 1,184 International 39 200 177 Total contribution expense for defined contribution plans $ 1,480 $ 1,490 $ 1,361 Additionally, the Company's previously owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom sponsored a defined benefit pension plan. In fiscal 2020, Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the ""Plan"") entered into an agreement pursuant to which Asda made a cash contribution of $ 1.0 billion to the Plan (the ""Asda Pension Contribution"") which enabled the Plan to purchase a bulk annuity insurance contract for the benefit of Plan participants, and released the Plan and Asda from any future obligations. In connection with the sale of Asda, all accumulated pension components of $ 2.3 billion were included in the disposal group and the estimated pre-tax loss recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as discussed in Note 8 and Note 12 . 75 Note 12. Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items The following disposals impact the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or been announced. Asda In February 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Asda, the Company's retail operations in the U.K., for net consideration of $ 9.6 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $ 0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Asda and recognized its retained investment in Asda as a debt security within other long-term assets and also recognized certain legal and tax indemnity liabilities within deferred income taxes and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Asda was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $ 5.5 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Upon classifying the Asda disposal group as held for sale, $ 2.3 billion of accumulated pension components associated with the expected derecognition of the Asda pension plan were included as part of the loss. In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by approximately $ 0.8 billion related to the estimated fair value of certain indemnities and other transaction related costs. Seiyu In March 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Seiyu, the Company's retail operations in Japan, for net consideration of $ 1.2 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $ 0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Seiyu and recognized its retained 15 percent ownership interest in Seiyu as an equity investment within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Seiyu was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $ 1.9 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Assets and liabilities held for sale associated with the Asda and Seiyu disposal groups as of January 31, 2021 were as follows: January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,848 Other current assets (1) 2,545 Property and equipment, net 13,193 Operating lease right-of-use assets 4,360 Finance lease right-of-use assets, net 1,395 Goodwill 2,211 Other long-term assets 1,063 Valuation allowance against assets held for sale (2) ( 7,420 ) Total assets held for sale $ 19,195 Current liabilities (3) 6,535 Operating lease obligations, including amounts due within one year 4,245 Finance lease obligations, including amounts due within one year 1,495 Deferred income taxes and other 459 Total liabilities held for sale $ 12,734 (1) Includes inventories, receivables, net and prepaid expenses and other. (2) Includes the $ 2.3 billion loss associated with the derecognition of the Asda pension plan and $ 1.3 billion cumulative foreign currency and related net investment hedge and other impacts included within the disposal groups, which were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss upon closure of each transaction. (3) Includes accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Walmart Argentina In November 2020, the Company completed the sale of Walmart Argentina. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $ 1.0 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income primarily due to the impact of cumulative translation losses on the carrying value of the disposal group. 76 Note 13. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of recent divestitures. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (""COSO"") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2022. The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report which appears herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

BUSINESS General Walmart Inc. (""Walmart,"" the ""Company"" or ""we"") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve over 240 million customers who visit approximately 11,400 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 54 banners in 26 countries. Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (""EDLP""). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost (""EDLC"") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021""), January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020"") and January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019""). During fiscal 2021, we generated total revenues of $559.2 billion, which was primarily comprised of net sales of $555.2 billion. We maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""WMT."" The Development of Our Company The businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2021, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 25 countries. In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have approximately 7,300 pickup and 5,200 delivery locations globally. In recent years, we have heavily invested in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, as well as made several eCommerce acquisitions to better serve our customers. These investments have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, incubate digitally-native brands, and expand our assortment and service offerings in stores and on walmart.com. We have also continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives internationally, such as with our acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart""), which is our ecosystem in India that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform. In fiscal 2021, we launched Walmart+ in the U.S., a new membership offering with omni-channel shopping benefits that currently include unlimited free shipping on eligible items with no order minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel discounts, and mobile scan & go for a streamlined in-store shopping experience. We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, services, eCommerce sites and supply chain combined with our more than 2.3 million associates as of January 31, 2021 to better serve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates customer relationships where customers view Walmart as their primary destination. During fiscal 2021, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While we have incurred incremental costs associated with operating during a global health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated our business growth and eCommerce expansion. We have continued to invest in our omni-channel offering which resonates with customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience. 6 Information About Our Segments We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company also engaged in operations in the U.K. and Japan, both of which were classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021. We also operated in Argentina and Brazil prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in November 2020 and the majority stake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these divestitures. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club, which are further described below. Each segment contributes to the Company's operating results differently. However, each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Walmart U.S. Segment Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the ""Walmart"" and ""Walmart Neighborhood Market"" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $370.0 billion for fiscal 2021, representing 67% of our fiscal 2021 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $341.0 billion and $331.7 billion for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate""). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. Omni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, through services such as pickup and delivery, ship-from-store, and digital pharmacy fulfillment options. As of January 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,750 pickup locations and 3,000 delivery locations. Our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. We have several eCommerce websites, the largest of which is walmart.com. We define eCommerce sales as sales initiated by customers digitally and fulfilled by a number of methods including our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and leveraging our stores. The following table provides the approximate size of our retail stores as of January 31, 2021: Minimum Square Feet Maximum Square Feet Average Square Feet Supercenters (general merchandise and grocery) 69,000 260,000 178,000 Discount stores (general merchandise and limited grocery) 30,000 221,000 106,000 Neighborhood markets (1) (grocery) 28,000 65,000 42,000 (1) Excludes other small formats. Merchandise. Walmart U.S. does business in three strategic merchandise units, listed below: • Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat, produce, deli & bakery, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, pet supplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products; • General merchandise includes: ◦ Entertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music and books); ◦ Hardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery); ◦ Apparel (e.g., apparel for men, women, girls, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and ◦ Home (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed & bath, furniture and home organization, home furnishings, home decor, fabrics and crafts). • Health and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical services and clinical services. Walmart U.S. recently launched Walmart+, a membership offering providing omni-channel shopping benefits such as unlimited free shipping on eligible items with no order minimums, as well as delivery and other benefits which help customers save more time and money. Walmart U.S. also offers an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, as well as quality, affordable, and accessible healthcare via Walmart Health. Additional service offerings include fuel and financial services and related products, such as money orders, prepaid cards, money (wire) transfers, check cashing and bill payment. Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues. Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private-label brands, including brands such as: ""Allswell,"" ""Athletic Works,"" ""Bonobos,"" ""Eloquii,"" 7 ""Equate,"" ""Freshness Guaranteed,"" ""George,"" ""Great Value,"" ""Holiday Time,"" ""Mainstays,"" ""Marketside,"" ""No Boundaries,"" ""Onn,"" ""Ozark Trail,"" ""Parent's Choice,"" ""Sam's Choice,"" ""Scoop,"" ""Spring Valley,"" ""SwissTech,"" ""Time and Tru"" and ""Wonder Nation."" The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: ""Better Homes & Gardens,"" ""Farberware,"" ""Pioneer Woman"" and ""Russell."" Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability. Operations. Historically, many supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets were generally open 24 hours each day. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced store hours to allow for additional cleaning and sanitizing but expanded store hours slightly toward the end of fiscal 2021. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services that help better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, Walmart+, ship-from-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on consumer behaviors that could result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, as well as eCommerce retailers. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following: • EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity; • EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; and • Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our new Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served. Distribution. For fiscal 2021, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through our 156 distribution facilities, which are located strategically throughout the U.S. The remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 32 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship directly from approximately 3,000 stores. Walmart International Segment Walmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 25 countries outside of the U.S as of January 31, 2021. Walmart International operated through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, and China, as well as our businesses classified as held for sale in Japan and the United Kingdom as of January 31, 2021. Walmart International also operates through our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua), India and Mexico. Walmart International previously operated in Argentina and Brazil prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and the majority stake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of recent divestitures. Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $121.4 billion for fiscal 2021, representing 22% of our fiscal 2021 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $120.1 billion and $120.8 billion for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The segment's net sales were negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. 8 Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years: • Acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018. • Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil in August 2018. • Divestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the divestiture of the Walmart Canada banking operations in April 2019. • Divestiture of Walmart Argentina in November 2020. • Divestiture of Asda Group Limited (""Asda”), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021. • Divestiture of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021. Omni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets, our marketplaces such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India. In China, our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia provide customers one-hour delivery by leveraging Walmart stores as fulfillment centers. Generally, retail units' selling area range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling area generally range in size from 24,000 square feet to 156,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2021, Walmart International had approximately 3,000 pickup and 2,200 delivery locations. Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as ""Equate,"" ""George,"" ""Great Value,"" ""Holiday Time,"" ""Mainstays,"" ""Marketside"" and ""Parent's Choice,"" our international markets have developed market specific brands including ""Aurrera,"" ""Cambridge,"" ""Lider,"" ""Myntra,"" and ""PhonePe."" In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices. Walmart International also offers fuel, financial services and related products in various markets. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money (wire) transfers, and our PhonePe business in India provides a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising. Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Toward the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, government mandates led to extensive store and operational closures in several of our international markets as well as limitations on certain merchandise sales in select markets. While most closed stores and warehouses resumed operations by the end of fiscal 2021, store hours have been partially reduced or modified in several markets. Additionally, several markets implemented enhanced safety and sanitization protocols, as well as provided increased customer options and capacity for pickup and delivery services. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, its highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on consumer behaviors that could result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. Competition. Walmart International competes with omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. 9 Distribution. We utilize a total of 221 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mexico and South Africa, as well as Japan and the United Kingdom, whose operations are classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021, and subsequently divested in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2021, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and distribution and fulfillment centers which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 83 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, more than 2,800 eCommerce sort centers and last-mile delivery facilities in India, as well as our physical retail stores. Sam's Club Segment Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club had net sales of $63.9 billion for fiscal 2021, representing 11% of our consolidated fiscal 2021 net sales, and had net sales of $58.8 billion and $57.8 billion for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. Membership. The following two options are available to members: Plus Membership Club Membership Annual Membership Fee $100 $45 Number of Add-on Memberships ($40 each) Up to 16 Up to 8 Eligible for Cash Rewards Yes No All memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost.

The amount earned can be used for purchases or redeemed for cash. Plus Members are also eligible for free shipping on the majority of merchandise, with no minimum order size, and receive discounts on prescriptions and glasses. Omni-channel. Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club which provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce through such services as Curbside Pickup, mobile Scan & Go, and ship-from-club. Members have access to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, including those not found in our clubs, online at samsclub.com and through our mobile commerce applications. The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 32,000 and 168,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet. Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories: • Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items; • Fuel, tobacco and other categories consists of gasoline stations and tobacco; • Home and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, tools and power equipment, housewares, toys, seasonal items, mattresses, and tire and battery centers; • Technology, office and entertainment includes consumer electronics and accessories, software, video games, office supplies, appliances, and third-party gift cards; and • Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services and over-the-counter drugs. In addition, the Member's Mark private label brand continues to expand assortment and deliver member value. Operations. Operating hours for Sam's Clubs are generally Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, most club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 8:00 a.m. While store operating hours generally remained stable during the COVID-19 pandemic, designated “Hero Hours” were also established for first responders, health care workers, and associates. Consistent with its strategy, Sam's Club continues to develop technology tools to drive a great member experience. During the pandemic, Curbside Pickup was launched at all clubs to help provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members. Sam's Club also offers ""Scan & Go,"" a mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line. 10 Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on consumer behaviors that could result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete and recently enabled the launch of Curbside Pickup across all clubs. Distribution. During fiscal 2021, the majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from Sam's Club's 27 dedicated distribution facilities, located strategically throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. Suppliers shipped the remainder of the Sam's Club segment's club purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs, 11 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers. Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties. Suppliers and Supply Chain As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the ""fresh"" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of the annual sales for a number of our suppliers, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members. Government Regulation As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in "" Item 1A . Risk Factors "" under the sub-caption “Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks"". 11 Human Capital Management Our commitment to help people around the world save money and live better is delivered by our associates who make the difference for our customers every day. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we employed more than 2.3 million associates worldwide, with 1.6 million associates in the U.S. and 0.7 million associates internationally. In the U.S., approximately 94% of these associates are hourly and approximately 64% are full-time. We believe the strength of our workforce is a significant contributor to our success. Walmart is a place of opportunity, not only as a foundational entry point to develop critical skills that are relevant for a variety of careers, but also a place where people can grow in their careers across our global omni-channel business. As customer demands and technology change the nature of work, we need to attract, develop and retain associates to thrive in an ever-changing omni-channel environment. Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers in hourly positions. We believe our focus on improving career paths for our associates through robust training, competitive wages, new ways of working, and opportunities for advancement has improved turnover in the U.S. over the past few years. Our workforce strategy includes the following strategic priorities: Inclusion - Build a Walmart for everyone: a diverse, equitable and inclusive company, where associates' ideas and opinions matter . We are focused on creating an inclusive culture and a diverse associate base, where all associates believe they belong and are empowered to be themselves, which we believe is important in serving our customers now and in the future. Management provides recurring culture, diversity, equity and inclusion updates to senior leadership, including our President and CEO, and the Compensation, Management and Development Committee of the Board of Directors. Of the more than 2.3 million associates employed worldwide, 54% identify as women. In the U.S., 47% of the 1.6 million associates identify as ethnically diverse. We review our processes regarding our commitment to fair-pay practices. We are committed to creating a performance culture where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance and the type of work they do. To build a company where associates feel valued and heard, we gather and respond to associates’ feedback in a variety of ways, including but not limited to an anonymous, periodic, formal, associate engagement survey, our Open Door process, and one-on-one interactions. Management reviews the results of feedback obtained from our formal associate engagement survey. Feedback and suggestions received through these channels have led to meaningful changes in our business, including a new U.S. attendance policy, for example. Well-being - Focus on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our associates. We invest in our associates by offering competitive wages including bonuses based on Company performance, as well as a broad range of benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements and believe these investments in our associates are important to our future. In the U.S., we offer affordable healthcare coverage to our full-time and eligible part-time associates, as well as Company paid benefits such as a store discount card or Sam's Club membership, 401(k) match, maternity leave, a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates, paid time off, Associate Stock Purchase Plan match, life insurance and behavioral health services. Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In fiscal 2021, we added incremental benefits to support associate health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. We provided extra pay and benefits, including special cash bonuses totaling $1.6 billion, and the introduction of the COVID-19 Emergency Leave Policy in the U.S. See "" COVID-19 Updates "" in Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information regarding our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Growth - Provide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue to attract talent with new skills. To help associates acquire the experiences and skills needed for success in the jobs of today and tomorrow, we have invested in their development – including new roles and career paths, cross-training, on-the-job coaching, and formal, classroom-style training such as Walmart Academy in the U.S. We also provide access to educational opportunities for our eligible associates through our Live Better U program, which provides a pathway to earn a high school diploma at no cost or a college degree for $1 a day, as well as multiple digital learning opportunities. Digital - Accelerate digital transformation and ways of working to improve the associate experience and drive business results . To deliver a seamless customer and associate experience, we continue to invest in digital tools to improve associate productivity, engagement, and performance. As more customers shop digitally, we have adapted by adding more roles in eCommerce fulfillment and our home office associates have accelerated tech-based solutions that enhance the customer and associate experiences. 12 Information About Our Executive Officers The following chart names the executive officers of the Company as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, each of whom is elected by and serves at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.

RISK FACTORS The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face. Strategic Risks Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance. The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate. Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A . Failure to successfully execute this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance. Furthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term. If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those related to sustainability) and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business. 14 We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See "" Item 1. Business "" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments. Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to bankruptcy, consolidation or other factors. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets. In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our business. These arrangements may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, business relationship or in certain of our recently divested markets, could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 15 Operational Risks The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial position and results of operations is in many respects unpredictable, and we may be unable to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future. The continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are highly unpredictable and volatile, with varying impacts on certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and on our domestic and international associates, members, suppliers and other people and entities with which we do business. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns and other restrictions on retailers. Customer demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and customer behaviors have changed, which has challenged our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors have resulted in higher out-of-stock positions in certain products, as well as delays in delivering those products, and could impact inventory levels in the future. Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we operate; further increased operational costs associated with operating during a global pandemic; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the availability of, and prevalence of access to, effective medical treatments and vaccines for COVID-19; the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors. These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased revenue growth relative to historic trends, and has particularly accelerated our eCommerce growth. These results, as well as those of other metrics such as net income and other financial and operating data, may not be indicative of results for future periods. Once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, particularly as vaccines become more widely available, and customers return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to the aforementioned containment directives and similar mandates, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities may result in declining revenue and future operating results may fall below expectations. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global economy, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements. Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, global health epidemics or pandemics and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical events; global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores. 16 Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes over time could affect, for example, the availability and cost of certain consumer products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure those certain goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to such sales apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth strategy. We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations. Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyberattacks from cyberattackers and sophisticated organizations including nation states), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors. Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. Our information systems are not 17 fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media, online advertising, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and shipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' information including payment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A . Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse and/or loss, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity, and our ability to efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business. Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Like most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyberattackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and disruptions. The increased use of remote work infrastructure due to the COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Some of our systems and third-party service providers' systems have experienced limited security breaches or incidents and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. 18 Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. Any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. Our compliance programs, information technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk. Disruptions in our systems caused by security breaches or cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do business with – could harm our ability to conduct our operations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our partners, third-party service providers, customers, financial services firms, and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis. In addition, such security-related events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial position and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security compromise or ransomware event could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security breaches or other compromises from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be developed in the future. In certain circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. Additionally, we offer money (wire) transfer services, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders and check cashing and we sell prepaid cards and gift cards. We further offer co-branded credit cards and installment loans through financial services partners. These products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation. The Company also has compliance obligations associated with new privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and transfer of personal information, which include statutory liability for security breaches. Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subject us to fines, sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation. 19 Changes in the results of our health and wellness business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, as well as the recent addition of Walmart Health Centers in a number of states. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (""PBMs""). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options with or without home delivery options; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use of third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and any additional changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business. If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies. One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. 20 Financial Risks Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts or, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations. Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations. We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations. Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance. In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. During fiscal 2021, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 22% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), antitrust and competition law regulatory matters (such as the competition investigations currently underway in Mexico related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico, in Canada related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart Canada and competition proceedings in India related to our Flipkart subsidiary), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. 21 The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and regulations of other countries. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance. In fiscal 2021, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 78% of our consolidated net sales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business. We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles. We are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, any of which can impact our current and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act"") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations and additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies is still pending. As further guidance is issued by these taxing authorities, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act, including collecting information not regularly produced by the Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations. In addition, in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the global spread of COVID-19, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes. The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate. Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made. 22 Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance. We operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Our operations in the U.S. are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements and reimbursement arrangements affecting our health and wellness operations. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act, laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the ""FDA"") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the ""DEA""), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; patient inducement regulations; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and health care services. For example, in the U.S., the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available, such as our money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, sanctions, fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protection. We are also subject to data privacy and protection laws regulating the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal information, such as the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”), which was recently significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), as well as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The potential effects of these laws are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. In the case of non-compliance with a material provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover in the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach. The CCPA and CPRA give California residents expanded rights to access, correct and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Furthermore, our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. We may be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including changing some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. 23 While we strive to adhere our practices and procedures to these laws, they are subject to evolving regulations, interpretations and regulator discretion. To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; loss of licenses; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug suppliers and third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and results of operations. We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental authorities. We may also have indemnification obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collective-action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”). The Company’s action was dismissed and the Company is appealing the decision. On December 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies in violation of the CSA. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company’s disclosures with respect to opioids filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. A derivative action was also filed by one of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company’s distribution and dispensing of opioids. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters. We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption "" Item 3. Legal Proceedings "" and in Note 10 in the "" Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements ,"" which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 24 Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our shareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. The exclusive forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under, the federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

National Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of March 5, 2021, some of which cases are in the process of being transferred to the MDL. A trial previously scheduled to begin on May 10, 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing and distribution claims has been postponed and rescheduled for October 4, 2021. A separate trial in the MDL that had been expected to start in November 2020 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid distribution claims has been postponed indefinitely. There is one case in which the Company is named as a defendant that was remanded from the MDL court to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. In addition, there are over 200 state court cases pending as of March 5, 2021, some of which may be removed to federal court to seek MDL transfer. The case citations for the state cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. DOJ Opioid Litigation: On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”) . The Company’s action, Walmart Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice et al., USDC, Eastern Dist. of Texas, 10/22/20, was dismissed and the Company is appealing the decision. A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the DOJ against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the CSA related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al ., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation : A derivative complaint and class action lawsuits drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming various current and former directors and certain officers as defendants. The plaintiff in the derivative suit (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) alleges, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended regarding the Company’s disclosures with respect to opioids were purportedly filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020 . Derivative Lawsuit: Abt v. Alvarez et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21. Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21; Martin v. Walmart Inc. et al ., USDC, Dist. of DE, 3/5/21. II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS: The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company’s consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company’s money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas and is cooperating with the government’s investigation. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and is cooperating with the FTC’s investigation related to money transfers and the Company’s anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigations or any related actions by the governmental entities regarding these matters at this time. While the Company does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters to disclose for this period. 29 ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. PART II ITEM 5.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA This Item is reserved as a result of the Company’s early adoption of Item 301 of Regulation S-K, as deleted pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-10890; 34-90459 (Management’s Discussion and Analysis; Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information) adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 19, 2020. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021""), January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020"") and January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019""), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial position and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Generally, our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31; however, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on consumer behaviors that could result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. We have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including the following highlights over the last three years: • Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart"") in August 2018. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the transaction. • Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the transaction. • Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile and Walmart Canada in December 2018 and April 2019, respectively. • In October 2020, we agreed to sell Asda for net consideration of $9.4 billion and recognized an estimated non-cash loss in fiscal 2021 of $5.7 billion, after tax, which includes the loss associated with the expected derecognition of the Asda pension plan. In February 2021, we completed the sale of Asda. Refer to Note 11 and Note 12 . • In November 2020, we completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and recorded a non-cash loss of $1.0 billion, after-tax, primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation losses. Refer to Note 12 . 33 • In November 2020, we agreed to sell a majority stake in Seiyu for net consideration of approximately $1.2 billion and recognized an estimated non-cash loss of $1.9 billion, after-tax, in fiscal 2021. In March 2021, we completed the sale of Seiyu. Refer to Note 12 . We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates. We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, global health epidemics including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under "" Item 1A. Risk Factors ."" COVID-19 Updates Throughout fiscal 2021, we have operated with a clear set of priorities to guide our decision making through the COVID-19 pandemic. These priorities are: • Supporting our associates on the front lines in terms of their physical safety, financial health and emotional well-being. We are providing extra pay and benefits, including special cash bonuses to associates and the introduction of a COVID-19 Emergency Leave Policy in the U.S. • Serving our customers as safely as possible and keeping our supply chain operating. We reduced our store operating hours at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and have expanded store hours slightly toward the end of the year. • Helping others which includes waiving or discounting rent for in-store tenants in April and May 2020 as well as hiring more than 500,000 new associates. • Managing the business well both operationally and financially and driving our long-term strategy. We are maintaining our everyday low-price discipline while investing in our omni-channel offering which continues to resonate with customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience. While we incurred incremental costs of $4.0 billion during fiscal 2021 associated with operating during a global health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in overall net sales growth during fiscal 2021 with strong comparable sales in the U.S. and the majority of our international markets. Sales trends were positively affected by eCommerce growth acceleration and we also saw customers consolidate shopping trips and purchase larger baskets. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the duration and extent of economic stimulus; timing and effectiveness of global vaccines; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which may impact our results. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. 34 Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expanding omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. Calendar comparable sales, including the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2021 and 2020, were as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2021 2020 2021 2020 With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 8.7% 2.9% (0.2)% 0.0% Sam's Club 8.7% 1.6% (3.4)% 0.8% Total U.S. 8.7% 2.7% (0.6)% 0.1% Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 8.7% and 2.7% in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. comparable sales increased 8.7% and 2.9% in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. For fiscal 2021, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a decline in transactions as customers consolidated shopping trips. For fiscal 2020, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket and transactions. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 5.4% and 2.1% to comparable sales for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. Sam's Club comparable sales increased 8.7% and 1.6% in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. For fiscal 2021, Sam's Club comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club comparable sales for fiscal 2020 benefited from growth in transactions and higher fuel sales, which were partially offset by lower average ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% and 1.8% to comparable sales for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 Net sales $ 555,233 $ 519,926 Percentage change from comparable period 6.8 % 1.9 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 116,288 $ 108,791 Percentage change from comparable period 6.9 % 1.5 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 20.9 % 20.9 % For fiscal 2021, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was flat when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from strong growth in comparable sales and lapping the $0.9 billion business restructuring charges from the prior year described below. These benefits were offset by $4.0 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points compared to the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales. These improvements were partially offset by $0.9 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, and other business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments. 35 Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As such, we are allocating more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings. Total fiscal 2021 capital expenditures decreased slightly compared to the prior year. The following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Fiscal Years Ended January 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2021 2020 eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other $ 5,681 $ 5,643 Remodels 2,013 2,184 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 134 77 Total U.S. $ 7,828 $ 7,904 Walmart International 2,436 2,801 Total capital expenditures $ 10,264 $ 10,705 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.6% and 6.7% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the losses on certain international operations held for sale or sold, partially offset by the fair value change in our equity investments as well as the increase in operating income. ROI was 14.0% and 13.4% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in ROI was primarily due to the increase in operating income. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. For fiscal 2020, lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of that balance sheet date, rather than averaged, because they are not directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8. A two-point average was used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases ( Topic 842) (""ASU 2016-02"") . Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. 36 The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 13,706 $ 15,201 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 244,496 $ 227,895 Return on assets (ROA) 5.6 % 6.7 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 22,548 $ 20,568 + Interest income 121 189 + Depreciation and amortization 11,152 10,987 + Rent 2,626 2,670 ROI operating income $ 36,447 $ 34,414 Denominator Average total assets (1), (2) $ 244,496 $ 235,277 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1), (2) 94,351 90,351 - Average accounts payable (1) 48,057 47,017 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 30,131 22,228 Average invested capital $ 260,659 $ 256,383 Return on investment (ROI) 14.0 % 13.4 % As of January 31, 2021 2020 2019 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 252,496 $ 236,495 $ 219,295 Leased assets, net NP 21,841 7,078 Total assets without leased assets, net NP 214,654 212,217 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 94,187 94,514 87,175 Accumulated amortization on leased assets NP 4,694 5,682 Accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets NP 89,820 81,493 Accounts payable 49,141 46,973 47,060 Accrued liabilities 37,966 22,296 22,159 (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the corresponding prior period and dividing by 2. Average total assets as used in ROA includes the average impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 . (2) For fiscal 2020, as a result of adopting ASU 2016-02, average total assets is based on the average of total assets without leased assets, net plus leased assets, net as of January 31, 2020. Average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets plus accumulated amortization on leased assets as of January 31, 2020. NP = Not provided. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See "" Liquidity and Capital Resources "" for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $36.1 billion, $25.3 billion and $27.8 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $25.8 billion, $14.6 billion and $17.4 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021 increased when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2021 increased when compared to fiscal 2020 due to the same reasons as the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in decreased capital expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the contribution to the Asda pension plan in anticipation of its 37 future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart operations, and the timing of vendor payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in increased capital expenditures. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 36,074 $ 25,255 $ 27,753 Payments for property and equipment (10,264) (10,705) (10,344) Free cash flow $ 25,810 $ 14,550 $ 17,409 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (10,071) $ (9,128) $ (24,036) Net cash used in financing activities (16,117) (14,299) (2,537) (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 2019 Total revenues $ 559,151 $ 523,964 $ 514,405 Percentage change from comparable period 6.7 % 1.9 % 2.8 % Net sales $ 555,233 $ 519,926 $ 510,329 Percentage change from comparable period 6.8 % 1.9 % 2.9 % Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 8.7 % 2.7 % 4.0 % Gross profit rate 24.3 % 24.1 % 24.5 % Operating income $ 22,548 $ 20,568 $ 21,957 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.1 % 4.0 % 4.3 % Consolidated net income $ 13,706 $ 15,201 $ 7,179 Unit counts at period end (1) 11,443 11,501 11,361 Retail square feet at period end (1) 1,121 1,129 1,129 (1) Unit counts and associated retail square feet are presented for stores and clubs generally open as of period end, and includes stores associated with operations classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021. Permanently closed locations are not included. Our total revenues, which includes net sales and membership and other income, increased $35.2 billion or 6.7% and $9.6 billion or 1.9% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenues were due to increases in net sales, which increased $35.3 billion or 6.8% and $9.6 billion or 1.9% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments as well as positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets resulting from increased demand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall net sales growth was strong despite certain operating limitations in several international markets in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The net sales increase was partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion. For fiscal 2020, net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with the addition of net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in August 2018, and positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets. These increases were partially offset by $4.1 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2020 and our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018. Our gross profit rate increased 20 basis points and decreased 40 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to strategic sourcing initiatives, strong sales in higher margin categories, and fewer markdowns. This was partially offset in the Walmart U.S. segment by carryover of prior year price investment as well as the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers in response to the 38 COVID-19 pandemic. For fiscal 2020, the decrease was primarily due to price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment and the addition of Flipkart in the Walmart International segment, partially offset by favorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. For fiscal 2021, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was flat when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from strong growth in comparable sales and lapping the $0.9 billion business restructuring charges from the prior year described below. These benefits were offset by $4.0 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year, due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales. These improvements were partially offset by $0.9 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, and other business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments. Other gains and losses consisted of net gains of $0.2 billion and $2.0 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The gain in fiscal 2021 primarily reflects $8.7 billion in net gains associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, partially offset by the $8.3 billion pre-tax loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021. The gain in fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of a $1.9 billion increase in the market value of our investment in JD.com. Our effective income tax rate was 33.3% for fiscal 2021, 24.4% for fiscal 2020, and 37.4% for fiscal 2019. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for or sold in fiscal 2021, which provided minimal realizable tax benefit. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the fiscal 2019 loss on sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which increased the previous comparative fiscal year's effective tax rate, as it provided minimal realizable tax benefit. Our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 is presented in Note 9 . As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $13.7 billion and $15.2 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, which represents a decrease of $1.5 billion and an increase of $8.0 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart (""EPS"") was $4.75, $5.19 and $2.26 for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Walmart U.S. Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 2019 Net sales $ 369,963 $ 341,004 $ 331,666 Percentage change from comparable period 8.5 % 2.8 % 4.1 % Calendar comparable sales increase 8.7 % 2.9 % 3.7 % Operating income $ 19,116 $ 17,380 $ 17,386 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.2 % 5.1 % 5.2 % Unit counts at period end 4,743 4,756 4,769 Retail square feet at period end 703 703 705 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $29.0 billion or 8.5% and $9.3 billion or 2.8% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable sales of 8.7% and 2.9% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Comparable sales in fiscal 2021 were driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from meeting the increased demand due to economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips. Comparable sales in fiscal 2020 were driven by both average ticket and transaction growth for fiscal 2020. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 5.4% and 2.1% to comparable sales for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. Gross profit rate was flat and decreased 14 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. While fiscal 2021 gross profit rate was flat, it benefited from strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns, offset by a change in merchandise mix, the carryover effect of prior year price investment and the temporary closure of our Auto Care and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For fiscal 2020, the decrease was primarily the result of continued price investments which were partially offset by better merchandise mix, including strength in private brands, and less pressure from transportation costs. 39 Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 15 and 4 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. We leveraged operating expenses in fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of strong sales, which were partially offset by $3.2 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic including special bonuses, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, costs associated with outfitting our stores and associates with masks, gloves and sanitizer, and expanded cleaning practices. Fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was also slightly aided by lapping the $0.5 billion business restructuring charges from the prior year described below, offset by a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 resulting from changes to Walmart U.S. support teams to better support its omni-channel strategy. The decrease in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to strong sales and productivity improvements which were mostly offset by business restructuring charges of $0.5 billion consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charges due to decisions that resulted in the write down of certain eCommerce assets. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $1.7 billion and decreased $6 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 2019 Net sales $ 121,360 $ 120,130 $ 120,824 Percentage change from comparable period 1.0 % (0.6) % 2.3 % Operating income $ 3,660 $ 3,370 $ 4,883 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.0 % 2.8 % 4.0 % Unit counts at period end 6,101 6,146 5,993 Retail square feet at period end 337 345 344 Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $1.2 billion or 1.0% and decreased $0.7 billion or 0.6% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion. The pandemic led to significant economic pressures and channel and mix shifts due to changes in consumer behavior, including accelerated growth in eCommerce in several markets. While several of our markets experienced extensive store and operational closures in the second quarter as a result of government mandates, most closed stores and warehouses had resumed operations by the third quarter. For fiscal 2020, the decrease was primarily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.1 billion as well as a reduction in sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018, offset by a full year of net sales from Flipkart and positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets. Gross profit rate increased 50 basis points and decreased 136 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to Flipkart's improved margin mix and reduced fuel sales in the U.K. For fiscal 2020, the decrease was primarily due to Flipkart, as well as a change in merchandise mix. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 14 basis points and decreased 13 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to $0.5 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and lapping the impairment charges in the prior year discussed below. Fiscal 2020 decreased primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets as well as cost discipline across multiple markets, partially offset by $0.4 billion in impairment charges primarily due to the write-off of the carrying value of one of Flipkart's two fashion trade names, Jabong.com, as a result of a strategic decision to focus our efforts on a single fashion platform in order to simplify the business and customer proposition. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.3 billion and decreased $1.5 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. 40 Sam's Club Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 2019 Including Fuel Net sales $ 63,910 $ 58,792 $ 57,839 Percentage change from comparable period 8.7 % 1.6 % (2.3) % Calendar comparable sales increase 8.7 % 1.6 % 5.4 % Operating income $ 1,906 $ 1,642 $ 1,520 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.0 % 2.8 % 2.6 % Unit counts at period end 599 599 599 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 59,184 $ 52,792 $ 52,332 Percentage change from comparable period 12.1 % 0.9 % (3.9) % Operating income $ 1,645 $ 1,486 $ 1,383 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.8 % 2.8 % 2.6 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $5.1 billion or 8.7% and $1.0 billion or 1.6% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Our 8.7% growth in comparable sales for fiscal 2021 benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2020, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 1.6%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and higher fuel sales, which were partially offset by lower ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.8% to comparable sales. Gross profit rate increased 65 basis points and decreased 11 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in gross profit rate was due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. For fiscal 2020 , gross profit rate decreased due to price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. Membership and other income increased 6.8% and 4.7% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2021 and 2020, the increases were primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates, and higher Plus Member penetration. Fiscal 2021 growth was also positively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Fiscal 2020 was also benefited by gains on property sales and other income. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 42 and decreased 19 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Despite increased net sales from the strong demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales. For fiscal 2020, the decrease was primarily the result of lower labor-related costs and a charge of approximately $50 million related to lease exit costs in the prior comparable period. These benefits were partially offset by a reduction in sales of tobacco and a higher level of technology investment. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.3 billion and $0.1 billion for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. 41 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 36,074 $ 25,255 $ 27,753 Net cash provided by operating activities was $36.1 billion, $25.3 billion and $27.8 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021 increased when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to the contribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart operations, and the timing of vendor payments. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $17.7 billion and $9.5 billion as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We maintained more cash at January 31, 2021 compared to January 31, 2020 in order to provide us with enhanced financial flexibility due to the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our working capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $2.6 billion and $16.0 billion as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in working capital deficit as compared to the previous fiscal year is primarily driven by the increase in cash and cash equivalents as well as the increase in current assets and current liabilities due to the classification of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan as held for sale. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. While we are awaiting anticipated technical guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") and the U.S. Treasury Department, we do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial position or results of operations. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, cash and cash equivalents of $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.8 billion as of January 31, 2021, approximately $1.0 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Net cash used in investing activities $ (10,071) $ (9,128) $ (24,036) Net cash used in investing activities was $10.1 billion, $9.1 billion and $24.0 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and generally consisted of payments for business acquisitions and to expand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other technologies and supply chain, remodel existing stores and clubs and add new stores and clubs. Net cash used in investing activities increased $0.9 billion for fiscal 2021 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as a result of lapping the net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in Walmart Canada and the change in other investing activities, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $14.9 billion for fiscal 2020 when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily as a result of the $13.8 billion payment for the acquisition of Flipkart, net of cash acquired, as well as payments for other, smaller acquisitions in fiscal 2019. 42 Additionally, refer to the "" Strategic Capital Allocation "" section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2021 and 2020. Growth Activities For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022""), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $14 billion, with a focus on supply chain, automation, customer-facing initiatives and technology. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Net cash used in financing activities $ (16,117) $ (14,299) $ (2,537) Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Fiscal 2021 net cash used in financing activities increased $1.8 billion when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to the timing of issuances and repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by both a reduction in cash used to pay down short-term borrowings as well as share repurchases as we manage our financial position during the current economic environment. Fiscal 2020 net cash used in financing activities increased $11.8 billion for fiscal 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the $15.9 billion of net proceeds received in fiscal 2019 from the issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart partially offset by $5.5 billion of additional long-term debt in the fiscal 2020 to fund general business operations. Short-term Borrowings We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end $ 4,048 $ 13,315 $ 13,389 Average daily short-term borrowings 1,577 7,120 10,625 Annual weighted-average interest rate 3.1 % 2.5 % 2.4 % We also have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. as of January 31, 2021 that provide additional liquidity, if needed. Additionally, we maintain access to various credit facilities outside of the U.S. to further support our Walmart International segment operations, as needed. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2021: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2020 $ 5,362 $ 43,714 $ 49,076 Repayments of long-term debt (5,382) — (5,382) Reclassifications of long-term debt 3,126 (3,126) — Other 9 606 615 Balances as of January 31, 2021 $ 3,115 $ 41,194 $ 44,309 Dividends Our total dividend payments were $6.1 billion, $6.0 billion and $6.1 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Board of Directors approved, effective February 18, 2021, the fiscal 2022 annual dividend of $2.20 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2021 annual dividend of $2.16 per share. For fiscal 2022, the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.55 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 19, 2021 April 5, 2021 May 7, 2021 June 1, 2021 August 13, 2021 September 7, 2021 December 10, 2021 January 3, 2022 43 Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal 2021 were made under the $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, of which authorization for $3.0 billion of share repurchases remained as of January 31, 2021. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which, beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 2019 Total number of shares repurchased 19.4 53.9 79.5 Average price paid per share $ 135.20 $ 105.98 $ 93.18 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 2,625 $ 5,717 $ 7,410 Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2021, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. 44 Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and certain contingent commitments as of January 31, 2021: Payments Due During Fiscal Years Ending January 31, (Amounts in millions) Total 2022 2023-2024 2025-2026 Thereafter Recorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt (1) $ 44,309 $ 3,115 $ 7,735 $ 5,840 $ 27,619 Short-term borrowings 224 224 — — — Operating lease obligations (2) 20,949 2,189 3,878 3,224 11,658 Finance lease obligations and other (2)(3) 8,835 896 1,461 1,221 5,257 Obligations related to businesses held for sale (4) 8,081 564 1,034 899 5,584 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Estimated interest on long-term debt 21,124 1,636 3,072 2,678 13,738 Syndicated and other letters of credit 2,019 2,019 — — — Purchase obligations 15,004 7,017 5,562 1,495 930 Obligations related to businesses held for sale (4) 856 621 210 22 3 Total contractual obligations $ 121,401 $ 18,281 $ 22,952 $ 15,379 $ 64,789 (1) Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt. (2) Represents our contractual obligations to make future payments under non-cancelable operating leases and finance lease agreements, both of which are recorded on the balance sheet at their present value. Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding operating and finance leases. (3) Finance lease obligations and other includes contractual obligations under other financing obligations of $1.3 billion. (4) Includes obligations related to our operations in Japan and the United Kingdom which are classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021. Under the terms of the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion, adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. As of January 31, 2021, the indemnification liability was $0.6 billion and recorded in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2021, and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate debt. Additionally, we have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. as of January 31, 2021. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. For the purposes of the above table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the table above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. The expected timing for payment discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $1.7 billion of net unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities. The timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 45 Other Matters We discuss our ""Asda Equal Value Claims"" which includes certain existing employment claims against our recently divested United Kingdom subsidiary, Asda Group Limited, including certain risks arising therefrom, under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings"" in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also discuss the Opioids Litigation including certain risks arising therefrom, in "" Item 1A. Risk Factors "" under the caption ""Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks"" and under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings"" in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We also discuss various legal proceedings related to the Asda Equal Value Claims and Opioids Litigation in "" Item 3. Legal Proceedings "" herein under the caption ""Supplemental Information."" The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represent contingencies of the Company that may or may not result in the Company incurring a material liability upon their final resolution. Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates. Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. Inventories We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at first-in, first-out (""FIFO""). Impairment of Assets We evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. Impairment charges on assets held and used were immaterial in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2021 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment. In fiscal 2021, the Company's operations in Argentina, Japan and the United Kingdom met the held for sale criteria. As a result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, less costs to sell, which resulted in impairment charges that were included in the total estimated pre-tax loss of $8.3 billion recorded in fiscal 2021. Refer to Note 12 . Fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which included full impairment of all related assets. Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. 46 Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2021, our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have also historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. Due to certain strategic restructuring decisions, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion in impairment in fiscal 2020 related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software. Contingencies We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Taxes Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on estimates. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard–setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. 47 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2021, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased $69 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2021. Expected Maturity Date (Amounts in millions) Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2026 Thereafter Total Liabilities Short-term borrowings: Variable rate $ 224 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 224 Weighted-average interest rate 1.9 % — % — % — % — % — % 1.9 % Long-term debt (1) : Fixed rate $ 2,365 $ 3,014 $ 4,721 $ 4,360 $ 1,480 $ 27,619 $ 43,559 Weighted-average interest rate 3.8 % 1.7 % 3.1 % 2.7 % 3.6 % 4.5 % 3.9 % Variable rate $ 750 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 750 Weighted-average interest rate 0.5 % — % — % — % — % — % 0.5 % Interest rate derivatives Interest rate swaps: Fixed to variable $ — $ — $ 1,750 $ 1,500 $ — $ — $ 3,250 Weighted-average pay rate — % — % 0.6 % 1.3 % — % — % 0.9 % Weighted-average receive rate — % — % 2.6 % 3.3 % — % — % 2.9 % (1) Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt. As of January 31, 2021, our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 9% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2021 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $42 million. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S, as well as our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt. For fiscal 2021, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets resulted in the $0.2 billion net gain in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss. We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $83 million and $241 million as of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of certain currencies relative to the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2021. The hypothetical result of a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $524 million. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2021 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $46 million. 48 In addition to currency swaps, we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our foreign operations. We had outstanding long-term debt of £1.7 billion as of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in the U.K. As of January 31, 2021, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $210 million. In addition, we had outstanding long-term debt of ¥100 billion as of January 31, 2021 and ¥180 billion as of January 31, 2020 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in Japan. As of January 31, 2021, a hypothetical 10% change in value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $87 million. As of January 31, 2021, the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan are classified as held for sale, and subsequently closed in February 2021 and March 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies. Investment Risk We are exposed to changes in the stock price of our equity investments with readily determinable fair values. The change in fair value is recorded within other gains and losses and resulted in a gain of $8.7 billion in fiscal 2021 due to net increases in the stock price of those equity investments. As of January 31, 2021, the fair value of our equity investments with readily determinable fair values was $14.4 billion. As of January 31, 2021, a hypothetical 10% change in the stock price of such investments would have changed the fair value of such investments by approximately $1.4 billion. 49 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. For the Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021 Table of Contents Page Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 51 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 53 Consolidated Statements of Income 54 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 55 Consolidated Balance Sheets 56 Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity 57 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 58 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 59 50 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""Consolidated Financial Statements""). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Contingencies Description of the Matter As described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at January 31, 2021, the Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate. For some matters, a liability is not probable, or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. Where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. Management assessed the probability of occurrence and the estimation of any potential loss based on the ability to predict the number of claims that may be filed or whether any loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. For example, in assessing the probability of occurrence in a particular legal proceeding, management exercises judgment to determine if it can predict the number of claims that may be filed and whether it can reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from that proceeding. In connection with the sale of Asda, the Company is no longer liable for the Asda Equal Value Claims; however, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification for any potential Asda liability related to these claims up to a contractually determined amount. 51 Auditing management’s accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies and the estimated fair value of related indemnifications was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our assessment of the significant judgments made by management when assessing the probability of occurrence for contingencies or related indemnifications or when determining whether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and evaluation of contingencies and related indemnities. For example, we tested controls over the Company’s assessment of the likelihood of loss and the Company’s determinations regarding the measurement of loss. To test the Company’s assessment of the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, among other procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors, reviewed opinions provided to the Company by certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and external counsel, and evaluated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal legal counsel. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures. To test the estimated fair value of indemnities, we involved a valuation specialist to evaluate the valuation methodologies and significant assumptions including, among others, the discount rate. Valuation of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Description of the Matter At January 31, 2021, the Company has $4.9 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily consist of acquired tradenames. As disclosed in Notes 1, 8 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, these assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually using valuation techniques to estimate fair value. These fair value estimates are sensitive to certain significant assumptions including revenue growth rates, discount rates, and royalty rates. Auditing management’s annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant measurement uncertainty in determining the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangibles. For example, the fair value estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions identified above that are affected by future market or economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment review process. Our procedures included, among others, testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions described above used to estimate the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. To test the estimated fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies used to determine the fair value, testing the significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company. For example, we evaluated management’s forecasted revenue growth rates used in the fair value estimates by comparing those assumptions to the historical results of the Company and current industry, market and economic forecasts. We involved a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating the valuation methodologies and the significant assumptions such as discount rates and royalty rates. Additionally, we performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the effect on the fair value estimates of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 1969. Rogers, Arkansas March 19, 2021 52 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated March 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Rogers, Arkansas March 19, 2021 53 Walmart Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General Walmart Inc. (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers. The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021""), January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020"") and January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019""). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2021 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions, including potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $ 4.1 billion and $ 1.7 billion as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $ 17.7 billion and $ 9.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, approximately 40 % and 80 % were held outside of the U.S., respectively. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations. The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $ 2.8 billion and $ 2.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $ 2.8 billion as of January 31, 2021, approximately $ 1.0 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart"") minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Receivables Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which also includes insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales, banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. As of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, receivables from transactions with customers, net were $ 2.7 billion and $ 2.9 billion, respectively. 59 Inventories The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory for the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (""FIFO"") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. Held for Sale Components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale are presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. The Company reviews its businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values. As of January 31, 2021, $ 19.2 billion assets held for sale and $ 12.7 billion liabilities held for sale were classified in prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively, reflecting the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan classified as held for sale. Refer to Note 12 for additional details. As of January 31, 2020, assets and liabilities held for sale were immaterial. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances, and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis: As of January 31, (Amounts in millions) Estimated Useful Lives 2021 2020 Land N/A $ 19,308 $ 24,619 Buildings and improvements 3 - 40 years 97,582 105,674 Fixtures and equipment 1 - 30 years 56,639 58,607 Transportation equipment 3 - 15 years 2,301 2,377 Construction in progress N/A 4,741 3,751 Property and equipment 180,571 195,028 Accumulated depreciation ( 88,370 ) ( 89,820 ) Property and equipment, net $ 92,201 $ 105,208 Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and financing obligations, property under capital leases and intangible assets for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 11.2 billion, $ 11.0 billion and $ 10.7 billion, respectively. Leases For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company records right-of-use (""ROU"") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments. Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. 60 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2021, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill. The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2021 and 2020: (Amounts in millions) Walmart U.S. Walmart International Sam's Club Total Balances as of February 1, 2019 $ 2,552 $ 28,316 $ 313 $ 31,181 Changes in currency translation and other — ( 149 ) — ( 149 ) Acquisitions 41 — — 41 Balances as of January 31, 2020 2,593 28,167 313 31,073 Changes in currency translation and other — 10 — 10 Acquisitions 103 — 8 111 Amounts reclassified related to operations held for sale (1) — ( 2,211 ) — ( 2,211 ) Balances as of January 31, 2021 $ 2,696 $ 25,966 $ 321 $ 28,983 (1) Represents goodwill associated with operations in the U.K. and Japan which are classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021. Refer to Note 12 . Intangible assets are included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $ 4.9 billion and $ 5.2 billion, respectively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily consists of acquired trade names. Refer to Note 12 for additional information related to acquired intangible assets for the Flipkart acquisition in fiscal 2019. There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2020, the Company incurred approximately $ 0.7 billion in impairment charges related to its intangible assets. Refer to Note 8 for additional information. Fair Value Measurement The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Refer to Note 8 for more information. Additionally, the Company may provide routine indemnifications in connection with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, for which an indemnification liability equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation is recorded upon inception. Where necessary, these obligations are recorded at their fair value within deferred income taxes and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 61 Investments Investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value recognized in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 8 for details. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments recorded in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments in debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are reported at amortized cost in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with interest or dividend income recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Self Insurance Reserves The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits. Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability. Derivatives The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty. The Company enters into derivatives with counterparties rated only ""A-"" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The Company is subject to master netting arrangements which provides set-off and close out netting of exposures with counterparties, but the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s collateral arrangements require the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-determined thresholds, after considering the effects of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral. Cash collateral received under these arrangements was not significant as of January 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company was not required to provide any cash collateral to counterparties as of January 31, 2021 and 2020. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, derivative gains and losses are recorded through the same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings. Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 8 for the presentation of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities. Fair Value Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2023 to April 2024. Cash Flow Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The Company records changes in the fair value of these swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2022 to March 2034. 62 Net Investment Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with net investments of certain of its foreign operations. The Company records changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk in accumulated other comprehensive loss. These derivatives, which relate to the Company's operations in the United Kingdom held for sale as of January 31, 2021, have maturity dates ranging from October 2023 to February 2030. The Company also designated certain foreign currency denominated long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan, both of which were classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021. The Company records foreign currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $ 3.3 billion and $ 3.9 billion, respectively, of outstanding long-term debt designated as net investment hedges. These derivative and non-derivative gains or losses continue to defer in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the sale or substantial liquidation of these foreign operations. Refer to Note 12 for additional detail regarding the divestiture of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (""temporary differences""). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act"") contains a provision which subjects a U.S. parent of a foreign subsidiary to current U.S. tax on its global intangible low–taxed income (“GILTI”). The GILTI income is eligible for a deduction, which lowers the effective tax rate to 10.5 % for calendar years 2018 through 2025 and 13.125 % after 2025. The Company will report the tax impact of GILTI as a period cost when incurred. Accordingly, the Company is not providing deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI. In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures. Revenue Recognition Net Sales The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or services to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns. Membership Fee Revenue The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $ 1.7 billion for fiscal 2021, $ 1.5 billion for fiscal 2020 and $ 1.4 billion for fiscal 2019, respectively. Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 63 Gift Cards Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period. Financial and Other Services The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs. Payments from Suppliers The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold. Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In certain limited situations, reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific, incremental and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs were $ 3.2 billion, $ 3.7 billion and $ 3.5 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2020 with no material impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 64 Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 2019 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 13,706 $ 15,201 $ 7,179 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 196 ) ( 320 ) ( 509 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 13,510 $ 14,881 $ 6,670 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,831 2,850 2,929 Dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards 16 18 16 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,847 2,868 2,945 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 4.77 $ 5.22 $ 2.28 Diluted 4.75 5.19 2.26 Note 3. Shareholders' Equity The total authorized shares of $ 0.10 par value common stock is 11.0 billion, of which 2.8 billion were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2021 and 2020. Share-Based Compensation The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $ 1.2 billion, $ 0.9 billion and $ 0.8 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $ 0.3 billion, $ 0.2 billion and $ 0.2 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type for all plans: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Restricted stock units $ 742 $ 553 $ 456 Restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units 277 270 293 Other 150 31 24 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,169 $ 854 $ 773 The Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the ""Plan""), as subsequently amended and restated, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders. The Plan's award types are summarized as follows: • Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Beginning in fiscal 2020, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 25 % each year over a four year period from the date of the grant. Prior to fiscal 2020, 50 % of restricted stock units generally vested three years from the grant date and the remaining 50 % were vested five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 4.4 %, 4.9 % and 7.2 %, respectively. 65 • Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance-based restricted stock units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0 % to 150 % of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years . Restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 4.5 %, 5.1 % and 6.2 %, respectively. In addition to the Plan, Flipkart has certain share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to acquire Flipkart common shares may be issued. Share-based compensation expense associated with these plans is included in the Other line in the table above. The following table shows the activity for restricted stock units and restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units during fiscal 2021: Restricted Stock Units Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (Shares in thousands) Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share Outstanding as of February 1, 2020 23,261 $ 79.51 6,045 $ 93.04 Granted 7,472 114.51 2,867 120.47 Adjustment for performance achievement (1) — — 576 86.46 Vested/exercised ( 7,798 ) 76.11 ( 3,075 ) 88.88 Forfeited ( 3,035 ) 92.20 ( 1,000 ) 96.36 Outstanding as of January 31, 2021 19,900 $ 92.13 5,413 $ 108.72 (1) Represents the adjustment to previously granted performance share units for performance achievement.

All repurchases made during fiscal 2021 were made under the $ 20.0 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, of which authorization for $ 3.0 billion of share repurchases remained as of January 31, 2021. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $ 20.0 billion share repurchase program which, beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations and the market price of the Company's common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 2019 Total number of shares repurchased 19.4 53.9 79.5 Average price paid per share $ 135.20 $ 105.98 $ 93.18 Total cash paid for share repurchases $ 2,625 $ 5,717 $ 7,410 66 Note 4.

Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company measures the fair value of equity investments on a recurring basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the Company's equity investments with readily determinable fair values are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of January 31, 2021 Fair Value as of January 31, 2020 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 6,517 $ 2,715 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 7,905 2,723 Total $ 14,422 $ 5,438 70 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: January 31, 2021 January 31, 2020 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 3,250 $ 166 (1) $ 4,000 $ 97 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges 1,250 311 (1) 3,750 455 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 5,073 ( 394 ) (3) 4,067 ( 696 ) (2) Total $ 9,573 $ 83 $ 11,817 $ ( 144 ) (1) Classified in other long-term assets within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Classified in deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. (3) Approximately $ 456 million of cash flow hedges were classified in deferred income taxes and other and $ 62 million of cash flow were classified in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. As further discussed in Note 12 , the Company's operations in Argentina, Japan and the U.K. met the held for sale criteria in fiscal 2021. As a result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, less costs to sell, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement based on each transaction’s expected consideration. The carrying value of the Argentina, Japan and U.K. disposal groups exceeded their fair value, less costs to sell, and as a result, the Company recognized non-recurring impairment charges. The aggregate pre-tax loss of $ 8.3 billion associated with the divestiture of these operations in the Walmart International segment was recorded in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended January 31, 2021 and included these impairment charges as well as a $ 2.3 billion charge related to the Asda pension plan. These impairment charges include the anticipated release of non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses associated with the disposal groups. Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2021 were immaterial. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment charges related to assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis primarily related to the following: • in the Walmart U.S. segment, $ 0.5 billion in impairment charges for impaired assets consisting primarily of trade names and acquired developed software due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write-down of certain eCommerce assets; and • in the Walmart International segment, $ 0.4 billion in impairment charges consisting primarily of the write-off of the carrying value of one of Flipkart's two fashion trade names, Jabong.com, as a result of a strategic decision to focus on the Myntra.com fashion platform. These impairment charges were classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2020 were immaterial. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, the Company sold the majority stake in Walmart Brazil during fiscal 2019 as discussed in Note 12 . The assets of the disposal group totaled $ 3.3 billion and were comprised of $ 1.0 billion in current assets, $ 1.6 billion in property and equipment and property under capital lease and financing obligations, net, and $ 0.7 billion of other long-term assets. When measured as held for sale, these assets were fully impaired as the carrying value of the disposal group exceeded the fair value, less costs to sell and contributed to a pre-tax net loss of $ 4.8 billion in the Walmart International segment, which was recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. Other impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2019 were immaterial. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. 71 The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, are as follows: January 31, 2021 January 31, 2020 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 44,309 $ 54,240 $ 49,076 $ 57,769 Note 9. Taxes The components of income (loss) before income taxes are as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2019 U.S. $ 20,003 $ 17,098 $ 15,875 Non-U.S. 561 3,018 ( 4,415 ) Total income before income taxes $ 20,564 $ 20,116 $ 11,460 A summary of the provision for income taxes is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Current: U.S. federal $ 2,991 $ 2,794 $ 2,763 U.S. state and local 742 587 493 International 1,127 1,205 1,495 Total current tax provision 4,860 4,586 4,751 Deferred: U.S. federal 2,316 663 ( 361 ) U.S. state and local 23 35 ( 16 ) International ( 341 ) ( 369 ) ( 93 ) Total deferred tax expense (benefit) 1,998 329 ( 470 ) Total provision for income taxes $ 6,858 $ 4,915 $ 4,281 In December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and significantly changed U.S. income tax law. Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate and created new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI""). In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""SAB 118""), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Management completed the Company's accounting for tax reform in fiscal 2019 based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. In fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $ 442 million of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for income taxes. One-time Transition Tax The Tax Act required the Company to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5 % to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0 % on the remaining earnings. The Company calculated the transition tax liability and increased the provisional amount by $ 413 million, with the increase included as a component of provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019. 72 Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing operations is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2021 2020 2019 U.S. statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % U.S. state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 2.9 % 2.2 % 3.0 % Impact of the Tax Act: One-time transition tax — % — % 3.6 % Deferred tax effects — % — % ( 0.7 ) % Income taxed outside the U.S. ( 0.1 ) % ( 1.0 ) % ( 3.4 ) % Disposal and wind-down of certain business operations 7.1 % — % 6.7 % Valuation allowance 2.3 % 2.3 % 6.3 % Net impact of repatriated international earnings ( 0.4 ) % 0.4 % 0.8 % Federal tax credits ( 0.9 ) % ( 0.8 ) % ( 1.3 ) % Enacted change in tax laws — % ( 1.9 ) % — % Change in reserve for tax contingencies 0.8 % 2.5 % 0.6 % Other, net 0.6 % ( 0.3 ) % 0.8 % Effective income tax rate 33.3 % 24.4 % 37.4 % The following sections regarding deferred taxes, unremitted earnings, net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards, valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions exclude amounts related to operations classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021. Deferred Taxes The significant components of the Company's deferred tax account balances are as follows: January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets: Loss and tax credit carryforwards $ 9,179 $ 9,056 Accrued liabilities 2,582 2,483 Share-based compensation 224 250 Lease obligations 4,450 4,098 Other 589 887 Total deferred tax assets 17,024 16,774 Valuation allowances ( 8,782 ) ( 8,588 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 8,242 8,186 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment 4,802 4,364 Acquired intangibles 1,071 1,153 Inventory 1,235 1,414 Lease right of use assets 4,390 3,998 Mark-to-market investments 2,678 723 Other 675 824 Total deferred tax liabilities 14,851 12,476 Net deferred tax liabilities $ 6,609 $ 4,290 The deferred taxes noted above are classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Balance Sheet classification Assets: Other long-term assets $ 1,836 $ 1,914 Liabilities: Deferred income taxes and other 8,445 6,204 Net deferred tax liabilities $ 6,609 $ 4,290 73 Unremitted Earnings Prior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings, and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. As of January 31, 2021, the Company has not recorded approximately $ 2 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation. Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances As of January 31, 2021, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $ 38.4 billion. Of these carryforwards, approximately $ 26.4 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2041. The remaining carryforwards have no expiration. The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To the extent that a valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company had valuation allowances of $ 8.8 billion and $ 8.6 billion as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with the net operating loss carryforwards. Activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2021 related to valuation allowance builds in multiple markets, as well as releases due to the expiration of underlying deferred tax assets. Uncertain Tax Positions The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. As of January 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $ 3.1 billion and $ 1.8 billion, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.6 billion as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 1,817 $ 1,305 $ 1,010 Increases related to prior year tax positions 92 516 620 Decreases related to prior year tax positions ( 264 ) ( 15 ) ( 107 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 1,582 66 203 Settlements during the period ( 64 ) ( 29 ) ( 390 ) Lapse in statutes of limitations ( 28 ) ( 26 ) ( 31 ) Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 3,135 $ 1,817 $ 1,305 The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. Interest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as expeditiously as possible. As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months. The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2014, and 2018 through 2021. The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2013 through 2021, and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2013 through 2021. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2012. 74 Other Taxes The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 10. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Asda Equal Value Claims Asda, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company which was sold in February 2021, is a defendant in over 40,000 ""equal value"" claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the ""Employment Tribunal"") in the United Kingdom (""U.K."") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. Asda appealed the ruling and is awaiting a decision from the Supreme Court of the U.K. Notwithstanding the appeal, claimants are now proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. Following the sale of Asda described in Note 12 , the Company will continue to conduct the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to these claims up to a contractually determined amount. Opioids Litigation In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”). The Company’s action was dismissed and the Company is appealing the decision. On December 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled 75 substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the CSA. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company’s disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. A derivative action was also filed by one of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company’s distribution and dispensing of opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from the various Opioids Litigation and intends to vigorously defend these litigation matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Note 11. Retirement-Related Benefits The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches 100 % of participant contributions up to 6 % of annual eligible earnings. The matching contributions immediately vest at 100 % for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50 % of their pre-tax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits. Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established. The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Defined contribution plans: U.S. $ 1,290 $ 1,184 $ 1,165 International 200 177 126 Total contribution expense for defined contribution plans $ 1,490 $ 1,361 $ 1,291 Additionally, the Company's subsidiary in the United Kingdom has a sponsored defined benefit pension plan. In October 2019, Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the ""Plan"") entered into an agreement pursuant to which Asda made a cash contribution of $ 1.0 billion to the Plan (the ""Asda Pension Contribution"") which enabled the Plan to purchase a bulk annuity insurance contract for the benefit of Plan participants. The agreement between Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Plan contemplates that subsequent to the purchase of the bulk annuity insurance contract by the Plan, each of the Plan participants will be issued an individual annuity contract. The issuer of the individual annuity insurance contracts will be solely responsible for paying each participant’s benefits in full and will release the Plan and Asda from any future obligations. In connection with the sale of Asda, all accumulated pension components of $ 2.3 billion were included in the disposal group and the estimated pre-tax loss recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as discussed in Note 8 and Note 12 . 76 Note 12. Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items The following disposals and acquisitions impact the Company's Walmart International segment. Walmart Argentina In November 2020, the Company completed the sale of Walmart Argentina. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $ 1.0 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income primarily due to the impact of cumulative translation losses on the carrying value of the disposal group. Asda In October 2020, the Company agreed to sell Asda, the Company’s retail operations in the U.K., for net consideration of $ 9.4 billion, which was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain legal and tax matters and will retain an investment in Asda that will be accounted for as a debt security. As a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $ 5.5 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by approximately $ 0.8 billion related to the estimated fair value of certain indemnities and other transaction related costs. The Company completed the sale in February 2021, and will deconsolidate the financial statements of Asda in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and begin recognizing immaterial interest income related to its debt security. In October 2019, Asda, Walmart, and the Trustee of the Plan entered into an agreement which provides for the issuance of individual annuity contracts to each Plan participant and will release the Plan and Asda from any future obligations. Upon classifying the Asda disposal group as held for sale, $ 2.3 billion of accumulated pension components associated with the expected derecognition of the Asda pension plan were included as part of the loss mentioned above, which will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss upon completion of the sale in February 2021. Seiyu In November 2020, the Company agreed to sell Seiyu, the Company's retail operations in Japan, for net consideration of $ 1.2 billion, which was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021. As a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $ 1.9 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The sale was completed in March 2021 and the Company will deconsolidate the financial statements of Seiyu in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and account for its retained 15 percent ownership interest as an equity investment. Assets and liabilities held for sale associated with the Asda and Seiyu disposal groups as of January 31, 2021 were as follows: January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,848 Other current assets (1) 2,545 Property and equipment, net 13,193 Operating lease right-of-use assets 4,360 Finance lease right-of-use assets, net 1,395 Goodwill 2,211 Other long-term assets 1,063 Valuation allowance against assets held for sale (2) ( 7,420 ) Total assets held for sale $ 19,195 Current liabilities (3) 6,535 Operating lease obligations, including amounts due within one year 4,245 Finance lease obligations, including amounts due within one year 1,495 Deferred income taxes and other 459 Total liabilities held for sale $ 12,734 (1) Includes inventories, receivables, net and prepaid expenses and other. (2) Includes the $ 2.3 billion loss associated with the derecognition of the Asda pension plan and $ 1.3 billion cumulative foreign currency and related net investment hedge and other impacts included within the disposal groups, which will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss upon closure of each transaction. (3) Includes accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 77 Walmart Brazil In August 2018, the Company sold an 80 percent stake of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (""Advent""). Under the terms of the sale, Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax net loss of $ 4.8 billion during fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. Substantially all of this charge was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 upon meeting the held for sale criteria. In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by $ 0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the indemnity, the Company will indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$ 2.3 billion, adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. The Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. This equity method investment was determined to have no fair value and continues to have no carrying value. Flipkart In August 2018, the Company acquired 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an eCommerce marketplace in India, for cash consideration of approximately $ 16 billion. The acquisition increases the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company finalized the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Flipkart acquisition as follows: • Assets of $ 24.1 billion, which comprise primarily of $ 2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $ 2.8 billion in other current assets, $ 5.0 billion in intangible assets and $ 13.5 billion in goodwill. Of the intangible assets, $ 4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The remaining $ 0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily relate to acquired technology with a life of 3 years. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale primarily related to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes; • Liabilities of $ 3.7 billion, which comprise primarily of $ 1.8 billion of current liabilities and $ 1.7 billion of deferred income taxes; and • Noncontrolling interest of $ 4.3 billion, for which the fair value was estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The Company began consolidating the financial statements of Flipkart in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, using a one-month lag. To finance the acquisition, the Company used a combination of cash provided by long-term debt as discussed in Note 6 and cash on hand. The Flipkart results of operations since acquisition and the pro forma financial information are immaterial. Note 13. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company also engaged in operations in Japan and the United Kingdom, both of which were classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2021, and subsequently sold in February 2021 and March 2021, respectively. The Company also operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in November 2020 and in Brazil prior to sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of recent divestitures. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly 78 reviewed by its CODM. Beginning with the first quarter in fiscal 2021, the Company revised its definition of eCommerce net sales to include certain pharmacy transactions, and accordingly, revised prior period amounts to maintain comparability.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (""COSO"") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2021. The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report which appears herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

BUSINESS General Walmart Inc. (""Walmart,"" the ""Company"" or ""we"") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve over 265 million customers who visit approximately 11,500 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 56 banners in 27 countries. Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (""EDLP""). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost (""EDLC"") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020 ""), January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019 "") and January 31, 2018 (""fiscal 2018 ""). During fiscal 2020 , we generated total revenues of $524.0 billion , which primarily comprised net sales of $519.9 billion . We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""WMT."" The Development of Our Company Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expanded and, as of January 31, 2020 , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 26 countries. In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating walmart.com and then later that year, adding samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. Since 2016, we have made several eCommerce acquisitions which have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, as well as incubate digitally-native brands and expand our assortment on walmart.com and in stores. In fiscal 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping and we created Store N o 8, a technology incubator with a focus to drive eCommerce innovation. Then in fiscal 2019, we continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives with the acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart""), an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace , with an ecosystem that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform. In fiscal 2020, we launched NextDay Delivery to more than 75 percent of the U.S. population, launched Delivery Unlimited from 1,600 locations in the U.S. and expanded Same Day Pickup to nearly 3,200 locations. Our eCommerce efforts and innovation have also led to omni-channel offerings in many of our markets including grocery pick up and/or delivery in nearly a dozen countries outside the U.S. To date, we now have more than 6,100 grocery pick up and delivery locations globally. We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, services, eCommerce sites, supply chain combined with our more than 2.2 million associates to better serve our customers. Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates customer relationships where customers view Walmart as their primary destination. 7 Information About Our Segments We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. We define our segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We sell similar individual products and services in each of our segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. We measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Walmart U.S. Segment Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the ""Walmart"" and ""Walmart Neighborhood Market"" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $341.0 billion for fiscal 2020 , representing 66% of our fiscal 2020 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $331.7 billion and $318.5 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate""). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. Omni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce , through services such as ""Same Day Pickup,"" ""Same Day Delivery,"" ""Delivery Unlimited,"" ""NextDay Delivery,"" and ""Endless Aisle."" As of January 31, 2020 , we had nearly 3,200 grocery pickup locations and over 1,600 delivery locations. We have several eCommerce websites, the largest of which is walmart.com. We define eCommerce sales as sales initiated online through our websites or through a mobile app. eCommerce sales may be fulfilled by a number of methods including our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers or our stores. The following table provides the approximate size of our retail stores as of January 31, 2020 : Minimum Square Feet Maximum Square Feet Average Square Feet Supercenters (general merchandise and grocery) 69,000 260,000 178,000 Discount stores (general merchandise and limited grocery) 30,000 206,000 105,000 Neighborhood markets (1) (grocery) 28,000 65,000 42,000 (1) Excludes other small formats. Merchandise. Walmart U.S. does business in three strategic merchandise units, listed below: • Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including meat, produce, natural & organics, deli & bakery, dairy, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral and dry grocery, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, baby products, household chemicals, paper goods and pet supplies; • Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical services, clinical services, and over-the-counter drugs and other medical products; • General merchandise includes: ◦ Entertainment (e.g., electronics, cameras and supplies, photo processing services, wireless, movies, music, video games and books); ◦ Hardlines (e.g., stationery, automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and horticulture); ◦ Apparel (e.g., apparel for women, girls, men, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and ◦ Home/Seasonal (e.g., home furnishings, housewares and small appliances, bedding, home decor, toys, fabrics and crafts and seasonal merchandise). Walmart U.S. recently launched Walmart Media Group, an in-house advertising offering, to work with brands to influence shoppers. Walmart U.S. also offers fuel and financial services and related products, including money orders, prepaid cards, money (wire) transfers, check cashing and bill payment. Combined, these offerings total less than 1% of annual net sales. 8 Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private-label brands, including brands such as: ""Allswell,"" ""Athletic Works,"" ""Bonobos,"" ""Equate,"" ""EV1,"" ""Everstart,"" ""George,"" ""Great Value,"" ""Holiday Time,"" ""Mainstays,"" ""Marketside,"" ""No Boundaries,"" ""Onn,"" ""Ozark Trail,"" ""Parent's Choice,"" ""Scoop,"" ""SwissTech,"" ""Time and Tru"" and ""Wonder Nation."" The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: ""Better Homes & Gardens,"" ""Farberware"" and ""Russell."" Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability. Operations. Many supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets are open 24 hours each day. A variety of payment methods are accepted. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools that help better serve customers and be more efficient in stores, such as shelf-scanning robots, autonomous floor scrubbers, and automated unloading conveyor systems. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, as well as eCommerce retailers. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following: • EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity; • EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; and • Omni-channel offerings such as Same Day Pickup and Same Day Delivery, where a customer places an order online and picks it up for free from a store or has it delivered; Delivery Unlimited, where a customer can receive unlimited grocery delivery for an annual fee; as well as free two-day shipping without an annual membership fee and free NextDay Delivery on an assortment of best-selling items. Distribution. For fiscal 2020 , approximately 79% of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through our 162 distribution facilities, which are located strategically throughout the U.S. The remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 40 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers which includes eight temporary fulfillment centers. Walmart International Segment Walmart International is our second largest segment and operates in 26 countries outside of the U.S. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom, and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua), India and Mexico. Walmart International previously operated in Brazil prior to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019, as discussed in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, asda.com, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $120.1 billion for fiscal 2020 , representing 23% of our fiscal 2020 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $ 120.8 billion and $118.1 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The segment's net sales were negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. 9 Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including: • Acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018. • Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (“Advent”) in August 2018. • Divestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the divestiture of the Walmart Canada banking operations in April 2019. Omni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce , such as through services like ""Click & Collect"" in the United Kingdom, our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets, our marketplaces, such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India. Generally, retail units' selling area range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling area generally range in size from 25,000 square feet to 156,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2020 , Walmart International had nearly 3,200 grocery pickup and/or delivery locations across its markets. Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as ""Equate,"" ""George,"" ""Great Value,"" ""Holiday Time,"" ""Mainstays,"" ""Marketside"" and ""Parent's Choice,"" our international markets have developed market specific brands including ""Aurrera,"" ""Cambridge,"" ""Lider,"" ""Myntra,"" ""PhonePe"" and ""Extra Special."" In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Competition. Walmart International competes with omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. Distribution. We utilize a total of 221 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Certain of these facilities are used to ship merchandise to both our stores and customers on our eCommerce platforms. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2020 , approximately 85% of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 88 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as more than 2,500 eCommerce sort centers in India. Sam's Club Segment Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club had net sales of $58.8 billion for fiscal 2020 , representing 11% of our consolidated fiscal 2020 net sales, and had net sales of $ 57.8 billion and $59.2 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. 10 Membership. The following two options are available to members: Plus Membership Club Membership Annual Membership Fee $100 $45 Number of Add-on Memberships ($40 each) Up to 16 Up to 8 Eligible for Cash Rewards Yes No All memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost. Plus Members are eligible for Cash Rewards, which is a benefit that provides 2% back on qualifying Sam's Club purchases up to a $500 cash reward annually. The amount earned can be used for purchases, membership fees or redeemed for cash. Plus Members are also eligible for Free Shipping on the majority of merchandise, with no minimum order size, and receive discounts on prescriptions and glasses. Omni-channel. While Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club, it provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce . The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 32,000 and 168,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet. Members have access to a broad assortment of merchandise, including products not found in our clubs, and services online at samsclub.com and through our mobile commerce applications, providing services such as ""Club Pickup"" or the option of delivery direct-to-home. Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories: • Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items; • Fuel, tobacco and other categories consists of gasoline stations, tobacco, tools and power equipment, and tire and battery centers; • Home and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, grills, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, housewares, toys, seasonal items, mattresses and small appliances; • Technology, office and entertainment includes electronics, wireless, software, video games, movies, books, music, office supplies, office furniture, photo processing and third-party gift cards; and • Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services and over-the-counter drugs. In addition, the Member's Mark private label brand continues to expand assortment and deliver member value. Operations. Operating hours for Sam's Clubs are generally Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, most club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m. A variety of payment methods are accepted. Consistent with its strategy, Sam's Club continues to develop technology tools to drive a great member experience in club. For example, Sam's Garage, a new application in its tire and battery business, is leveraging technology in new ways to provide a personalized and efficient shopping experience. Sam's Club also offers ""Scan and Go,"" a mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete. Distribution. During fiscal 2020 , approximately 73% of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from Sam's Club's 25 dedicated distribution facilities, located strategically throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's club purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from Clubs, nine dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, two dedicated import facilities and other distribution centers. 11 Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties. Suppliers and Supply Chain As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the U.S., from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the ""fresh"" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of the annual sales for a number of our suppliers, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members. Employees As of the end of fiscal 2020 , Walmart Inc. and our subsidiaries employed more than 2.2 million employees (""associates"") worldwide, with 1.5 million associates in the U.S. and 0.7 million associates internationally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates. We believe our relationships with our associates are good. A large number of associates turn over each year, although Walmart U.S. turnover has improved in recent years as a result of our focus on increasing wages and providing improved tools, technology and training to associates. Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S. we offer a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates. These include a store discount card or Sam's Club membership, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of associate purchases of our stock through our Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance. In addition to the health-care benefits for eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S., we offer maternity leave and a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates. We also offer a $5,000 benefit to assist eligible associates with adoption. Additionally, we offer eligible associates tuition assistance towards earning a college degree through ""Live Better U,"" which allows associates to earn a college degree or certificate for the equivalent of $1 per day. Similarly, in our operations outside the U.S., we provide a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements. 12 Information About Our Executive Officers The following chart names the executive officers of the Company as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, each of whom is elected by and serves at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.

RISK FACTORS The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face. Strategic Risks General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets. In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. 14 A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See "" Item 1. Business "" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments. Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Other segments are substantially reducing operations which could also result in competition rushing to fill the void created by such corporate actions. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business. Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance. The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate. Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A . Failure to successfully execute this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance. Furthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term. The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our retail operations. These arrangements may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance or business relationship could materially adversely affect our financial performance. 15 Operational Risks Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; severe changes in climate; geo-political events; global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak; and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores. For example, our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were negatively impacted by riots and looting in Chile which resulted in us closing a number of our stores until the disruption abated. We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as the recent coronavirus outbreak which could result in potential disruptions or delays to our global supply chain), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, 16 third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to such sales apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes could expose us to loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth strategy. We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations. Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations including nation states), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors. Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. Our information systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media, online advertising, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer various pickup and delivery programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' information including payment information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A. Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business. 17 Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Like most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information, and cause system failures and disruptions. Some of our systems have experienced limited security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. Any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, modified, lost or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. In addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security compromise could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, security breaches or other compromises from known malware or other threats that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any cyber-attack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. 18 Additionally, we offer money (wire) transfer services, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders and check cashing and we sell prepaid cards and gift cards. We further offer co-branded credit cards and installment loans through financial services partners. These products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation. The Company also has compliance obligations associated with new privacy laws enacted to protect personal information. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, (CCPA), grants California consumers certain rights over their personal information and imposes stringent requirements on the collection, use and sharing of “personal information” of California consumers. Other U.S. states are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal information and the U.S. federal government is also considering federal privacy legislation. Outside the U.S., the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of EU law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data. Complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur additional costs and expenses. If we fail to comply with CCPA, GDPR or other privacy related regulations, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with them, it could lead to regulatory enforcement action, monetary fines or penalties (up to 4% of worldwide revenue in the case of GDPR), lawsuits or reputational damage and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, as well as the recent addition of Walmart Health Centers to some of our U.S. stores. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (""PBMs""). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business. If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies. One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs, distribution centers and corporate offices, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised 19 employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, such as our recent leadership changes, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Financial Risks Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations. Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations. We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies. Additionally, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock. Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance. In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. During fiscal 2020, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 23% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. For example, during the current transition period following the UK’s recent exit from the European Union, we face continued uncertainty regarding the impact on our UK business of potential changes in tariffs, trade practices and other regulations while the UK and EU work to put in place alternative trade and other arrangements. 20 The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S.. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S.. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance. In fiscal 2020, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 77% of our consolidated net sales. The federal government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business. We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles. For example, in December 2019, India enacted a bill which significantly reduced the corporate income tax for certain companies with operations in India. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act"") significantly changed income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations with additional guidance from the U.S. tax authority still pending. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act, including collecting information not regularly produced by the Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made. 21 Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance. We operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Our pharmacy and other healthcare operations in the U.S. are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act, laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the ""FDA"") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the ""DEA""), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services. For example, in the U.S. the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition, and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available, such as our money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, sanctions, fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protection. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. 22 We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws. In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. (""Asda""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in numerous ""equal value"" claims pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the ""Employment Tribunal"") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former Asda store employees, allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of employees working in Asda's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters . The Company has been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and is also a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters. We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption "" Item 3. Legal Proceedings "" and in Note 10 in the "" Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements ,"" which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or shareholders in such capacity. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, employee or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. This exclusive forum provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, entitled ""Contingencies,"" which is included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. Asda Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal). National Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of March 6, 2020; some cases are in the process of being transferred to the MDL or have remand motions pending; and there are over 200 additional state cases, including those remanded to state court, pending as of March 6, 2020. The case citations for the state cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS: The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company’s consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company’s money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in January 2020. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas. The Company has also been responding to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission related to money transfers and the Company’s anti-fraud program. Due to the investigative stage of these matters, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigations by the governmental entities. While the Company does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In September 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified the Company that it had initiated an administrative penalty action by issuing a Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order. The letter accompanying the Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order alleges that the Company distributed and/or sold three unregistered pesticide products from March to June, 2017. The EPA is seeking a penalty of $960,000. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for ensuring that a FIFRA-regulated product is properly registered prior to its sale. The Company is cooperating with the EPA. In January 2018, the Environmental Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuraduría Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of approximately $163,000 for the absence of an Environmental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company is challenging the fine. In April 2017, the California Air Resources Board (the ""ARB"") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimed deposits collected on sales of small containers of automotive refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs. The ARB alleged that the Company had improperly retained approximately $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and has sought reimbursement. The Company has denied any wrongdoing. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming.

Comparable sales include fuel. (2) As described in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on February 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) under the modified retrospective approach, and thus financial statements prior to fiscal 2020 were not recast for the adoption of this standard. 29 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020 ""), January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019 "") and January 31, 2018 (""fiscal 2018 "") should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we updated our definition of what was previously referred to as traffic (a component, along with ticket, of comparable sales). Traffic is now referred to as ""transactions"" and measures a percentage change in the number of sales transactions in our comparable stores, as well as for comparable eCommerce activity. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Generally, our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 . We have taken strategic actions to strengthen our portfolio for the long-term, including: • Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart"") in August 2018, which negatively impacted fiscal 2020 and 2019 net income. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the transaction. • Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (""Advent"") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the transaction. • Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile and Walmart Canada in December 2018 and April 2019, respectively. • Asda made a $1.0 billion cash contribution to the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the ""Plan"") in October 2019 which enabled the Plan to purchase a bulk insurance annuity contract for the benefit of Plan participants in anticipation that each Plan participant will be issued an individual annuity contract. The issuer of the individual annuity insurance contracts will be solely responsible for paying each participant’s benefits in full and will release the Plan and Asda from any future obligations. Once all Plan participants have been issued individual annuity contracts, we currently 30 estimate that we will recognize a total, pre-tax charge of approximately $2.2 billion related to the pension settlement in late fiscal 2021 or early fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on the transaction. We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, global health epidemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Additionally, we are monitoring the potential impact of the recent coronavirus outbreak to our global business. Its financial impact is unknown at this time. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under "" Item 1A. Risk Factors ,"" and under "" Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements ."" Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expanding omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , were as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2020 2019 2020 2019 With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 2.9% 3.7% 0.0% 0.1% Sam's Club 1.6% 5.4% 0.8% 1.6% Total U.S. 2.7% 4.0% 0.1% 0.4% Walmart U.S. comparable sales increased 2.9% and 3.7% in fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, driven by ticket and transactions growth. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.7% and 1.3% to comparable sales for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers . Sam's Club comparable sales increased 1.6% and 5.4% in fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Sam's Club comparable sales for both fiscal 2020 and 2019 benefited from growth in transactions and higher fuel sales, which were partially offset by lower ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club fiscal 2019 comparable sales were further aided by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.5% and 0.9% to comparable sales for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 31 Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 Net sales $ 519,926 $ 510,329 Percentage change from comparable period 1.9 % 2.9 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 108,791 $ 107,147 Percentage change from comparable period 1.5 % 0.6 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 20.9 % 21.0 % For fiscal 2020 , operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales. These improvements were partially offset by $0.9 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, and other business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments. For fiscal 2019, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping of certain fiscal 2018 charges. The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit. Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As such, we are allocating more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years. Total fiscal 2020 capital expenditures increased slightly compared to the prior year; the following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Fiscal Years Ended January 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2020 2019 eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other $ 5,643 $ 5,218 Remodels 2,184 2,152 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 77 313 Total U.S. $ 7,904 $ 7,683 Walmart International 2,801 2,661 Total capital expenditures $ 10,705 $ 10,344 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.7% and 3.4% for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily due to the change in fair value of the investment in JD.com and lapping the $4.5 billion net loss recorded in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, partially offset by the dilution to operating income related to Flipkart. ROI was 13.4% and 14.2% for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The decrease in ROI was due to the decrease in operating income primarily as a result of the dilution from Flipkart as well as business restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2020. The denominator remained relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart was offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from the removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (""ASU 2016-02"") since operating lease right of use assets are now included in total assets. 32 We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8 is no longer included in the calculation of ROI on a prospective basis as operating lease assets are now capitalized. For fiscal 2020, lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of the current balance sheet date, rather than averaged, because they are no longer directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8. A two-point average will be used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard. Further, beginning prospectively in fiscal 2020, rent expense in the numerator excludes short-term and variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the operating lease right of use asset balance. Prior to adoption of ASU 2016-02, we defined ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8, which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. Because the new lease standard was adopted under the modified retrospective approach as of February 1, 2019, our calculation of ROI for fiscal 2019 was not revised. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 15,201 $ 7,179 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 227,895 $ 211,909 Return on assets (ROA) 6.7 % 3.4 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 20,568 $ 21,957 + Interest income 189 217 + Depreciation and amortization 10,987 10,678 + Rent 2,670 3,004 ROI operating income $ 34,414 $ 35,856 Denominator Average total assets (1), (2) $ 235,277 $ 211,909 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1), (2) 90,351 85,107 - Average accounts payable (1) 47,017 46,576 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 22,228 22,141 + Rent x 8 N/A 24,032 Average invested capital $ 256,383 $ 252,331 Return on investment (ROI) 13.4 % 14.2 % 33 As of January 31, 2020 2019 2018 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 236,495 $ 219,295 $ 204,522 Leased assets, net 21,841 7,078 NP Total assets without leased assets, net 214,654 212,217 NP Accumulated depreciation and amortization 94,514 87,175 83,039 Accumulated amortization on leased assets 4,694 5,682 NP Accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets 89,820 81,493 NP Accounts payable 46,973 47,060 46,092 Accrued liabilities 22,296 22,159 22,122 (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the corresponding prior period and dividing by 2. Average total assets as used in ROA includes the average impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 (2) For fiscal 2020, as a result of adopting ASU 2016-02, average total assets is based on the average of total assets without leased assets, net plus leased assets, net as of January 31, 2020. Average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets plus accumulated amortization on leased assets as of January 31, 2020. NP = Not provided. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $25.3 billion , $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We generated free cash flow of $14.6 billion , $17.4 billion and $18.3 billion for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the contribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart operations, and the timing of vendor payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in increased capital expenditures . Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from the Tax Act and the timing of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 25,255 $ 27,753 $ 28,337 Payments for property and equipment (10,705 ) (10,344 ) (10,051 ) Free cash flow $ 14,550 $ 17,409 $ 18,286 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (9,128 ) $ (24,036 ) $ (9,079 ) Net cash used in financing activities (14,299 ) (2,537 ) (19,875 ) (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 34 Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 2018 Total revenues $ 523,964 $ 514,405 $ 500,343 Percentage change from comparable period 1.9 % 2.8 % 3.0 % Net sales $ 519,926 $ 510,329 $ 495,761 Percentage change from comparable period 1.9 % 2.9 % 3.0 % Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 2.7 % 4.0 % 2.2 % Gross profit rate 24.1 % 24.5 % 24.7 % Operating income $ 20,568 $ 21,957 $ 20,437 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.0 % 4.3 % 4.1 % Consolidated net income $ 15,201 $ 7,179 $ 10,523 Unit counts at period end (1) 11,501 11,361 11,718 Retail square feet at period end (1) 1,129 1,129 1,158 (1) Unit counts and associated retail square feet are presented for stores and clubs generally open as of period end. Permanently closed locations are not included. Our total revenues, which includes net sales and membership and other income, increased $9.6 billion or 1.9% and $14.1 billion or 2.8% for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenues were due to increases in net sales, which increased $9.6 billion or 1.9% and $14.6 billion or 2.9% for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with the addition of net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in August 2018, and positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets. These increases were partially offset by $4.1 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2020 and our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018. For fiscal 2019 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our International markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, for fiscal 2019, the increase in net sales was partially offset by a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales due to club closures in the Sam's Club segment during fiscal 2018, a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in the International segment, and $0.7 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our gross profit rate decreased 40 and 18 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , these decreases were primarily due to price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment and the addition of Flipkart in the Walmart International segment, partially offset by favorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was due to the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business, the acquisition of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expenses. For fiscal 2020 , operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales. These improvements were partially offset by $0.9 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, and other business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments. For fiscal 2019, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping approximately $1.8 billion in certain charges in fiscal 2018. The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $0.2 billion charge related to a securities class action lawsuit. Other gains and losses consisted of a gain of $2.0 billion for fiscal 2020 and a loss of $8.4 billion for fiscal 2019 . The gain in fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of a $1.9 billion increase in the market value of our investment in JD.com. The loss in fiscal 2019 is primarily the result of the $4.8 billion pre-tax loss on the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and a $3.5 billion decrease in the market value of our investment in JD.com. Fiscal 2018 results included loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.1 billion. 35 Our effective income tax rate was 24.4% for fiscal 2020 , 37.4% for fiscal 2019 , and 30.4% for fiscal 2018 . The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the fiscal 2019 loss on sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which increased the comparative period's effective tax rate, as it provided minimal realizable tax benefit. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the aforementioned loss on sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil and Flipkart's results. Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 is presented in Note 9 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $15.2 billion and $7.2 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, which represents an increase of $8.0 billion and a decrease of $3.3 billion for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart (""EPS"") was $5.19 , $2.26 and $3.28 for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Walmart U.S. Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 2018 Net sales $ 341,004 $ 331,666 $ 318,477 Percentage change from comparable period 2.8 % 4.1 % 3.5 % Calendar comparable sales increase 2.9 % 3.7 % 2.1 % Operating income $ 17,380 $ 17,386 $ 16,995 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.1 % 5.2 % 5.3 % Unit counts at period end 4,756 4,769 4,761 Retail square feet at period end 703 705 705 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $9.3 billion or 2.8% and $13.2 billion or 4.1% for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 2.9% and 3.7% for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, driven by ticket and transaction growth. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.7% and 1.3% to comparable sales for fiscal 2020 and 2019 . Gross profit rate decreased 14 and 28 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , the decreases were primarily the result of continued price investments which were partially offset by better merchandise mix, including strength in private brands, and less pressure from transportation costs. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy, increased transportation expenses, and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 4 basis points for fiscal 2020 and decreased 23 basis points for fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. We leveraged operating expenses in fiscal 2020 as a result of strong sales and productivity improvements which were mostly offset by business restructuring charges of $0.5 billion consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charges due to decisions that resulted in the write down of certain eCommerce assets. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and the prior year comparable period including charges related to discontinued real estate projects of $0.2 billion. These improvements more than offset investments in eCommerce, technology and omni-channel initiatives and raising the starting wage rate at the beginning of fiscal 2019. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $6 million and increased $391 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. 36 Walmart International Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 2018 Net sales $ 120,130 $ 120,824 $ 118,068 Percentage change from comparable period (0.6 )% 2.3 % 1.7 % Operating income $ 3,370 $ 4,883 $ 5,229 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.8 % 4.0 % 4.4 % Unit counts at period end 6,146 5,993 6,360 Retail square feet at period end 345 344 373 Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $0.7 billion or 0.6% and increased $2.8 billion or 2.3% for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , the decrease was primarily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.1 billion as well as a reduction in sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018, offset by a full year of net sales from Flipkart and positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets. For fiscal 2019 , the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, a $0.7 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the continued wind down of our first party Brazil eCommerce operations and a reduction in net sales of $140 million due to divesting our Suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Gross profit rate decreased 136 and 41 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , the decrease was primarily due to Flipkart, as well as a change in merchandise mix. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was due to Flipkart and strategic price investments in certain markets. Membership and other income decreased 1.1% and 22.4% for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to currency while fiscal 2019 decreased due to the prior year recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 13 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 37 basis points for 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and cost discipline across multiple markets, partially offset by $0.4 billion in impairment charges which was due primarily to the write-off of the carrying value of one of Flipkart's two fashion trade names, Jabong.com, as a result of a strategic decision to focus our efforts on a single fashion platform in order to simplify the business and customer proposition. Fiscal 2019 decreased primarily due to impairment charges in the previous fiscal year of approximately $0.5 billion, which included charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations; this decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by the addition of operating expenses from Flipkart in fiscal 2019. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $1.5 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Sam's Club Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 2018 Including Fuel Net sales $ 58,792 $ 57,839 $ 59,216 Percentage change from comparable period 1.6 % (2.3 )% 3.2 % Calendar comparable sales increase 1.6 % 5.4 % 2.8 % Operating income $ 1,642 $ 1,520 $ 915 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.8 % 2.6 % 1.5 % Unit counts at period end 599 599 597 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 52,792 $ 52,332 $ 54,456 Percentage change from comparable period 0.9 % (3.9 )% 2.2 % Operating income $ 1,486 $ 1,383 $ 797 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.8 % 2.6 % 1.5 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. 37 Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $1.0 billion or 1.6% for fiscal 2020 and decreased $1.4 billion or 2.3% for fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , the increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 1.6% . Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and higher fuel sales, which were partially offset by lower ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.5% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was primarily due to a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales resulting from the net closure of 63 clubs during fiscal 2018, as well as reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations. These decreases were partially offset by increases in comparable sales, which were benefited by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.9% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019. Additional fuel sales of $0.7 billion partially offset the decreases in net sales for fiscal 2019. Gross profit rate decreased 11 basis points for fiscal 2020 and remained relatively flat for fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The gross profit rate decreased due to investments in price and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales, which have lower margins. For fiscal 2019 , gross profit rate was benefited by lapping the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures in fiscal 2018 and decreased tobacco sales in fiscal 2019. This benefit to the gross profit rate was offset by higher transportation costs and eCommerce shipping costs, investments in price and increased shrink in fiscal 2019. Membership and other income increased 4.7% and 2.6% for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , the increase was primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration along with gains on property sales and other income. For fiscal 2019 , the increase was due to an increase of 1.5% in membership income resulting from increased Plus Member penetration and gains on property sales. These increases were partially offset by lower recycling income when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 19 and 99 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020 , the decrease was primarily the result of lower labor-related costs and a charge of approximately $50 million related to lease exit costs in the prior comparable period. These benefits were partially offset by a reduction in sales of tobacco and a higher level of technology investment. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately $0.6 billion in the prior year's comparable period related to club closures and discontinued real estate projects. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $122 million for fiscal 2020 and increased $605 million f or fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 25,255 $ 27,753 $ 28,337 Net cash provided by operating activities was $25.3 billion , $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 decreased when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the contribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart operations, and the timing of vendor payments. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from Tax Reform and the timing of tax payments. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $9.5 billion and $7.7 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Our working capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $16.0 billion and $15.6 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. 38 We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. While we are awaiting anticipated technical guidance from the IRS and the U.S. Treasury department, we do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.3 billion as of January 31, 2020 , approximately $0.6 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Net cash used in investing activities $ (9,128 ) $ (24,036 ) $ (9,079 ) Net cash used in investing activities was $9.1 billion , $24.0 billion and $9.1 billion for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and generally consisted of payments for business acquisitions and to expand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other technologies, remodel existing stores and club and add new stores and clubs. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $14.9 billion for fiscal 2020 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as a result of the $13.8 billion payment for the acquisition of Flipkart, net of cash acquired, as well as payments for other, smaller acquisitions in fiscal 2019. Net cash used in investing activities increased $15.0 billion for fiscal 2019 when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to the previously mentioned fiscal 2019 acquisitions. Additionally, refer to the "" Strategic Capital Allocation "" section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2020 and 2019 . Growth Activities For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021 ""), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $11 billion, with a focus on store remodels and customer initiatives, eCommerce, technology, and supply chain. We also expect to add approximately 250 new stores in Walmart International, primarily in Mexico and China. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Net cash used in financing activities $ (14,299 ) $ (2,537 ) $ (19,875 ) Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Fiscal 2020 net cash used in financing activities increased $11.8 billion when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the $15.9 billion of net proceeds received in the prior year from the issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart partially offset by $5.5 billion of additional long-term debt in the current year to fund general business operations. Fiscal 2019 net cash used in financing activities decreased $17.3 billion for fiscal 2019 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to the $15.9 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart and for general corporate purposes, as well as a decrease in share repurchases due to the suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the Flipkart announcement. Short-term Borrowings Net cash flows used in short-term borrowings increased in fiscal 2020 and were relatively flat in fiscal 2019 . We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. For fiscal 2020 , the additional cash used in short-term borrowings was primarily due to long-term debt issuances being used to pay down short-term borrowings. The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 : 39 Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end $ 13,315 $ 13,389 $ 11,386 Average daily short-term borrowings 7,120 10,625 8,131 Annual weighted-average interest rate 2.5 % 2.4 % 1.3 % In addition to our short-term borrowings, we have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.9 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. , as of January 31, 2020 , that provide additional liquidity, if needed. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2020 : (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2019 $ 1,876 $ 43,520 $ 45,396 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 5,492 5,492 Payments of long-term debt (1,907 ) — (1,907 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 5,378 (5,378 ) — Other 15 80 95 Balances as of January 31, 2020 $ 5,362 $ 43,714 $ 49,076 Our total long-term debt increased $3.7 billion for fiscal 2020 , primarily due to the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in both April 2019 and September 2019 to fund general business operations, partially offset by repayments of long-term debt. Dividends Our total dividend payments were $6.0 billion , $6.1 billion and $6.1 billion for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Board of Directors approved, effective February 18, 2020 , the fiscal 2021 annual dividend of $2.16 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $2.12 per share. For fiscal 2021 , the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.54 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 20, 2020 April 6, 2020 May 8, 2020 June 1, 2020 August 14, 2020 September 8, 2020 December 11, 2020 January 4, 2021 Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal 2020 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of January 31, 2020 , authorization for $5.7 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 : Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 2018 Total number of shares repurchased 53.9 79.5 104.9 Average price paid per share $ 105.98 $ 93.18 $ 79.11 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 5,717 $ 7,410 $ 8,296 Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. 40 We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2020 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and certain contingent commitments as of January 31, 2020 : Payments Due During Fiscal Years Ending January 31, (Amounts in millions) Total 2021 2022-2023 2024-2025 Thereafter Recorded contractual obligations (3) : Long-term debt (1) $ 49,180 $ 5,362 $ 5,839 $ 9,019 $ 28,960 Short-term borrowings 575 575 — — — Operating lease obligations (2) 26,257 2,587 4,496 3,660 15,514 Finance lease obligations and other (2)(3) 10,254 1,000 1,729 1,298 6,227 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Estimated interest on long-term debt 22,957 1,780 3,268 2,872 15,037 Syndicated and other letters of credit 1,987 1,987 — — — Purchase obligations 12,782 5,912 4,318 1,480 1,072 Total contractual obligations $ 123,992 $ 19,203 $ 19,650 $ 18,329 $ 66,810 (1) Long-term debt includes the fair value of our derivatives designated as fair value hedges. (2) Represents our contractual obligations to make future payments under non-cancelable operating leases and finance lease agreements, both of which are recorded on the balance sheet at their present value. Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding operating and finance leases. (3) Finance lease obligations and other includes contractual obligations under other financing obligations of $1.4 billion. Under the terms of the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil, we agreed to indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion , adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. As of January 31, 2020 , the indemnification liability recorded was $0.7 billion and included in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, we have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.9 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2020 , and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate debt. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. For the purposes of the above table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the table above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time 41 periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. The expected timing for payment discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $1.8 billion of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities. The timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 31, 2020 , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Other Matters We discuss our recently resolved FCPA investigation in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" and appears elsewhere herein. We discuss our ""Asda Equal Value Claims"" which includes certain existing employment claims against our United Kingdom subsidiary, ASDA Stores, Ltd., including certain risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the caption ""Risk Factors"" and under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings"" in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" and appears elsewhere herein. We also discuss the National Prescription Opiate Litigation and related matters including certain risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the caption ""Risk Factors"" and under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings"" in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" and appears elsewhere herein. We also discuss various legal proceedings related to the Asda Equal Value Claims and National Prescription Opiate Litigation in Part I, Item 3 herein under the caption ""Legal Proceedings."" The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represent contingencies of the Company that may or may not result in the Company incurring a material liability upon their final resolution. Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates. Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. Inventories We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. Impairment of Assets We evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. Impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2020 were 42 immaterial. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2020 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which included full impairment of all related-assets, there were no other material impairment charges for fiscal 2019. Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2020 , our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have also historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost; however, due to certain strategic restructuring decisions in fiscal 2020, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion in impairment related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. Contingencies We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Taxes Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net 43 operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on estimates. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act"") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard–setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of our equity investment in JD.com. The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2020 , the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased $175 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2020 . Expected Maturity Date (Amounts in millions) Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2025 Thereafter Total Liabilities Short-term borrowings: Variable rate $ 575 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 575 Weighted-average interest rate 5.0 % — % — % — % — % — % 5.0 % Long-term debt (1) : Fixed rate $ 4,612 $ 2,366 $ 2,802 $ 4,670 $ 4,400 $ 28,726 $ 47,576 Weighted-average interest rate 2.8 % 3.8 % 1.7 % 3.2 % 2.7 % 4.4 % 3.8 % Variable rate $ 750 $ 750 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,500 Weighted-average interest rate 2.0 % 2.2 % — % — % — % — % 2.1 % Interest rate derivatives Interest rate swaps: Fixed to variable $ 750 $ — $ — $ 1,750 $ 1,500 $ — $ 4,000 Weighted-average pay rate 3.2 % — % — % 2.2 % 2.8 % — % 2.6 % Weighted-average receive rate 3.3 % — % — % 2.6 % 3.3 % — % 3.0 % (1) The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives classified as fair value hedges. As of January 31, 2020 , our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 12% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2020 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $61 million . 44 Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S, as well our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt. For fiscal 2020 , movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in the UK and Mexico were the primary cause of the $0.3 billion gain in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss. We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $241 million and asset position of $62 million as of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 , respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2020 . The hypothetical result of a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $173 million . A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2020 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $42 million . In addition to currency swaps, we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our foreign operations. We had outstanding long-term debt of £1.7 billion as of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in the UK. As of January 31, 2020 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $201 million . In addition, we had outstanding long-term debt of ¥180 billion as of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in Japan. As of January 31, 2020 , a hypothetical 10% change in value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $150 million . In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies. Investment Risk We are exposed to changes in the JD.com (""JD"") stock price as a result of our equity investment in JD. The change in fair value is recorded within other gains and losses resulted in a gain of $1.9 billion in fiscal 2020 due to an increase in the stock price of JD. As of January 31, 2020 , the fair value of our equity investment in JD was $5.4 billion . As of January 31, 2020 , a hypothetical 10% change in the stock price of JD would have changed our investment in JD by approximately $550 million. 45 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""Consolidated Financial Statements""). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases effective February 1, 2019, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Contingencies Description of the Matter As described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at January 31, 2020, the Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and has made accruals with respect to certain of these matters. For other matters, a liability is not probable, or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. Where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. Management assessed the probability of occurrence and the estimation of any potential loss based on the ability to predict the number of claims that may be filed or whether any loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. For example, in assessing the probability of occurrence in a particular legal proceeding, management exercises judgment to determine if it can predict the number of claims that may be filed and whether it can reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from that proceeding. 47 Auditing management’s accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our assessment of the significant judgments made by management when assessing the probability of occurrence or when determining whether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and evaluation of contingencies. For example, we tested controls over the Company’s assessment of the likelihood of loss and the Company’s determinations regarding the measurement of loss. To test the Company’s assessment of the probability of occurrence or determination of an estimate of loss, or range of loss, among other procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors and committees of the board of directors, reviewed opinions provided to the Company by certain outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and external counsel, and evaluated the current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal legal counsel. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures. Valuation of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Description of the Matter At January 31, 2020, the Company has $5.2 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets. As disclosed in Notes 1, 8 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, these assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually using valuation techniques to estimate fair value. These fair value estimates are sensitive to certain significant assumptions including revenue growth rates, discount rates, and royalty rates. Auditing management’s annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant measurement uncertainty in determining the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangibles. For example, the fair value estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions identified above that are affected by future market or economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment review process. Our procedures included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions described above used to estimate the fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. To test the estimated fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies used to determine the fair value, testing the significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company. For example, we evaluated management’s forecasted revenue growth rates used in the fair value estimates by comparing those assumptions to the historical results of the Company and current industry, market and economic forecasts. We involved a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating the valuation methodologies and the significant assumptions such as discount rates and royalty rates. Additionally, we performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the effect on the fair value estimates of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 1969. Rogers, Arkansas March 20, 2020 48 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. as of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2020 , and the related notes and our report dated March 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Rogers, Arkansas March 20, 2020 49 Walmart Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General Walmart Inc. (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers. Each week, the Company serves over 265 million customers who visit approximately 11,500 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 56 banners in 27 countries. The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020 ""), January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019 "") and January 31, 2018 (""fiscal 2018 ""). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2020 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.4 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Most of the Company's $ 9.5 billion and $ 7.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 were held outside of the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations. The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $ 2.3 billion and $ 2.8 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $ 2.3 billion as of January 31, 2020 , approximately $ 0.6 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart"") minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Receivables Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which also includes insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales, banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 , receivables from transactions with customers, net were $ 2.9 billion and $ 2.5 billion , respectively. 55 Inventories The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory for the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (""FIFO"") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale represent components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. The Company reviews all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values. As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 , immaterial amounts for assets and liabilities held for sale were classified in prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis: As of January 31, (Amounts in millions) Estimated Useful Lives 2020 2019 Land N/A $ 24,619 $ 24,526 Buildings and improvements 3-40 years 105,674 101,006 Fixtures and equipment 1-30 years 58,607 54,488 Transportation equipment 3-15 years 2,377 2,316 Construction in progress N/A 3,751 3,474 Property and equipment 195,028 185,810 Accumulated depreciation ( 89,820 ) ( 81,493 ) Property and equipment, net $ 105,208 $ 104,317 Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and financing obligations, property under capital leases and intangible assets for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 was $ 11.0 billion , $ 10.7 billion and $ 10.5 billion , respectively. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet. The Company adopted this ASU and related amendments as of February 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach and elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to determine if they contain leases. For leases subject to index or rate adjustments, the most current index or rate adjustments were included in the measurement of operating lease obligations at adoption. The adoption of this ASU and related amendments resulted in a $ 14.8 billion increase to total assets and a $ 15.1 billion increase to total liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $ 16.8 billion and $ 17.5 billion of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations, respectively, and removed $ 2.2 billion and $ 1.7 billion , respectively, of assets and liabilities related to financial obligations connected with the construction of leased stores. Several other asset and liability line items in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet were also impacted by immaterial amounts. Additionally, the adoption resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $ 0.3 billion , net of tax, which primarily consisted of the recognition of impairment. The Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows were immaterially impacted. Accounting policies as a result of the adoption of this ASU are described below. Refer to Note 7 for additional lease disclosures. For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company records right-of-use (""ROU"") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are 56 initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments. Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2020 , the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill. The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2020 and 2019 : (Amounts in millions) Walmart U.S. Walmart International Sam's Club Total Balances as of February 1, 2018 $ 2,445 $ 15,484 $ 313 $ 18,242 Changes in currency translation and other — ( 743 ) — ( 743 ) Acquisitions (1) 107 13,575 — 13,682 Balances as of January 31, 2019 2,552 28,316 313 31,181 Changes in currency translation and other — ( 149 ) — ( 149 ) Acquisitions 41 — — 41 Balances as of January 31, 2020 $ 2,593 $ 28,167 $ 313 $ 31,073 (1) Goodwill recorded in fiscal 2019 for Walmart International relates to Flipkart. Intangible assets are included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $ 5.2 billion and $ 5.8 billion , respectively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which is primarily made up of acquired trade names. Refer to Note 12 for additional information related to acquired intangible assets for the Flipkart acquisition. During fiscal 2020 , the Company incurred approximately $ 0.7 billion in impairment charges related to its intangible assets. There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2019 and 2018 . Refer to Note 8 for additional information. 57 Fair Value Measurement In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-01, Financial Instruments–Overall (Topic 825) , which updated certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments (""ASU 2016-01""). The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which primarily impacted the Company's accounting for its investment in JD.com, Inc. (""JD"") and resulted in a positive adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $ 2.6 billion , net of tax, in fiscal 2019 based on the market value of the Company's investment in JD as of January 31, 2018. The adoption required prospective changes in fair value of the Company's investment in JD to be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income, which the Company classifies in other gains and losses. The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Refer to Note 8 for more information. Self Insurance Reserves The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits . Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability. Derivatives The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty. The Company enters into derivatives with counterparties rated only ""A-"" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The Company is subject to master netting arrangements which provides set-off and close out netting of exposures with counterparties, but the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s collateral arrangements requires the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-determined thresholds, after considering the effects of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral. Cash collateral received under these arrangements was not significant as of January 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company was not required to provide any cash collateral to counterparties as of January 31, 2020 and 2019. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, derivative gains and losses are recorded through the same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings. Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 8 for the presentation of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities. Fair Value Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from October 2020 to April 2024 . Cash Flow Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The Company records changes in the fair value of these swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is subsequently 58 reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2022 to March 2034 . Net Investment Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with net investments of certain of its foreign operations. The Company records changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk in accumulated other comprehensive loss. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to February 2030 . The Company also designated certain foreign currency denominated long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of these operations. The Company records foreign currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $ 3.9 billion , respectively, of outstanding long-term debt designated as net investment hedges. These derivative and non-derivative gains or losses continue to defer in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the sale or substantial liquidation of these foreign operations. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (""temporary differences""). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains a provision which subjects a U.S. parent of a foreign subsidiary to current U.S. tax on its global intangible low–taxed income (“GILTI”). The GILTI income is eligible for a deduction, which lowers the effective tax rate to 10.5 % for calendar years 2018 through 2025 and 13.125 % after 2025. The Company will report the tax impact of GILTI as a period cost when incurred. Accordingly, the Company is not providing deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI. In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures. Revenue Recognition Net Sales The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or services to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns. Membership Fee Revenue The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $ 1.5 billion for fiscal 2020 and $ 1.4 billion for each of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gift Cards Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members 59 can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period. Financial and Other Services The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs. Payments from Suppliers The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold. Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In certain limited situations, reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific, incremental and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs were $ 3.7 billion , $ 3.5 billion and $ 3.1 billion for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2020 with no material impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 . 60 The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 2018 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 15,201 $ 7,179 $ 10,523 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 320 ) ( 509 ) ( 661 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 14,881 $ 6,670 $ 9,862 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,850 2,929 2,995 Dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards 18 16 15 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,868 2,945 3,010 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 5.22 $ 2.28 $ 3.29 Diluted 5.19 2.26 3.28 Note 3. Shareholders' Equity The total authorized shares of $ 0.10 par value common stock is 11.0 billion , of which 2.8 billion and 2.9 billion were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Share-Based Compensation The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $ 854 million , $ 773 million and $ 626 million for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $ 202 million , $ 181 million and $ 150 million for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type for all plans: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Restricted stock and performance share units $ 270 $ 293 $ 234 Restricted stock units 553 456 368 Other 31 24 24 Share-based compensation expense $ 854 $ 773 $ 626 The Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the ""Plan""), as amended and restated effective February 23, 2016, as amended further as of February 1, 2017, and as renamed on February 1, 2018, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders. The Plan's award types are summarized as follows: • Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0 % to 150 % of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years . Restricted stock and performance share units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance share units in fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 was 5.1 % , 6.2 % and 7.2 % , respectively. • Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period. Beginning in fiscal 2020, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 25 % each year over a four year period from the date of the grant. Prior to fiscal 2020, 50 % of restricted stock units generally vested three years from the grant date and the remaining 50 % were vested five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated 61 dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 was 4.9 % , 7.2 % and 9.0 % , respectively. In addition to the Plan, the Company's United Kingdom subsidiary has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years . The stock option share-based compensation expense is included in the Other line in the table above. Flipkart also maintains a stock option plan primarily for the benefit of employees and nonemployee directors under which options to acquire Flipkart common shares may be issued. The grants have no exercise price and no compensation expense was recognized during fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019 where a performance condition was not deemed probable of occurring. The following table shows the activity for restricted stock and performance share units and restricted stock units during fiscal 2020 : Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units Restricted Stock Units (Shares in thousands) Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share Outstanding as of February 1, 2019 8,799 $ 75.39 23,955 $ 70.47 Granted 3,354 100.38 8,504 95.92 Adjustment for performance achievement (1) 898 64.50 — — Vested/exercised ( 5,365 ) 67.96 ( 6,496 ) 68.13 Forfeited ( 1,641 ) 82.77 ( 2,702 ) 78.86 Outstanding as of January 31, 2020 6,045 $ 93.04 23,261 $ 79.51 (1) Represents the adjustment to previously granted performance share units for performance achievement.

All repurchases made during fiscal 2020 were made under the current $ 20.0 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of January 31, 2020 , authorization for 5.7 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations and the market price of the Company's common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 : Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 2018 Total number of shares repurchased 53.9 79.5 104.9 Average price paid per share $ 105.98 $ 93.18 $ 79.11 Total cash paid for share repurchases $ 5,717 $ 7,410 $ 8,296 62 Note 4.

Note 8. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company measures the fair value of equity investments (primarily its investment in JD) on a recurring basis and records them in other long-term assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Measurement details about the Company's two portions of the investment in JD are as follows: • The purchased portion of the investment in JD is measured using Level 1 inputs. • The portion of the investment in JD received in exchange for selling certain assets related to Yihaodian, the Company's former eCommerce operation in China, measured using Level 2 inputs. Fair value is determined primarily using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets. The fair value of the Company's investment in JD is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of January 31, 2020 Fair Value as of January 31, 2019 Investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs $ 2,715 $ 1,791 Investment in JD measured using Level 2 inputs 2,723 1,792 Total $ 5,438 $ 3,583 67 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019 , the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: January 31, 2020 January 31, 2019 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 4,000 $ 97 (1) $ 4,000 $ ( 78 ) (2) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges 3,750 455 (1) 2,250 334 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 4,067 ( 696 ) (2) 4,173 ( 272 ) (3) Total $ 11,817 $ ( 144 ) $ 10,423 $ ( 16 ) (1) Classified in Other long-term assets within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Classified in Deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. (3) Approximately $ 350 million of cash flow hedges were classified in Deferred income taxes and other and $ 78 million of cash flow were classified in Other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 , the Company recorded impairment charges related to assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis primarily related to the following: • in the Walmart U.S. segment, $ 0.5 billion in impairment charges for impaired assets consisting primarily of trade names and acquired developed software due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write-down of certain eCommerce assets; and • in the Walmart International segment, $ 0.4 billion in impairment charges consisting primarily of the write-off of the carrying value of one of Flipkart's two fashion trade names, Jabong.com, as a result of a strategic decision to focus on the Myntra.com fashion platform. These impairment charges were classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2020 were immaterial. As discussed in Note 12 , the Company sold the majority stake in Walmart Brazil during fiscal 2019. The assets of the disposal group totaled $ 3.3 billion and were comprised of $ 1.0 billion in current assets, $ 1.6 billion in property and equipment and property under capital lease and financing obligations, net, and $ 0.7 billion of other long-term assets. When measured as held for sale, these assets were fully impaired as the carrying value of the disposal group exceeded the fair value, less costs to sell and contributed to a pre-tax net loss of $ 4.8 billion in the Walmart International segment, which was recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. Other impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2019 were immaterial. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , are as follows: January 31, 2020 January 31, 2019 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 49,076 $ 57,769 $ 45,396 $ 49,570 68 Note 9. Taxes The components of income (loss) before income taxes are as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2018 U.S. $ 17,098 $ 15,875 $ 10,722 Non-U.S. 3,018 ( 4,415 ) 4,401 Total income before income taxes $ 20,116 $ 11,460 $ 15,123 A summary of the provision for income taxes is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Current: U.S. federal $ 2,794 $ 2,763 $ 2,998 U.S. state and local 587 493 405 International 1,205 1,495 1,377 Total current tax provision 4,586 4,751 4,780 Deferred: U.S. federal 663 ( 361 ) ( 22 ) U.S. state and local 35 ( 16 ) ( 12 ) International ( 369 ) ( 93 ) ( 146 ) Total deferred tax expense (benefit) 329 ( 470 ) ( 180 ) Total provision for income taxes $ 4,915 $ 4,281 $ 4,600 In December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and significantly changed U.S. income tax law. Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate and created new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI""). In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""SAB 118""), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Management completed the Company's accounting for Tax Reform in fiscal 2019 based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was $ 207 million , and in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $ 442 million of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for income taxes. One-time Transition Tax The Tax Act required the Company to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5 % to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0 % on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $ 1.9 billion of additional income tax expense for its one-time transitional tax liability. The Company calculated the Transition Tax liability and increased the provisional amount by $ 413 million , with the increase included as a component of provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019. Deferred Tax Effects The Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35.0 % to 21.0 % , beginning January 2018. Accordingly, the Company re-measured its deferred taxes as of January 31, 2018, to reflect the reduced rate that will apply in future periods when these deferred taxes are settled or realized. In fiscal 2018, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of $ 2.1 billion to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate and other effects of the Tax Act. In fiscal 2018, the Company made no provisional adjustment with respect to the GILTI provision of the Tax Act. Upon finalizing the provisional accounting for the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded an additional tax benefit of $ 75 million , which is included as a component of provision for income taxes. 69 Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation In the past, the Company's effective income tax rate was typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower-taxed global operations partially offset by a valuation allowance. However, beginning January 2018, the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0 % generally falls below statutory rates in international jurisdictions. A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2020 2019 2018 U.S. statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 33.8 % U.S. state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 2.2 % 3.0 % 1.7 % Impact of the Tax Act: One-time transition tax — % 3.6 % 12.3 % Deferred tax effects — % ( 0.7 )% ( 14.1 )% Income taxed outside the U.S. ( 1.0 )% ( 3.4 )% ( 6.3 )% Disposition of Walmart Brazil — % 6.7 % — % Valuation allowance 2.3 % 6.3 % 2.1 % Net impact of repatriated international earnings 0.4 % 0.8 % ( 0.1 )% Federal tax credits ( 0.8 )% ( 1.3 )% ( 0.9 )% Enacted change in tax laws ( 1.9 )% — % — % Change in reserve for tax contingencies 2.5 % 0.6 % ( 0.1 )% Other, net ( 0.3 )% 0.8 % 2.0 % Effective income tax rate 24.4 % 37.4 % 30.4 % Deferred Taxes The significant components of the Company's deferred tax account balances are as follows: January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets: Loss and tax credit carryforwards $ 9,056 $ 2,964 Accrued liabilities 2,483 2,135 Share-based compensation 250 245 Lease obligations 4,098 — Other 1,020 1,131 Total deferred tax assets 16,907 6,475 Valuation allowances ( 8,588 ) ( 2,448 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 8,319 4,027 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment 4,621 4,175 Acquired intangibles 1,152 2,099 Inventory 1,414 1,354 Lease right of use assets 3,998 — Mark-to-market investments 724 335 Other 700 564 Total deferred tax liabilities 12,609 8,527 Net deferred tax liabilities $ 4,290 $ 4,500 The deferred taxes noted above are classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Balance Sheet classification Assets: Other long-term assets $ 1,914 $ 1,796 Liabilities: Deferred income taxes and other 6,204 6,296 Net deferred tax liabilities $ 4,290 $ 4,500 70 Unremitted Earnings Prior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. As of January 31, 2020, the Company has not recorded approximately $ 3 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation. Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances As of January 31, 2020 , the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $ 37.8 billion . Of these carryforwards, approximately $ 25.2 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2040 . The remaining carryforwards have no expiration. The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To the extent that a valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The Company had valuation allowances of $ 8.6 billion and $ 2.4 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to tax law changes in Luxembourg enacted in December 2019 the Company recognized additional deferred tax assets, and related valuation allowances, of $ 6.2 billion associated with existing net operating loss carryforwards. Other activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2020 related to valuation allowance increases in other markets, as well as releases due to the expiration of underlying deferred tax assets. Uncertain Tax Positions The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $ 1.8 billion and $ 1.3 billion , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.1 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 1,305 $ 1,010 $ 1,050 Increases related to prior year tax positions 516 620 130 Decreases related to prior year tax positions ( 15 ) ( 107 ) ( 254 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 66 203 122 Settlements during the period ( 29 ) ( 390 ) ( 23 ) Lapse in statutes of limitations ( 26 ) ( 31 ) ( 15 ) Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 1,817 $ 1,305 $ 1,010 The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. Interest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 . During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as expeditiously as possible. As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months. The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2014 , and 2017 through 2020 . The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2013 through 2020 , and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2013 through 2020 . With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2012. 71 Other Taxes The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 10. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Asda Equal Value Claims Asda Stores, Ltd. (""Asda""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over 35,000 ""equal value"" claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the ""Employment Tribunal"") in the United Kingdom (""UK"") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. Asda appealed the ruling and the appeal is scheduled to be heard by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on July 14-15, 2020. Notwithstanding the appeal, claimants are now proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. National Prescription Opiate Litigation and Related Matters In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. 72 FCPA Investigation and Related Matters As previously disclosed, the Company was under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") regarding possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA""). Throughout the investigative process, the Company cooperated with the DOJ and the SEC, and on June 20, 2019, the Company announced the resolution of the investigations with the DOJ and the SEC and paid $ 283 million in June 2019 consisting of a combination of penalties, disgorgement and interest as further described below (the ""Settlement Amount""). The Company previously recorded the Settlement Amount in the Company's fiscal 2018 consolidated financial statements in anticipated settlement of these matters. The resolution of the investigations with the DOJ and SEC included: 1. A non-prosecution agreement (the ""NPA"") between the DOJ and the Company for a three-year term. Pursuant to the NPA, the Company paid a $ 138 million penalty and agreed to maintain the Company's anti-corruption compliance program for three years, certain reporting obligations for three years, and a limited monitorship with a third-party for two years regarding the Company's anti-corruption compliance program, with the possibility of a third year pending the results of the monitorship during the initial two-year period. The DOJ agreed that it will not prosecute the Company for any conduct described in the NPA provided that the Company performs its obligations under the NPA for the three-year term. 2. A plea agreement (the ""Plea Agreement"") entered into for a three-year term by the DOJ and WMT Brasilia S.a.r.l., an indirect wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of the Company (""WMT Brasilia"") that previously owned a majority stake of the Company's Brazilian business. Through the Plea Agreement, entered in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, WMT Brasilia pled guilty to one count of causing a books and records violation of the FCPA. The Company on behalf of WMT Brasilia was assessed a $ 4 million penalty, including forfeiture, that was deducted from the amount paid by the Company under the NPA. 3. A Cease-and-Desist Order entered into by the SEC in a civil administrative proceeding (the ""SEC Order""), the entry of which the Company consented to with respect to certain violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. The Company paid $ 145 million in disgorgement and interest, and agreed to make certain reports to the SEC on its anti-corruption compliance and remediation efforts for two years, and cease and desist any violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. On June 20, 2019, the Company also entered into an Administrative Agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the ""EPA"") for a three-year term, which replaces the interim administrative agreement between the Company and the EPA dated May 28, 2013. The May 28, 2013 agreement arose as part of a settlement by the Company regarding certain hazardous waste materials matters with several governmental authorities. The new EPA agreement, among other things, resolved any debarment or suspension as to participation in federal government programs by the Company due to the NPA, the Plea Agreement, and the SEC Order, provided that the Company fulfills the terms and conditions of the new EPA agreement, which requires reporting by the Company to the EPA periodically during the three-year term, and requires a new, limited two-year monitorship. The monitor referenced above that has been engaged by the Company under the NPA will also monitor compliance with the new EPA agreement. If the DOJ monitorship is extended as referenced above, the EPA monitorship may also be extended for an additional year. In addition, the Company expects to incur costs in implementing the settlement and may incur costs in responding to any new civil or regulatory actions. The Company does not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Note 11. Retirement-Related Benefits The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches 100 % of participant contributions up to 6 % of annual eligible earnings. The matching contributions immediately vest at 100 % for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50 % of their pretax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits. Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established. 73 The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 : Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Defined contribution plans: U.S. $ 1,184 $ 1,165 $ 1,124 International 177 126 126 Total contribution expense for defined contribution plans $ 1,361 $ 1,291 $ 1,250 Additionally, the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan have sponsored defined benefit pension plans. In October 2019, Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the ""Plan"") entered into an agreement pursuant to which Asda made a cash contribution of $ 1.0 billion to the Plan (the ""Asda Pension Contribution"") which enabled the Plan to purchase a bulk annuity insurance contract for the benefit of Plan participants. The agreement between Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Plan contemplates that subsequent to the purchase of the bulk annuity insurance contract by the Plan, each of the Plan participants will be issued an individual annuity contract. The issuer of the individual annuity insurance contracts will be solely responsible for paying each participant’s benefits in full and will release the Plan and Asda from any future obligations. The Company expects the issuance of individual annuity contracts to the Plan participants to take place in late fiscal 2021 or early fiscal 2022, which will trigger a pension settlement that will result in all Plan balances, including accumulated pension components within other comprehensive income, being charged to expense. The defined benefit pension plan in Japan was underfunded by $ 140 million and $ 175 million as of January 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively and recorded as a liability in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in deferred income taxes and other. Certain other international operations also have defined benefit arrangements that are not significant. Note 12. Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items The following material disposals, acquisitions and other items impact the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or been announced. Walmart Brazil In August 2018, the Company sold an 80 percent stake of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (""Advent""). Under the terms of the sale, Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax net loss of $ 4.8 billion during fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income . Substantially all of this charge was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 upon meeting the held for sale criteria. In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by $ 0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the indemnity, the Company will indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$ 2.3 billion , adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. The Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. This equity method investment was determined to have no fair value and continues to have no carrying value. Flipkart In August 2018, the Company acquired 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace , for cash consideration of approximately $ 16 billion . The acquisition increases the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company finalized the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Flipkart acquisition as follows: • Assets of $ 24.1 billion , which comprise primarily of $ 2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $ 2.8 billion in other current assets, $ 5.0 billion in intangible assets and $ 13.5 billion in goodwill. Of the intangible assets, $ 4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The remaining $ 0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily relate to acquired technology with a life of 3 years . The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale primarily related to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes; • Liabilities of $ 3.7 billion , which comprise primarily of $ 1.8 billion of current liabilities and $ 1.7 billion of deferred income taxes; and 74 • Noncontrolling interest of $ 4.3 billion , for which the fair value was estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The Company began consolidating the financial statements of Flipkart in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, using a one-month lag. To finance the acquisition, the Company used a combination of cash provided by long-term debt as discussed in Note 6 and cash on hand. The Flipkart results of operations since acquisition and the pro forma financial information are immaterial. Note 13. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company previously operated in Brazil prior to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019 discussed in Note 12 . The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in the following table: (Amounts in millions) Walmart U.S. Walmart International Sam's Club Corporate and support Consolidated Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2020 Net sales $ 341,004 $ 120,130 $ 58,792 $ — $ 519,926 Operating income (loss) 17,380 3,370 1,642 ( 1,824 ) 20,568 Interest, net ( 2,410 ) Other gains and (losses) 1,958 Income before income taxes $ 20,116 Total assets $ 110,353 $ 105,811 $ 13,494 $ 6,837 $ 236,495 Depreciation and amortization 6,408 2,682 605 1,292 10,987 Capital expenditures 6,315 2,801 525 1,064 10,705 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019 Net sales $ 331,666 $ 120,824 $ 57,839 $ — $ 510,329 Operating income (loss) 17,386 4,883 1,520 ( 1,832 ) 21,957 Interest, net ( 2,129 ) Other gains and (losses) ( 8,368 ) Income before income taxes $ 11,460 Total assets $ 105,114 $ 97,066 $ 12,893 $ 4,222 $ 219,295 Depreciation and amortization 6,201 2,590 639 1,248 10,678 Capital expenditures 6,034 2,661 450 1,199 10,344 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018 Net sales $ 318,477 $ 118,068 $ 59,216 $ — $ 495,761 Operating income (loss) 16,995 5,229 915 ( 2,702 ) 20,437 Interest, net ( 2,178 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt ( 3,136 ) Income before income taxes $ 15,123 Total assets $ 104,347 $ 81,549 $ 13,418 $ 5,208 $ 204,522 Depreciation and amortization 6,005 2,601 698 1,225 10,529 Capital expenditures 5,680 2,607 626 1,138 10,051 75 Total revenues, consisting of net sales and membership and other income, and long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, net and lease right-of-use assets, aggregated by the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. operations for fiscal 2020 , 2019 and 2018 , are as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Revenues U.S. operations $ 402,532 $ 392,265 $ 380,580 Non-U.S. operations 121,432 122,140 119,763 Total revenues $ 523,964 $ 514,405 $ 500,343 Long-lived assets U.S. operations $ 86,944 $ 81,144 $ 81,478 Non-U.S. operations 40,105 30,251 33,340 Total long-lived assets $ 127,049 $ 111,395 $ 114,818 No individual country outside of the U.S. had total revenues or long-lived assets that were material to the consolidated totals.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020 . In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (""COSO"") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2020 . The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020 , has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report which appears herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

BUSINESS General Walmart Inc. (""Walmart,"" the ""Company"" or ""we"") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve nearly 275 million customers who visit our more than 11,300 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 58 banners in 27 countries. Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (""EDLP""). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost (""EDLC"") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers. Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019 ""), January 31, 2018 (""fiscal 2018 "") and January 31, 2017 (""fiscal 2017 ""). During fiscal 2019 , we generated total revenues of $514.4 billion , which was primarily comprised of net sales of $510.3 billion . We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""WMT."" The Development of Our Company Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expanded and, as of January 31, 2019 , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 26 countries. In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating walmart.com. That same year, we also created samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. In 2016, we acquired jet.com in the U.S. and formed a strategic alliance with JD.com in China. Since the jet.com purchase, we have continued to expand our U.S. eCommerce capabilities through acquisitions including Shoes.com, Moosejaw, Bonobos and other digital consumer brands. In 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping on more than 2 million items and we created Store N o 8, a technology incubator with a focus to drive commerce forward. In fiscal 2019, we acquired a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart""), an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace , with an ecosystem that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart, Myntra and Jabong. In the U.S., we added more grocery pickup and delivery locations and as of January 31, 2019, we offered grocery pickup at more than 2,100 locations and grocery delivery at nearly 800 locations. Our eCommerce efforts and innovation have led to omni-channel offerings in many of our markets. We are building an ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, services, eCommerce sites, supply chain and more than 2.2 million associates to better serve our customers. Information About Our Segments We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil prior to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil discussed in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. We define our segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We sell similar individual products and services in each of our segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. 7 We measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In fiscal 2019, we revised certain of our corporate overhead allocations to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability. Walmart U.S. Segment Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the ""Walmart"" and ""Walmart Neighborhood Market"" brands, as well as walmart.com, jet.com and other eCommerce brands. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $331.7 billion for fiscal 2019 , representing 65% of our fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $318.5 billion and $307.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate""). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income. Omni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce , through services such as ""Walmart Pickup,"" ""Pickup Today"", ""Grocery Pickup"", ""Grocery Delivery,"" and ""Endless Aisle."" As of January 31, 2019, we had over 2,100 Grocery Pickup locations and nearly 800 Grocery Delivery locations. Our eCommerce websites include walmart.com, jet.com and others. The following table provides the approximate size of our retail stores as of January 31, 2019 : Minimum Square Feet Maximum Square Feet Average Square Feet Supercenters (general merchandise and grocery) 69,000 260,000 178,000 Discount stores (general merchandise and limited grocery) 30,000 206,000 105,000 Neighborhood markets (1) (grocery) 28,000 65,000 42,000 (1) Excludes other small formats.

Walmart U.S. does business in three strategic merchandise units, listed below: • Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including meat, produce, natural & organics, deli & bakery, dairy, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral and dry grocery, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, baby products, household chemicals, paper goods and pet supplies; • Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical services, clinical services, and over-the-counter drugs and other medical products; 8 • General merchandise includes: ◦ Entertainment (e.g., electronics, cameras and supplies, photo processing services, wireless, movies, music, video games and books); ◦ Hardlines (e.g., stationery, automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and horticulture); ◦ Apparel (e.g., apparel for women, girls, men, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and ◦ Home/Seasonal (e.g., home furnishings, housewares and small appliances, bedding, home decor, toys, fabrics and crafts and seasonal merchandise). Walmart U.S. also offers fuel and financial services and related products, including money orders, prepaid cards, wire transfers, money transfers, check cashing and bill payment. These services total less than 1% of annual net sales. Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private-label brands, including brands such as: ""Athletic Works,"" ""Bonobos,"" ""Equate,"" ""Everstart,"" ""George,"" ""Great Value,"" ""Holiday Time,"" ""Mainstays,"" ""Marketside,"" ""ModCloth,"" ""No Boundaries,"" ""Onn,"" ""Ozark Trail,"" ""Parent's Choice,"" ""Time and Tru"" and ""Wonder Nation."" The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: ""Better Homes & Gardens,"" ""Farberware,"" ""Russell"" and ""SwissTech."" Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability. Operations. Many supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets are open 24 hours each day. A variety of payment methods are accepted. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, as well as eCommerce retailers. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following: • EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity; • EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; and • Omni-channel offerings such as Walmart Pickup, where a customer places an order online and picks it up for free from a store; Pickup Today, where a customer places an order online and picks it up for free from a store; Grocery Delivery, where a customer places a grocery order online and has it delivered; or Grocery Pickup, where a customer places a grocery order online and picks it up at one of our participating stores or remote locations. Distribution. For fiscal 2019 , approximately 77% of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through our 156 distribution facilities, which are located strategically throughout the U.S. The remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 33 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers. Walmart International Segment Walmart International is our second largest segment and operates in 26 countries outside of the U.S. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil prior to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil discussed in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements; and our majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua), India and Mexico. Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, asda.com, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. 9 Walmart International had net sales of $120.8 billion for fiscal 2019 , representing 24% of our fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $118.1 billion and $116.1 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The segment's net sales have been negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. To deliver strong efficient growth, we have to be decisive when it comes to our capital and our time. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to reposition Walmart International, including: • Acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018 for $16 billion, or $13.8 billion net of cash acquired. We began consolidating Flipkart's results in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, using a one-month lag . The ongoing operations negatively impacted fiscal 2019 net income and this negative impact will continue in fiscal 2020. • Proposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited (""Asda""), our wholly-owned United Kingdom retail subsidiary. Under the terms, we would receive approximately 42 percent of the share capital of the combined company and approximately £3.0 billion in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, while retaining obligations under the Asda defined benefit pension plan . Due to a complex regulatory review process, the outcome of which is uncertain and may take some time to complete, the held for sale classification criteria for the disposal group has not been met as of January 31, 2019. Further, there can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approval will be obtained or the proposed combination will be consummated. In the future, if the held for sale classification criteria is met for the disposal group, we expect to recognize a loss, the amount of which may fluctuate based on the changes in the value of share capital received and foreign exchange rates. • Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (“Advent”) in August 2018. Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and we agreed to indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters. We recorded a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019 for the sale, of which $2.0 billion related to cumulative foreign currency translation loss which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss. • Consistent with our focus on core retail capabilities, the divestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the proposed divestiture of the Walmart Canada banking operations , classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2019 . Omni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce , such as through services like ""Click & Collect"" in the United Kingdom, our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets, and our marketplaces, such as Flipkart in India. Generally, retail units range in size from 1,500 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores generally range in size from 25,000 square feet to 155,000 square feet. Other includes stand-alone gas stations operating in the United Kingdom, which range in size up to 2,200 square feet.

(4) Central America unit counts by country are Costa Rica ( 256 ), El Salvador ( 97 ), Guatemala ( 250 ), Honduras ( 105 ) and Nicaragua ( 103 ). Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as ""Equate,"" ""George,"" ""Great Value,"" ""Holiday Time,"" ""Mainstays,"" ""Marketside,"" and ""Parent's Choice,"" our international markets have developed market specific brands including ""Aurrera,"" ""Cambridge,"" ""Lider,"" ""Myntra,"" ""Jabong,"" ""PhonePe,"" and ""Extra Special."" In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices. Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods. Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns. Competition. Walmart International competes with omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. 11 Distribution. We utilize a total of 226 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2019 , approximately 83% of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 90 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as more than 1,900 eCommerce sort centers in India. Sam's Club Segment Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club had net sales of $57.8 billion for fiscal 2019 , representing 11% of our consolidated fiscal 2019 net sales, and had net sales of $59.2 billion and $57.4 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments. Membership. The following two options are available to members: Plus Membership Club Membership Annual Membership Fee $100 $45 Number of Add-on Memberships ($40 each) Up to 16 Up to 8 Eligible for Cash Rewards Yes No All memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost. Plus Members are eligible for Cash Rewards, which is a benefit that provides $10 for every $500 in qualifying Sam's Club purchases up to a $500 cash reward annually. The amount earned can be used for purchases, membership fees or redeemed for cash. Plus Members are also eligible for Free Shipping on the majority of merchandise, with no minimum order size, and receive discounts on prescriptions, glasses and contacts. Omni-channel. While Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club, it provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce . The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 34,000 and 168,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet. The following table provides the retail unit count and retail square feet for the fiscal years shown : Fiscal Year Opened Closed Total (1) Square Feet (1) Balance forward 632 84,382 2015 16 (1 ) 647 86,510 2016 8 — 655 87,552 2017 9 (4 ) 660 88,376 2018 4 (67 ) 597 80,068 2019 2 599 80,240 (1) ""Total"" and ""Square Feet"" columns are as of January 31 for the fiscal years shown. ""Square Feet"" column is reported in thousands. Members have access to a broad assortment of merchandise, including products not found in our clubs, and services online at samsclub.com and through our mobile commerce applications, providing the option of delivery direct-to-home or to the club through services such as ""Club Pickup."" Sam's Club omni-channel capabilities also include ""Scan and Go,"" a mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line. Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories: • Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items; • Fuel and other categories consists of gasoline stations, tobacco, tools and power equipment, and tire and battery centers; • Home and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, grills, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, housewares, toys, seasonal items, mattresses and small appliances; • Technology, office and entertainment includes electronics, wireless, software, video games, movies, books, music, office supplies, office furniture, photo processing and third-party gift cards; and • Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services and over-the-counter drugs. The Member's Mark brand continues to expand assortment and deliver member value. In fiscal 2019 , Member's Mark sales exceeded $12 billion, driven by growth across multiple categories in the private brand portfolio. Operations. Operating hours for Sam's Clubs are generally Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, all club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m. A variety of payment methods are accepted. 12 Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete. Distribution. During fiscal 2019 , approximately 70% of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from Sam's Club's 23 dedicated distribution facilities, located strategically throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's club purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from its six dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers, including two dedicated import facilities. The principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise while minimizing stored inventory. Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour. Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties. Suppliers and Supply Chain As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United States, from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the ""fresh"" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of a number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members. Employees As of the end of fiscal 2019 , Walmart Inc. and our subsidiaries employed more than 2.2 million employees (""associates"") worldwide, with 1.5 million associates in the U.S. and 0.7 million associates internationally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates. We believe our relationships with our associates are good. A large number of associates turn over each year, although Walmart U.S. turnover has improved in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 as a result of our focus on increasing wages and providing improved tools, technology and training to associates. Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S. we offer a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates. These include a store discount card or Sam's Club membership, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of associate purchases of our stock through our Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance. In addition to the health-care benefits for eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S., we offer maternity leave and a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates. We also offer a $5,000 benefit to assist eligible associates with adoption. Additionally, we offer eligible associates tuition assistance towards earning a college degree. Similarly, in the 13 operations outside the U.S., we provide a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.

RISK FACTORS The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Strategic Risks General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets. In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. 15 A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See "" Item 1. Business "" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments. Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Other segments are substantially reducing operations which could also result in competition rushing to fill the void created by such corporate actions. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, or reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated or aligned companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and the growth of our business. Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our increasing eCommerce investments may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance. The retail business is rapidly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping digitally. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate. Our strategy, which includes acquisitions, joint ventures, investments in eCommerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this Item 1A . As a result, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected, which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance. Furthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term. The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our retail operations. These arrangements may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance or business relationship could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Operational Risks Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a 16 country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S. Political and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet certain of our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. In addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our financial performance. If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We may also face reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms. Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and may also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. The applicability to us of laws related to such sales is currently unsettled and we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are counterfeit or otherwise fraudulent. We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations. Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors. Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. Our information systems are not fully 17 redundant and if our systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating our information technology processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our eCommerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected. Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media and electronic mail to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer ""Walmart Pickup,"" ""Pickup Today,"" ""Club Pickup"" and ""Online Grocery"" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. (whether through organic growth or eCommerce acquisitions) and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the computer and operating systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers' or members' payment information and related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business. Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results. As do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single ""hackers"" or small groups of ""hackers."" Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. As cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors. 18 Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. We or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs. Any breach of our security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers, members, associates and vendors whose personal data was compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any cyber-attack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain circumstances, payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us. Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (""PBMs""). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations; further consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the repeal of 19 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business. If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies. One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Financial Risks Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations. Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations. We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies. Additionally, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock. 20 Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance. In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. During fiscal 2019, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also sources goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions on eCommerce offerings in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. Our business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by increases in food costs, changes in trade policies, changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws and fluctuations in currency exchange rates resulting from the UK's pending exit from the European Union. We expect continued uncertainty around the extent of the impact of this exit on our business until the UK and the European Union put in alternative trade and other arrangements. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations. In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance. In fiscal 2019, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales. The federal government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business. We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. 21 For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act"") significantly changed income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations and there are aspects of the Tax Act that remain unclear as additional guidance from the U.S. tax authority is pending. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. In addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made. Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance. We operate in complex regulated environments in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Our pharmacy operations in the United States are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act, laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the ""FDA"") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the ""DEA""), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services. For example, in the United States the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition, and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the United States. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available, such as our money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws. 22 In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. (""Asda""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in numerous ""equal value"" claims pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal (the ""Employment Tribunal"") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former Asda store employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters . In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims. We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption "" Item 3. Legal Proceedings "" and in Note 10 in the "" Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements ,"" which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter. As previously disclosed, we are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. We have been cooperating with those agencies and discussions have been ongoing with them regarding the resolution of these matters. These discussions have progressed to a point that in fiscal 2018, we reasonably estimated a probable loss and recorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to these matters (the ""Accrual""). A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico also investigated these matters. Walmex cooperated with the Mexican governmental agencies that conducted these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation were filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and former officers and certain of Walmex's former officers. These matters have been resolved or immaterial accruals have been made for proposed settlements. We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. Shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that there will be ongoing media and governmental interest regarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception among certain audiences of our role as a corporate citizen. Moreover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and with respect to investigations. While we have made an Accrual for these matters, because the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters. Although we do not presently believe that these matters, including the Accrual (and the payment of the Accrual at some point-in-time in the future) will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future.

The case citations for the state cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit in which the complaint closely tracks the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in The New York Times (the ""Times"") on April 21, 2012. This is a securities lawsuit, City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , USDC, Western Dist. of AR, that was filed on May 7, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and has sought damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock. On September 20, 2016, the court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On October 6, 2016, the defendants filed a petition to appeal the class certification ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On November 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied the Company's petition. On October 26, 2018, the parties filed a motion asking the court to approve a proposed settlement under which the Company would pay $160 million (the “Settlement Amount”) to resolve the claims of all class members. On December 6, 2018, the court preliminarily approved the settlement and scheduled the final approval hearing for April 4, 2019. The settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by the Company or any defendant. The Settlement Amount was expensed in the Company’s fiscal 2019 financial statements. Securities Class Action : City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., USDC, Western Dist. of AR; 5/7/12. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In September 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified the Company that it had initiated an administrative penalty action by issuing a Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order. The letter accompanying the Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order alleges that the Company distributed and/or sold three unregistered pesticide products from March 1, 2017 through June 23, 2017. The EPA is seeking a penalty of $960,000. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for ensuring that a FIFRA-regulated product is properly registered prior to its sale. The Company is cooperating with the EPA. In January 2018, the Environmental Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuraduría Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of approximately $163,000 for the absence of an Environmental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company is challenging the fine. 26 In April 2017, the California Air Resources Board (the ""ARB"") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimed deposits collected on sales of small containers of automotive refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs. The ARB alleged that the Company had improperly retained approximately $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and has sought reimbursement. The Company has denied any wrongdoing. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019 ""), January 31, 2018 (""fiscal 2018 "") and January 31, 2017 (""fiscal 2017 "") should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. In fiscal 2019, the Company revised certain of its corporate overhead allocations, including depreciation expense, to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability . Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or though mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Generally, our highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 . We made certain strategic portfolio decisions, further discussed in Item 1. Business , which include the following: • Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart"") in August 2018. The ongoing operations negatively impacted fiscal 2019 net income and this negative impact will continue in fiscal 2020. • Proposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited (""Asda""), where we would receive approximately 42 percent of the share capital of the combined company, however, the held for sale criteria has not been met as of January 31, 2019. Further, there can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approval will be obtained or the proposed combination will be consummated. In the future, if the held for sale classification criteria is met for the disposal group, we expect to recognize a loss, the amount of which may fluctuate based on the changes in the value of share capital received and foreign exchange rates. • Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (""Advent"") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019. • Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile in December 2018 and the proposed divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Canada, classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2019. 30 The Retail Industry We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We also compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under "" Item 1A. Risk Factors ,"" and under "" Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements ."" Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , were as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 3.7% 2.1% 0.1% 0.1% Sam's Club 5.4% 2.8% 1.6% 1.0% Total U.S. 4.0% 2.2% 0.4% 0.2% Walmart U.S. comparable sales increased 3.7% and 2.1% in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, driven by ticket and traffic growth. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 , respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers . Sam's Club comparable sales increased 5.4% and 2.8% in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Sam's Club fiscal 2019 comparable sales were driven by strong traffic, which was aided by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs and fuel sales. These increases were partially offset by reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations in fiscal 2019 . Sam's Club fiscal 2018 comp sales were driven by strong traffic and fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.9% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 31 Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 Net sales $ 510,329 $ 495,761 Percentage change from comparable period 2.9 % 3.0 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 107,147 $ 106,510 Percentage change from comparable period 0.6 % 4.6 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.0 % 21.5 % For fiscal 2019 , operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping fiscal 2018 charges discussed in the following paragraph . The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit . For fiscal 2018, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Club closures and discontinued real estate projects, $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, the legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA matter, a charge of $244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in Walmart U.S. and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. Strategic Capital Allocation We are allocating more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years. This allocation aligns with our initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers . Total fiscal 2019 capital expenditures increased slightly compared to the prior year; the following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Fiscal Years Ended January 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2019 2018 eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other 5,218 4,521 Remodels 2,152 2,009 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations $ 313 $ 914 Total U.S. 7,683 7,444 Walmart International 2,661 2,607 Total capital expenditures $ 10,344 $ 10,051 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 3.4% and 5.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. For fiscal 2019 , the decline in ROA was primarily due to the decrease in consolidated net income resulting from the $4.5 billion net loss related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and also the $2.8 billion net unrealized loss on our JD.com investment. For fiscal 2018 , the decline in ROA was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income. ROI was 14.2% for fiscal 2019 , which was flat compared to fiscal 2018 . 32 We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. In addition, we include a factor of 8 for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. Beginning in fiscal 2020, our calculation of ROI will change upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases , primarily to replace the factor of 8 for rent expense with US GAAP operating lease assets. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 7,179 $ 10,523 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 211,909 $ 201,674 Return on assets (ROA) 3.4 % 5.2 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 21,957 $ 20,437 + Interest income 217 152 + Depreciation and amortization 10,678 10,529 + Rent 3,004 2,932 = Adjusted operating income $ 35,856 $ 34,050 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 211,909 $ 201,674 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 85,107 79,995 - Average accounts payable (1) 46,576 43,763 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 22,141 21,388 + Rent x 8 24,032 23,456 = Average invested capital $ 252,331 $ 239,974 Return on investment (ROI) 14.2 % 14.2 % As of January 31, 2019 2018 2017 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 219,295 $ 204,522 $ 198,825 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 87,175 83,039 76,951 Accounts payable 47,060 46,092 41,433 Accrued liabilities 22,159 22,122 20,654 (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $27.8 billion , $28.3 billion and $31.7 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. We generated free cash flow of $17.4 billion , $18.3 billion and $21.1 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 (""Tax Reform"") and the timing of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures . The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2018 from fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . 33 Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 27,753 $ 28,337 $ 31,673 Payments for property and equipment (10,344 ) (10,051 ) (10,619 ) Free cash flow $ 17,409 $ 18,286 $ 21,054 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (24,036 ) $ (9,079 ) $ (13,896 ) Net cash used in financing activities (2,537 ) (19,875 ) (19,072 ) (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2017 Total revenues $ 514,405 $ 500,343 $ 485,873 Percentage change from comparable period 2.8 % 3.0 % 0.8 % Net sales $ 510,329 $ 495,761 $ 481,317 Percentage change from comparable period 2.9 % 3.0 % 0.6 % Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 4.0 % 2.2 % 1.4 % Gross profit rate 24.5 % 24.7 % 24.9 % Operating income $ 21,957 $ 20,437 $ 22,764 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.3 % 4.1 % 4.7 % Consolidated net income $ 7,179 $ 10,523 $ 14,293 Unit counts at period end 11,361 11,718 11,695 Retail square feet at period end 1,129 1,158 1,164 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $14.1 billion or 2.8% and $14.5 billion or 3.0% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Net sales increased $14.6 billion or 2.9% and $14.4 billion or 3.0% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our International markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, for fiscal 2019 , the increase in net sales was partially offset by a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales due to club closures in the Sam's Club segment during fiscal 2018 , a $ 3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in the International segment, and $0.7 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates . For fiscal 2018 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales, the impact from new store openings and sales generated from eCommerce acquisitions. The positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses and the $0.5 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our gross profit rate decreased 18 and 26 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was due to the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business, the consolidation of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expenses. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. Membership and other income decreased for fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to the prior year recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia in our International Segment. Membership and other income was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. While fiscal 2018 included a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia, along with a $47 million gain from a land sale, higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and higher membership income from increased Plus Member penetration at Sam's Club, these gains were offset by gains recognized in fiscal 2017 . For fiscal 2019 , operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping fiscal 2018 charges discussed in the following paragraph . The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit . For fiscal 2018, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Club closures and discontinued real estate projects, $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, the legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA matter, a charge of $244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in Walmart U.S. and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. Other losses were $8.4 billion for fiscal 2019 , primarily the result of the $4.8 billion pre-tax loss on the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and a $3.5 billion pre-tax decrease in the market value of our investment in JD.com. Fiscal 2018 results included loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.1 billion . Our effective income tax rate was 37.4% for fiscal 2019 , 30.4% for fiscal 2018 , and 30.3% for fiscal 2017 . Although the U.S. statutory rate was lowered due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act""), our effective income tax rate increased in fiscal 2019 primarily because we recognized minimal tax benefit related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and Flipkart's results. Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 is presented in Note 9 in the "" Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ."" As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $7.2 billion and $10.5 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, which represents a decrease of $3.3 billion and $3.8 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart (""EPS"") was $2.26 , $3.28 and $4.38 for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. 34 Walmart U.S. Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2017 Net sales $ 331,666 $ 318,477 $ 307,833 Percentage change from comparable period 4.1 % 3.5 % 3.2 % Calendar comparable sales increase 3.7 % 2.1 % 1.6 % Operating income $ 17,386 $ 16,995 $ 17,012 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.2 % 5.3 % 5.5 % Unit counts at period end 4,769 4,761 4,672 Retail square feet at period end 705 705 699 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $13.2 billion or 4.1% and $10.6 billion or 3.5% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 3.7% and 2.1% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, driven by ticket and traffic growth. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018 . Additionally, for fiscal 2018 , year-over-year growth in retail square feet further contributed to the year-over-year increase. Gross profit rate decreased 28 and 24 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy, increased transportation expenses, and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. Partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018 was the positive impact of savings from procuring merchandise. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 23 basis points for fiscal 2019 and was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and the prior year comparable period including charges related to discontinued real estate projects of $244 million. These improvements more than offset investments in eCommerce, technology and omni-channel initiatives and raising the starting wage rate at the beginning of fiscal 2019. As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $391 million for fiscal 2019 and was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2017 Net sales $ 120,824 $ 118,068 $ 116,119 Percentage change from comparable period 2.3 % 1.7 % (5.9 )% Operating income $ 4,883 $ 5,229 $ 5,737 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.0 % 4.4 % 4.9 % Unit counts at period end 5,993 6,360 6,363 Retail square feet at period end 344 373 377 Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $2.8 billion or 2.3% and $1.9 billion or 1.7% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. These increases were partially offset by a $ 3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil , a $0.7 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates , the continued wind down of our first party Brazil eCommerce operations and a reduction in net sales of $140 million due to divesting our Suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sales was due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and the impact of new stores, partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses and a $0.5 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Gross profit rate decreased 41 and 28 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was due to Flipkart and strategic price investments in certain markets. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily due to strategic price investments in certain markets. Membership and other income decreased 22.4% and 14.0% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was due to the prior year recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia. While fiscal 2018 included the $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia and a $47 million gain from a land sale, these gains were less than gains recognized in fiscal 2017 , which included a $535 million gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile . 35 Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 37 basis points for fiscal 2019 and was flat for 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to impairment charges in the previous fiscal year of approximately $0.5 billion, which included charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations; this decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by the addition of operating expenses from Flipkart in fiscal 2019 . While fiscal 2018 was benefited by an increase in net sales, this benefit was offset by restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets of approximately $0.5 billion, including charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations . As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $346 million and $508 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Sam's Club Segment Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2017 Including Fuel Net sales $ 57,839 $ 59,216 $ 57,365 Percentage change from comparable period (2.3 )% 3.2 % 0.9 % Calendar comparable sales increase 5.4 % 2.8 % 0.5 % Operating income $ 1,520 $ 915 $ 1,628 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.6 % 1.5 % 2.8 % Unit counts at period end 599 597 660 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 88 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 52,332 $ 54,456 $ 53,289 Percentage change from comparable period (3.9 )% 2.2 % 1.8 % Operating income $ 1,383 $ 797 $ 1,576 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.6 % 1.5 % 3.0 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment decreased $1.4 billion or 2.3% for fiscal 2019 and increased $1.9 billion or 3.2% for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was primarily due to a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales resulting from the net closure of 63 clubs during fiscal 2018 , as well as reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations. These decreases were partially offset by increases in comparable sales, which were benefited by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.9% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 . Additional fuel sales of $0.7 billion partially offset the decreases in net sales for fiscal 2019 . For fiscal 2018 , the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales which were benefited by an increase of $0.7 billion in fuel sales from higher fuel prices. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2018 . Gross profit rate was relatively flat for fiscal 2019 and decreased 44 basis points for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , gross profit rate was benefited by lapping the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures in fiscal 2018 and decreased tobacco sales in fiscal 2019 , which have lower margins. This benefit to the gross profit rate was offset by higher transportation costs and eCommerce shipping costs, investments in price and increased shrink in fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures, a reclassification of certain supply expenses from operating expenses to cost of goods sold, increased shrink, increased eCommerce shipping costs and the investment in cash rewards. Membership and other income increased 2.6% and 2.3% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the increase was due to an increase of 1.5% in membership income resulting from increased Plus Member penetration and gains on property sales. These increases were partially offset by lower recycling income when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in membership and other income was primarily due to higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and an increase of 1.3% in membership income resulting from increased Plus Member penetration. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 99 basis points for fiscal 2019 and increased 83 basis points for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately $0.6 billion in the prior year's comparable period related to club closures and discontinued real estate projects. This charge resulted in the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales in fiscal 2018 . 36 As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $605 million for fiscal 2019 and decreased $713 million f or fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 27,753 $ 28,337 $ 31,673 Net cash provided by operating activities was $27.8 billion , $28.3 billion and $31.7 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from Tax Reform and the timing of tax payments . The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Cash and cash equivalents were $7.7 billion and $6.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Our working capital deficit was $15.6 billion and $18.9 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. The decreased working capital deficit as of January 31, 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher current assets as a result of the consolidation of Flipkart. Historically, we have used intercompany financing arrangements to make cash available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. During fiscal 2019, we repatriated to the U.S. $5.3 billion of cash at a tax cost of approximately $40 million . As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , cash and cash equivalents of $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 , approximately $1.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Net cash used in investing activities $ (24,036 ) $ (9,079 ) $ (13,896 ) Net cash used in investing activities was $24.0 billion , $9.1 billion and $13.9 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and generally consisted of payments for business acquisitions and to expand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other technologies, remodel existing stores and club and add new stores and clubs. Net cash used in investing activities increased $15.0 billion for fiscal 2019 when compared to the previous fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to the $13.8 billion payment for Flipkart , net of cash acquired, as well as payments for other, smaller acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4.8 billion for fiscal 2018 when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2018 included cash received of $1.0 billion from the sale of Suburbia in Mexico, while fiscal 2017 included our acquisition of Jet.com, Inc. (""jet.com"") for $2.4 billion and our purchase of $1.9 billion of shares in JD.com (""JD""). Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD. Additionally, refer to the "" Strategic Capital Allocation "" section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2019 and 2018 . 37 Growth Activities For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020 ""), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $11.0 billion. In fiscal 2020 , we expect to add approximately 300 new stores in Walmart International, primarily in Mexico, Central America and China, and add less than 10 stores in Walmart U.S. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Net cash used in financing activities $ (2,537 ) $ (19,875 ) $ (19,072 ) Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Fiscal 2019 net cash used in financing activities decreased $17.3 billion when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to the $15.9 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart and for general corporate purposes, as well as a decrease in share repurchases due to the suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the Flipkart announcement. Fiscal 2018 net cash used in financing activities increased $0.8 billion for fiscal 2018 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to premiums paid for early extinguishment of debt. Further discussion of financing activities is provided by major categories below. Short-term Borrowings Net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings were relatively flat in fiscal 2019 and increased $4.1 billion in fiscal 2018 , when compared to the balance at the end of the previous fiscal year. We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. For fiscal 2018 , the additional cash provided by short-term borrowings was primarily due to the timing of our January 2018 debt extinguishment. The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end $ 13,389 $ 11,386 $ 9,493 Average daily short-term borrowings 10,625 8,131 5,691 Annual weighted-average interest rate 2.4 % 1.3 % 1.8 % In addition to our short-term borrowings, we have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.8 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. , as of January 31, 2019 , that provide additional liquidity, if needed. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2019 : (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2018 $ 3,738 $ 30,045 $ 33,783 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 15,872 15,872 Payments of long-term debt (3,763 ) (21 ) (3,784 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 1,864 (1,864 ) — Other 37 (512 ) (475 ) Balances as of January 31, 2019 $ 1,876 $ 43,520 $ 45,396 Our total long-term debt increased $11.6 billion for fiscal 2019 , primarily due to the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for Flipkart and for general corporate purposes . 38 Dividends Our total dividend payments were $6.1 billion , $6.1 billion and $6.2 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Board of Directors approved, effective February 19, 2019 , the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $2.12 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2019 annual dividend of $2.08 per share. For fiscal 2020 , the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.53 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 15, 2019 April 1, 2019 May 10, 2019 June 3, 2019 August 9, 2019 September 3, 2019 December 6, 2019 January 2, 2020 Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal 2019 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of January 31, 2019 , authorization for $11.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 2017 Total number of shares repurchased 79.5 104.9 119.9 Average price paid per share $ 93.18 $ 79.11 $ 69.18 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 7,410 $ 8,296 $ 8,298 Share repurchases decreased for fiscal 2019 and were relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was due to the suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the announcement of the Flipkart acquisition. Repurchases of Company stock returned to a more normalized level in the latter half of fiscal 2019. Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2019 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. 39 Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations to make contractual future payments, such as debt and lease agreements, and certain contingent commitments as of January 31, 2019 : Payments Due During Fiscal Years Ending January 31, (Amounts in millions) Total 2020 2021-2022 2023-2024 Thereafter Recorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt (1) $ 45,396 $ 1,876 $ 8,427 $ 7,439 $ 27,654 Short-term borrowings 5,225 5,225 — — — Capital lease and financing obligations (2) 9,896 917 1,650 1,260 6,069 Unrecorded contractual obligations: Non-cancelable operating leases (3) 14,118 1,856 3,075 2,296 6,891 Estimated interest on long-term debt 23,039 1,745 3,219 2,851 15,224 Syndicated and other letters of credit 2,180 2,180 — — — Purchase obligations 14,343 7,325 4,249 1,441 1,328 Total contractual obligations $ 114,197 $ 21,124 $ 20,620 $ 15,287 $ 57,166 (1) ""Long-term debt"" includes the fair value of our derivatives designated as fair value hedges. (2) ""Capital lease and financing obligations"" represents undiscounted aggregate minimum annual rentals, which are recorded on the balance sheet at present value. Refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. (3) Represents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of January 31, 2019 . Under the terms of the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil, we agreed to indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion , adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. As of January 31, 2019 , the indemnification liability recorded was $0.8 billion and included in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, we have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.8 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2019 , and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate debt. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. For the purposes of the above table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the table above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. The expected timing for payment discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $1.3 billion of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities. The timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of January 31, 2019 , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 40 Other Matters We discuss our existing FCPA investigation and related matters and possible effects of those matters on Walmart's business, including certain risks arising therefrom, in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the caption ""Risk Factors"" and under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings"" in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" and appears elsewhere herein.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates. Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. Inventories We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. Impairment of Assets We evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which included full impairment of all related-assets, there were no other material impairment charges for fiscal 2019. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2019 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment. For fiscal 2018, although impairment charges were $1.4 billion, these charges primarily related to restructuring activities described in Note 14 , as well as discontinued real estate projects in the U.S. and decisions to exit certain international properties . Impairment charges not related to restructuring activities or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were not material. 41 Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2019 , our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. For approximately $300 million of certain acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value approximated the carrying value; any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies heavily on estimates. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act"") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard–setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. 42 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of our equity investment in JD.com. The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2019 , the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased $13 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates. The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2019 . Expected Maturity Date (Amounts in millions) Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 Thereafter Total Liabilities Short-term borrowings: Variable rate $ 5,225 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 5,225 Weighted-average interest rate 2.7 % — % — % — % — % — % 2.7 % Long-term debt (1) : Fixed rate $ 1,576 $ 4,597 $ 2,330 $ 2,844 $ 4,595 $ 27,654 $ 43,596 Weighted-average interest rate 2.5 % 2.9 % 3.7 % 1.7 % 3.2 % 4.5 % 3.9 % Variable rate $ 300 $ 750 $ 750 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,800 Weighted-average interest rate 2.8 % 2.9 % 3.1 % — % — % — % 2.9 % Interest rate derivatives Interest rate swaps: Fixed to variable $ — $ 750 $ — $ — $ 1,750 $ 1,500 $ 4,000 Weighted-average pay rate — % 4.1 % — % — % 3.2 % 3.8 % 3.6 % Weighted-average receive rate — % 3.3 % — % — % 2.6 % 3.3 % 3.0 % (1) The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives classified as fair value hedges. As of January 31, 2019 , our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 22% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2019 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $110 million . Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S, as well our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt. For fiscal 2019 , movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in the UK, Chile, and Canada were the primary cause of the $2.1 billion loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss. We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in an asset position of $62 million and $413 million as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in fiscal 2019 . A hypothetical 10% change in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate as of January 31, 2019 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $515 million . A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2019 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $13 million . 43 In addition to currency swaps, we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of our foreign operations. We had outstanding long-term debt of £1.7 billion as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in the United Kingdom. As of January 31, 2019 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $201 million . In addition, we had outstanding long-term debt of ¥180 billion as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in Japan. As of January 31, 2019 , a hypothetical 10% change in value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $150 million . In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies. Investment Risk We are exposed to changes in the JD.com (""JD"") stock price as a result of our equity investment in JD. Since February 1, 2018, when we adopted the new financial instrument accounting standard, the change in fair value recorded within other gains and losses resulted in a loss of $3.5 billion due to a decrease in the stock price of JD. As of January 31, 2019 , the fair value of our equity investment in JD was $3.6 billion . 44 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""consolidated financial statements""). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 28, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Adoption of ASU No. 2016-01 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of measuring certain equity investments to fair value and recognizing the change in fair value in net income effective February 1, 2018, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Topic 825) . Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 1969. Rogers, Arkansas March 28, 2019 46 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Flipkart Private Limited (“Flipkart”), except for the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets that were included in management’s assessment. Flipkart is included in the 2019 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 2% of the Company’s total assets as of January 31, 2019 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded and approximately 1% of the Company’s net sales for the year ended January 31, 2019. Accordingly, our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Flipkart, except for the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2019 , and the related notes and our report dated March 28, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Rogers, Arkansas March 28, 2019 47 Walmart Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies General Walmart Inc. (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers. Each week, the Company serves over 275 million customers who visit its more than 11,300 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 58 banners in 27 countries. The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019 ""), January 31, 2018 (""fiscal 2018 "") and January 31, 2017 (""fiscal 2017 ""). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2019 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Substantially all of the Company's $7.7 billion and $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 were held outside of the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations. The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. During fiscal 2019, the Company repatriated to the U.S. $5.3 billion of cash at a tax cost of approximately $40 million . As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 , approximately $1.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart"") minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Restricted Cash In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows–Restricted Cash (Topic 230) , which requires restricted cash to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018. Restricted cash held outside of cash and cash equivalents was $34 million as of January 31, 2019 , primarily recorded in prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and $300 million as of January 31, 2018 , primarily recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 53 Receivables Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales; banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process; governments for income taxes; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and real estate transactions. Inventories The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (""FIFO"") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale represent components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Company's financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. The Company reviews all businesses and assets held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , immaterial amounts for assets and liabilities held for sale were classified in prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis: As of January 31, (Amounts in millions) Estimated Useful Lives 2019 2018 Land N/A $ 24,526 $ 25,298 Buildings and improvements 3-40 years 101,006 101,155 Fixtures and equipment 1-30 years 54,488 52,695 Transportation equipment 3-15 years 2,316 2,387 Construction in progress N/A 3,474 3,619 Property and equipment $ 185,810 $ 185,154 Accumulated depreciation (81,493 ) (77,479 ) Property and equipment, net $ 104,317 $ 107,675 Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under financing obligations, property under capital leases and intangible assets for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $10.7 billion , $10.5 billion and $10.1 billion , respectively. Leases The Company leases land, buildings, fixtures and equipment and transportation equipment. The Company estimates the expected lease term by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. The expected lease term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected lease term and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases. 54 The Company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, the payments, regardless of the significance, are automatic indicators of ownership and require the Company to capitalize the lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation. Upon completion of the lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company is deemed to have ""continuing involvement,"" the leased assets and the related financing obligation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term. At the end of the lease term, including exercise of any renewal options, the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a non-cash gain. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are initially recorded at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2019 , the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. After evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill. The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2019 and 2018 : (Amounts in millions) Walmart U.S. Walmart International Sam's Club Total Balances as of February 1, 2017 $ 2,236 $ 14,488 $ 313 $ 17,037 Changes in currency translation and other — 996 — 996 Acquisitions 209 — — 209 Balances as of January 31, 2018 2,445 15,484 313 18,242 Changes in currency translation and other — (743 ) — (743 ) Acquisitions (1) 107 13,575 — 13,682 Balances as of January 31, 2019 $ 2,552 $ 28,316 $ 313 $ 31,181 (1) Goodwill recorded in fiscal 2019 for Walmart International relates to Flipkart. Intangible assets are included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets are evaluated for impairment based on their fair values using valuation techniques which are updated annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions. There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . 55 Fair Value Measurement In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-01, Financial Instruments–Overall (Topic 825) , which updated certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments (""ASU 2016-01""). The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which primarily impacted the Company's accounting for its investment in JD.com, Inc. (""JD"") and resulted in a positive adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $2.6 billion , net of tax, based on the market value of the Company's investment in JD as of January 31, 2018. The adoption required prospective changes in fair value of the Company's investment in JD to be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income, which the Company classifies in other gains and losses. The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Self Insurance Reserves The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits . Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability. Derivatives The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivatives will change. In a hedging relationship, the change in the value of the derivative is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. Credit risk related to a derivative represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty when appropriate. The Company only enters into derivatives with counterparties rated ""A-"" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Subsequent to entering into derivatives, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties. The notional, or contractual, amount of the Company's derivatives is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company's exposure due to credit risk. The contractual terms of the Company's derivatives closely mirror those of the hedged items, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings. The Company's net investment and cash flow hedges are highly effective and the ineffective portion has not been, and is not expected to be, significant. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change. Fair Value Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss. The Company's interest rate swaps that receive fixed-interest rate payments and pay variable-interest rate payments are designated as fair value hedges. As the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivatives match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivatives are assumed to be perfectly effective hedges. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items, also recorded in earnings, and, accordingly, do not impact the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from October 2020 to April 2024 . 56 Net Investment Hedges The Company is a party to cross-currency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments. The agreements are contracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency for fixed-rate payments in another currency. All changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the related investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to February 2030 . The Company has issued foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of net investments of certain of its foreign operations. These foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt issuances are designated and qualify as nonderivative hedging instruments. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debt instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Cash Flow Hedges The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on the non-U.S. denominated debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The hedged items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and the assessment of effectiveness (and measurement of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash flows. As a result, the amount reclassified into earnings each period includes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that re-measurement and the adjustment to earnings for the period's allocable portion of the initial spot-forward difference associated with the hedging instrument. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2022 to March 2034 . Financial Statement Presentation Realized derivative gains and losses are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Although subject to master netting arrangements, the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 7 for the net presentation of the Company's derivatives. Additionally, the Company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset and records cash collateral it posts with counterparties as amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (""temporary differences""). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains a provision which subjects a US parent of a foreign subsidiary to current US tax on its global intangible low–taxed income (“GILTI”). The GILTI income is eligible for a deduction, which lowers the effective tax rate to 10.5% for calendar years 2018 through 2025 and 13.125% after 2025. The Company will report the tax impact of GILTI as a period cost when incurred. Accordingly, the Company is not providing deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI. In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. 57 The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement–Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (""ASU 2018-02""). This ASU provides that the stranded tax effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (""Tax Act"") in accumulated other comprehensive loss may be reclassified to retained earnings. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which resulted in an immaterial negative adjustment to retained earnings. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach and applied this ASU only to contracts not completed as of February 1, 2018. The accounting policies and other disclosures are below as well as the disclosure of disaggregated revenues in Note 15 . The impact of adopting this ASU was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Sales The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Additionally, estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns. Membership Fee Revenue The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $1.4 billion for each of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gift Cards Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period. Management periodically reviews and updates its estimates. Financial and Other Services The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Contract Balances Contract balances as a result of transactions with customers primarily consist of receivables included in receivables, net, and deferred gift card revenue included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table provides the Company's receivables and deferred gift card revenue from transactions with customers: (Amounts in millions) As of January 31, 2019 Assets: Receivables from transactions with customers, net $ 2,538 Liabilities: Deferred gift card revenue $ 1,932 58 Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs. Payments from Suppliers The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold. Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. In certain limited situations, reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific, incremental and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction of advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs were $3.5 billion , $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Currency Translation The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet. Certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures are also required. The Company will adopt this ASU and related amendments as of the beginning of the first quarter of the year ending January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020"") and will be electing certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to determine if they contain leases. The Company will be exempting leases with an initial term of twelve months or less from balance sheet recognition and, for most classes of assets, the Company will be combining non-lease components with lease components. Management has implemented and continues to implement new lease systems in connection with the adoption. The adoption of this ASU and related amendments will result in total assets and liabilities increasing approximately $15 billion , which is primarily due to recognizing approximately $17.5 billion of operating lease assets and liabilities, partially offset by derecognizing approximately $3 billion of assets and liabilities related to financial obligations connected with the construction of leased stores. Several other line items in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet will also be impacted by immaterial amounts. The Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows will not be materially impacted. Finally, management expects the first quarter fiscal 2020 disclosure of future operating commitments to significantly increase compared to the aggregate minimum rentals disclosed in Note 11 , primarily because the new standard requires reasonably assured renewals be included. 59 Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements. 60 Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 2017 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 7,179 $ 10,523 $ 14,293 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (509 ) (661 ) (650 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 6,670 $ 9,862 $ 13,643 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,929 2,995 3,101 Dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards 16 15 11 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,945 3,010 3,112 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 2.28 $ 3.29 $ 4.40 Diluted 2.26 3.28 4.38 Note 3. Shareholders' Equity The total authorized shares of $0.10 par value common stock is 11.0 billion , of which 2.9 billion and 3.0 billion were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Share-Based Compensation The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $773 million , $626 million and $596 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $181 million , $150 million and $212 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type for all plans: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Restricted stock and performance share units $ 293 $ 234 $ 237 Restricted stock units 456 368 332 Other 24 24 27 Share-based compensation expense $ 773 $ 626 $ 596 The Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the ""Plan""), as amended and restated effective February 23, 2016, as amended further as of February 1, 2017, and as renamed on February 1, 2018, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders. 61 The Plan's award types are summarized as follows: • Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0% to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and performance share units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance share units in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was 6.2% , 7.2% and 8.3% , respectively. • Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period; generally 50% vest three years from the grant date and the remaining 50% vest five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was 7.2% , 9.0% and 9.0% , respectively. In addition to the Plan, the Company's United Kingdom subsidiary has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years. The stock option share-based compensation expense is included in the Other line in the table above. Flipkart also maintains a stock option plan primarily for the benefit of employees and nonemployee directors under which options to acquire Flipkart common shares may be issued. The grants have no exercise price and no compensation expense was recognized during fiscal 2019 due to a liquidity event performance condition that was not deemed probable of occurrence. The following table shows the activity for restricted stock and performance share units and restricted stock units during fiscal 2019 : Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units (1) Restricted Stock Units (Shares in thousands) Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share Shares Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share Outstanding as of February 1, 2018 8,558 $ 70.47 24,153 $ 66.69 Granted 3,600 84.94 7,946 80.94 Vested/exercised (2,448 ) 74.67 (5,524 ) 69.52 Forfeited (911 ) 68.24 (2,620 ) 69.74 Outstanding as of January 31, 2019 8,799 $ 75.39 23,955 $ 70.47 (1) Assumes payout rate at 100% for Performance Share Units. The following table includes additional information related to restricted stock and performance share units and restricted stock units: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except years) 2019 2018 2017 Fair value of restricted stock and performance share units vested $ 183 $ 181 $ 149 Fair value of restricted stock units vested 386 344 261 Unrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock and performance share units 362 291 211 Unrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock units 1,002 972 986 Weighted average remaining period to expense for restricted stock and performance share units (years) 1.1 1.2 1.3 Weighted average remaining period to expense for restricted stock units (years) 1.6 1.8 1.9 Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal year 2019 were made under the current $20.0 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of January 31, 2019 , authorization for $11.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. 62 The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations and the market price of the Company's common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 2017 Total number of shares repurchased 79.5 104.9 119.9 Average price paid per share $ 93.18 $ 79.11 $ 69.18 Total cash paid for share repurchases $ 7,410 $ 8,296 $ 8,298 63 Note 4. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss The following table provides the changes in the composition of total accumulated other comprehensive loss for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : (Amounts in millions and net of income taxes) Currency Translation and Other Net Investment Hedges Unrealized Gain on Available-for-Sale Securities Cash Flow Hedges Minimum Pension Liability Total Balances as of February 1, 2016 $ (11,690 ) $ 1,022 $ — $ (336 ) $ (593 ) $ (11,597 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net (2,817 ) 413 145 (22 ) (389 ) (2,670 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net — — — 43 (8 ) 35 Balances as of January 31, 2017 (14,507 ) 1,435 145 (315 ) (990 ) (14,232 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net 2,345 (405 ) 1,501 436 83 3,960 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net 26 — — 1 64 91 Balances as of January 31, 2018 (12,136 ) 1,030 1,646 122 (843 ) (10,181 ) Adoption of new accounting standards on February 1, 2018 (1) 89 93 (1,646 ) 28 — (1,436 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net (2,093 ) 272 — (339 ) 93 (2,067 ) Reclassifications to income, net (2) 2,055 — — 49 38 2,142 Balances as of January 31, 2019 $ (12,085 ) $ 1,395 $ — $ (140 ) $ (712 ) $ (11,542 ) (1) Primarily relates to the adoption of ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2018-02. (2) Includes a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $2.0 billion , for which there was no related income taxes, upon sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil (see Note 13 ). The income tax impact for each of the amounts shown in the table above is immaterial. Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for derivatives are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income, and the amounts for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation resulting from the disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Note 5. Accrued Liabilities The Company's accrued liabilities consist of the following as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 : January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Accrued wages and benefits (1) $ 6,504 $ 6,998 Self-insurance (2) 3,979 3,737 Accrued non-income taxes (3) 2,979 3,073 Deferred gift card revenue 1,932 2,017 Other (4) 6,765 6,297 Total accrued liabilities $ 22,159 $ 22,122 (1) Accrued wages and benefits include accrued wages, salaries, vacation, bonuses and other incentive plans. (2) Self-insurance consists of insurance-related liabilities, such as workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits . (3) Accrued non-income taxes include accrued payroll, value added, sales and miscellaneous other taxes. (4) Other accrued liabilities consist of various items such as maintenance, utilities, advertising, interest and legal contingencies. 64 Note 6. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt Short-term borrowings consist of commercial paper and lines of credit. Short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 were $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion , respectively, with weighted-average interest rates of 2.7% and 1.5% , respectively. The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S., committed with 22 financial institutions, totaling $15.0 billion and $12.5 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. These committed lines of credit are summarized in the following table: January 31, 2019 January 31, 2018 (Amounts in millions) Available Drawn Undrawn Available Drawn Undrawn Five-year credit facility (1) $ 5,000 $ — $ 5,000 $ 5,000 $ — $ 5,000 364-day revolving credit facility (1) 10,000 — 10,000 7,500 — 7,500 Total $ 15,000 $ — $ 15,000 $ 12,500 $ — $ 12,500 (1) In May 2018, the Company renewed and extended its existing five-year credit facility and its existing 364-day revolving credit facility, both of which are used to support its commercial paper program. The committed lines of credit in the table above mature at various times between May 2019 and May 2023 , carry interest rates generally ranging between LIBOR plus 10 basis points and LIBOR plus 75 basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between 1.5 and 4.0 basis points. In conjunction with the committed lines of credit listed in the table above, the Company has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt. Additionally, the Company also maintains other committed lines of credit outside of the U.S., with available amounts of approximately $3.0 billion and $4.0 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, of which approximately $0.2 billion and no amount was drawn as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Apart from the committed lines of credit, the Company has syndicated and fronted letters of credit available totaling $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , of which $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion was drawn as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Company also has trade letters of credit, without stated limits, of which $0.4 billion was drawn as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 . The Company's long-term debt, which includes the fair value instruments further discussed in Note 8 , consists of the following as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 : January 31, 2019 January 31, 2018 (Amounts in millions) Maturity Dates By Fiscal Year Amount Average Rate (1) Amount Average Rate (1) Unsecured debt Fixed 2020 - 2049 $ 35,816 3.9% $ 24,540 3.9% Variable 2020 - 2022 1,800 2.9% 800 4.1% Total U.S. dollar denominated 37,616 25,340 Fixed 2023 - 2030 2,870 3.3% 3,101 3.3% Variable — — Total Euro denominated 2,870 3,101 Fixed 2031 - 2039 3,524 5.4% 3,801 5.4% Variable — — Total Sterling denominated 3,524 3,801 Fixed 2021 - 2028 1,651 0.4% 1,655 0.4% Variable — — Total Yen denominated 1,651 1,655 Total unsecured debt 45,661 33,897 Total other (2) (265 ) (114 ) Total debt 45,396 33,783 Less amounts due within one year (1,876 ) (3,738 ) Long-term debt $ 43,520 $ 30,045 (1) The average rate represents the weighted-average stated rate for each corresponding debt category, based on year-end balances and year-end interest rates. Interest costs are also impacted by certain derivatives described in Note 8 . (2) Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 the Company had secured debt in the amount of $8 million and $10 million , respectively, which was collateralized by property that had an aggregate carrying amount of $82 million and $101 million , respectively. As of January 31, 2018 , the Company had $500 million in debt with embedded put options. These bonds matured in June 2018, and were fully repaid. The issuance of money market puttable reset securities in the amount of $500 million is structured to be remarketed in connection with the annual reset of the interest rate. If, for any reason, the remarketing of the notes does not occur at the time of any interest rate reset, the holders of the notes must sell and the Company must repurchase the notes at par. 65 Accordingly as of January 31, 2018 , this issuance was classified as long-term debt due within one year in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Annual maturities of long-term debt during the next five years and thereafter are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Annual Fiscal Year Maturities 2020 $ 1,876 2021 5,347 2022 3,080 2023 2,844 2024 4,595 Thereafter 27,654 Total $ 45,396 Debt Issuances Information on long-term debt issued during fiscal 2019 to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Flipkart acquisition discussed in Note 13 and for general corporate purposes, is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Issue Date Principal Amount Maturity Date Fixed vs. Floating Interest Rate Net Proceeds June 27, 2018 750 USD June 23, 2020 Floating Floating $ 748 June 27, 2018 1,250 USD June 23, 2020 Fixed 2.850% 1,247 June 27, 2018 750 USD June 23, 2021 Floating Floating 748 June 27, 2018 1,750 USD June 23, 2021 Fixed 3.125% 1,745 June 27, 2018 2,750 USD June 26, 2023 Fixed 3.400% 2,740 June 27, 2018 1,500 USD June 26, 2025 Fixed 3.550% 1,490 June 27, 2018 2,750 USD June 26, 2028 Fixed 3.700% 2,725 June 27, 2018 1,500 USD June 28, 2038 Fixed 3.950% 1,473 June 27, 2018 3,000 USD June 29, 2048 Fixed 4.050% 2,935 Various 21 USD Various Various Various 21 Total $ 15,872 The June 2018 issuances are senior, unsecured notes which rank equally with all other senior, unsecured debt obligations of the Company, and are not convertible or exchangeable.

(2) Represents portion of the principal amount repaid during fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2018, in connection with extinguishing debt, the Company paid premiums of approximately $3.1 billion which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $3.1 billion . 67 Note 7. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company measures the fair value of equity investments (primarily its investment in JD) on a recurring basis and records them in other long-term assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Measurement details about the Company's two portions of the investment in JD are as follows: • The purchased portion of the investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs, which prior to fiscal 2019 was classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value recognized through other comprehensive income; and • The portion of the investment in JD received in exchange for selling certain assets related to Yihaodian, the Company's former eCommerce operation in China, measured using Level 2 inputs. Fair value is determined primarily using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets. Prior to fiscal 2019, the investment was carried at cost. Information for the cost basis, carrying value and fair value of the Company's investment in JD is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Cost Basis Carrying Value as of January 31, 2018 Fair Value as of February 1, 2018 Fair Value as of January 31, 2019 Investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs $ 1,901 $ 3,547 $ 3,547 (1) $ 1,791 Investment in JD measured using Level 2 inputs 1,490 1,490 3,559 (2) 1,792 Total $ 3,391 $ 5,037 $ 7,106 $ 3,583 (3) (1) Fair value was already recognized on the balance sheet. Upon adoption of the new financial instrument standard on February 1, 2018, the excess of fair value over cost was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings. (2) Upon adoption of the new financial instrument standard on February 1, 2018, the excess of fair value over cost was recognized by increasing the carrying value of the asset and retained earnings. (3) The decreases in fair value from February 1, 2018 to January 31, 2019 of $ 3.5 billion was recognized in net income and included in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also has derivatives. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: January 31, 2019 January 31, 2018 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 4,000 $ (78 ) $ 4,000 $ (91 ) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges 2,250 334 2,250 208 Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 4,173 (272 ) 4,523 205 Total $ 10,423 $ (16 ) $ 10,773 $ 322 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. As discussed in Note 13 , the Company sold the majority stake in Walmart Brazil during fiscal 2019. The assets of the disposal group totaled $3.3 billion and were comprised of $1.0 billion in current assets, $1.6 billion in property and equipment and property under capital lease and financing obligations, net, and $0.7 billion of other long-term assets. When measured as held for sale, these assets were fully impaired as the carrying value of the disposal group exceeded the fair value, less costs to sell and contributed to a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion in the Walmart International segment, which was recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. Other impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2019 were immaterial. 68 For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 , the Company recorded impairment charges related to assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis of approximately $1.4 billion primarily related to the following: • in the Sam's Club segment as discussed in Note 14 , $0.6 billion for restructuring charges for closures of underperforming clubs; the impaired assets consisted primarily of buildings and related store fixtures, and leased assets of its retail operations; • in the Walmart International segment as discussed in Note 14 , $0.2 billion for restructuring charges for the wind-down of the Brazil first-party eCommerce business; the impaired assets consisted primarily of fixtures and equipment; and • immaterial discontinued real estate projects in the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments and decisions to exit certain international properties in the Walmart International segment. These impairment charges were classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value was determined based on comparable market values of similar properties or on a rental income approach, using Level 2 inputs. Impairment charges not related to restructuring or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2018 were not material. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , are as follows: January 31, 2019 January 31, 2018 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 45,396 $ 49,570 $ 33,783 $ 38,766 Note 8. Derivatives In connection with various derivative agreements, including master netting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $220 million and $279 million as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , respectively. Furthermore, as part of the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's net derivative liability position exceeds $150 million with such counterparties. The Company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , respectively. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , the Company had ¥180 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of £1.7 billion as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 that was designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to January 2039 . The Company's derivatives, as well as its nonderivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, were classified as follows as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: January 31, 2019 January 31, 2018 (Amounts in millions) Fair Value Hedges Net Investment Hedges Cash Flow Hedges Fair Value Hedges Net Investment Hedges Cash Flow Hedges Derivatives Derivative assets: Other long-term assets $ — $ 334 $ 78 $ — $ 208 $ 300 Derivative liabilities: Deferred income taxes and other 78 — 350 91 — 95 Nonderivative hedging instruments Long-term debt — 3,863 — — 4,041 — Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant. Note 9. Taxes The components of income before income taxes are as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2017 U.S. 15,875 10,722 15,680 Non-U.S. (4,415 ) 4,401 4,817 Total income before income taxes 11,460 15,123 20,497 A summary of the provision for income taxes is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Current: U.S. federal $ 2,763 $ 2,998 $ 3,454 U.S. state and local 493 405 495 International 1,495 1,377 1,510 Total current tax provision 4,751 4,780 5,459 Deferred: U.S. federal (361 ) (22 ) 1,054 U.S. state and local (16 ) (12 ) 51 International (93 ) (146 ) (360 ) Total deferred tax expense (benefit) (470 ) (180 ) 745 Total provision for income taxes $ 4,281 $ 4,600 $ 6,204 In December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and significantly changed U.S. income tax law. Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate and created new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI""). In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""SAB 118""), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. While management believes the Company's accounting for Tax Reform is complete, it is based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was $207 million , and in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $442 million of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for income taxes . One-time Transition Tax The Tax Act required the Company to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $1.9 billion of additional income tax expense for its one-time transitional tax liability. The Company finalized the calculations of the Transition Tax liability and increased the provisional amount by $413 million , with the increase included as a component of provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019. Deferred Tax Effects The Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% , beginning January 2018. Accordingly, the Company re-measured its deferred taxes as of January 31, 2018, to reflect the reduced rate that will apply in future periods when these deferred taxes are settled or realized. In fiscal 2018, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of $2.1 billion to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate and other effects of the Tax Act. In fiscal 2018, the Company made no provisional adjustment with respect to the GILTI provision of the Tax Act. Upon finalizing the provisional accounting for the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded an additional tax benefit of $75 million , which is included as a component of provision for income taxes. 69 Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation In the past, the Company's effective income tax rate was typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower–taxed global operations, including the use of global funding structures and certain U.S. tax credits as further discussed in the ""Cash and Cash Equivalents"" section of Note 1 . However, beginning January 2018, the US statutory rate of 21.0% generally falls below statutory rates in international jurisdictions. A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2019 2018 2017 U.S. statutory tax rate 21.0 % 33.8 % 35.0 % U.S. state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 3.3 % 1.8 % 1.7 % Impact of the Tax Act: One-time transition tax 3.6 % 12.3 % — % Deferred tax effects (0.7 )% (14.1 )% — % Income taxed outside the U.S. (3.5 )% (6.3 )% (4.5 )% Disposition of Walmart Brazil 6.7 % — % — % Valuation allowance 6.4 % 2.1 % — % Net impact of repatriated international earnings 0.8 % (0.1 )% (1.0 )% Federal tax credits (1.2 )% (0.9 )% (0.6 )% Other, net 1.0 % 1.8 % (0.3 )% Effective income tax rate 37.4 % 30.4 % 30.3 % Deferred Taxes The significant components of the Company's deferred tax account balances are as follows: January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Deferred tax assets: Loss and tax credit carryforwards $ 2,964 $ 1,989 Accrued liabilities 2,135 2,482 Share-based compensation 245 217 Other 1,131 1,251 Total deferred tax assets 6,475 5,939 Valuation allowances (2,448 ) (1,843 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 4,027 4,096 Deferred tax liabilities: Property and equipment 4,175 3,954 Acquired intangibles 2,099 401 Inventory 1,354 1,153 Other 899 540 Total deferred tax liabilities 8,527 6,048 Net deferred tax liabilities $ 4,500 $ 1,952 The deferred taxes noted above are classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets: January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Balance Sheet classification Assets: Other long-term assets $ 1,796 $ 1,879 Liabilities: Deferred income taxes and other 6,296 3,831 Net deferred tax liabilities $ 4,500 $ 1,952 70 Unremitted Earnings Prior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings. During fiscal 2019, the Company repatriated to the U.S. $5.3 billion of cash relating to fiscal 2019 and prior earnings at a tax cost of approximately $40 million . As of January 31, 2019, the Company has not recorded approximately $ 3 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation. Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances As of January 31, 2019 , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling $12.2 billion . Of these carryforwards, $8.0 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2039 . The remaining carryforwards have no expiration. As of January 31, 2019 , the Company's transition tax calculation fully utilized all foreign tax credit carryforwards. The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent that a valuation allowance has been established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the valuation allowance will be released. The Company had valuation allowances of $2.4 billion and $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Net activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2019 related to the acquisition of Flipkart and disposal of Walmart Brazil, changes in judgment regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets, releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets and decreases due to operating loss expirations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be fully realized. Uncertain Tax Positions The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $1.1 billion and $690 million as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 1,010 $ 1,050 $ 607 Increases related to prior year tax positions 620 130 388 Decreases related to prior year tax positions (107 ) (254 ) (32 ) Increases related to current year tax positions 203 122 145 Settlements during the period (390 ) (23 ) (46 ) Lapse in statutes of limitations (31 ) (15 ) (12 ) Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 1,305 $ 1,010 $ 1,050 Interest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as expeditiously as possible. As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months. The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2014 through 2019 . The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2012 through 2019 , and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2013 through 2019 . 71 Other Taxes The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 10. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. ASDA Equal Value Claims ASDA Stores, Ltd. (""Asda""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in nearly 30,000 ""equal value"" claims that are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the ""Employment Tribunal"") in the United Kingdom (""UK"") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. As a result, claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. On March 23, 2015, Asda asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings and to ""strike out"" substantially all of the claims because the claimants had not adhered to the Tribunal's procedural rule for including multiple claimants on the same claim form. On July 23, 2015, the Employment Tribunal denied Asda's requests. Following additional proceedings, on June 20, 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled in favor of Asda on the ""strike out"" issue and remitted the matter to the Employment Tribunal to determine whether the improperly filed claims should be struck out. On July 12, 2017, claimants sought permission from the Court of Appeals to appeal this ruling, which was granted on October 3, 2017. A hearing before the Court of Appeals on the ""strike out"" issue was held on October 23, 2018. On January 17, 2019, the Court of Appeals declined to strike out any claims relying on the Employment Tribunal’s finding that claimants had not deliberately disregarded the Tribunal’s procedural rule. As to the initial phase of the Equal Value claims, on October 14, 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. On August 31, 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal affirmed the Employment Tribunal's ruling and also granted permission for Asda to appeal substantially all of its findings. Asda sought permission to appeal the remainder of the Employment Appeal Tribunal's findings to the Court of Appeals. A hearing before the Court of Appeals on the comparability findings was held on October 10, 2018 and the Court of Appeals upheld the Employment Tribunal’s findings. Claimants are now proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. 72 National Prescription Opiate Litigation and Related Matters In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. FCPA Investigation and Related Matters The Audit Committee (the ""Audit Committee"") of the Board of Directors of the Company has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. (""Walmex""), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. The Audit Committee and the Company have engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and other advisors who are assisting in the on-going investigation of these matters. The Company has also been conducting a voluntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance. The Company is engaged in strengthening its global anti-corruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures. In November 2011, the Company voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). Since the implementation of the global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit Committee and the Company have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. When such allegations have been reported or identified, the Audit Committee and the Company, together with their third party advisors, have conducted inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, opened investigations. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations were commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates or has operated, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. As previously disclosed, the Company is under investigation by the DOJ and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. The Company has been cooperating with the agencies and discussions have been ongoing regarding the resolution of these matters. These discussions have progressed to a point that, in fiscal 2018, the Company reasonably estimated a probable loss and recorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to these matters (the ""Accrual""). As the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico also investigated these matters. Walmex cooperated with the Mexican governmental agencies that conducted these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation were filed by several of the Company's shareholders against Walmart, certain current and former directors and former officers and certain of Walmex's former officers. These matters have been resolved or immaterial accruals have been made for proposed settlements. The Company could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. There could be one or more enforcement actions in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties and shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. The Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters, which could impact the perception among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen. 73 In addition, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations. These costs will be expensed as incurred. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company incurred the following third-party expenses in connection with the FCPA investigation and related matters: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Ongoing inquiries and investigations $ 17 $ 26 $ 80 Global compliance program and organizational enhancements 13 14 19 Total $ 30 $ 40 $ 99 The Company does not presently believe that these matters, including the Accrual (and the payment of the Accrual at some point-in-time in the future), will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, the Company can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. Note 11. Commitments Rentals (including amounts applicable to taxes, insurance, maintenance, other operating expenses and contingent rentals) under operating leases and other short-term rental arrangements were $3.0 billion , $2.9 billion and $2.6 billion in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Aggregate minimum annual rentals as of January 31, 2019 , under non-cancelable leases are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fiscal Year Operating Leases (1) Capital Lease and Financing Obligations 2020 $ 1,856 $ 917 2021 1,655 856 2022 1,420 794 2023 1,233 667 2024 1,063 593 Thereafter 6,891 6,069 Total minimum rentals $ 14,118 $ 9,896 Less estimated executory costs 23 Net minimum lease payments 9,873 Financing obligation noncash gains and other 2,278 Less imputed interest (4,739 ) Present value of minimum lease payments $ 7,412 (1) Represents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of January 31, 2019 . Certain of the Company's leases provide for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales. Such contingent rentals were not material for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Substantially all of the Company's store leases have renewal options, some of which may trigger an escalation in rentals. Note 12. Retirement-Related Benefits The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The matching contributions immediately vest at 100% for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pretax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits. Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established. 74 The following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Defined contribution plans: U.S. $ 1,165 $ 1,124 $ 1,064 International 126 126 173 Total contribution expense for defined contribution plans $ 1,291 $ 1,250 $ 1,237 Additionally, the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan have sponsored defined benefit pension plans. The plan in the United Kingdom was overfunded by $326 million and $97 million as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The plan in Japan was underfunded by $175 million and $184 million as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Overfunded amounts are recorded as assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets and deferred charges. Underfunded amounts are recorded as liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in deferred income taxes and other. Certain other international operations also have defined benefit arrangements that are not significant. Note 13. Acquisitions, Disposals and Related Items The following significant transactions impact, or are expected to impact, the operations of the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or been announced. Walmart Brazil In August 2018, the Company sold an 80 percent stake of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (""Advent""). Under the terms, Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters. Additionally, the Company may receive up to approximately $250 million in contingent consideration. The disposal group consisted of the following: • Assets of $3.3 billion , which were fully impaired as discussed in Note 7 upon meeting the held for sale criteria; • Liabilities of $1.3 billion , consisting of $0.7 billion in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, $0.1 billion of capital lease and financing obligations, and $0.5 billion of deferred taxes and other long-term liabilities; and • Cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $2.0 billion , which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss (see Note 4 ). As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion during during fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income . In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by $0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the indemnity, the Company will indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion , adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. The Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent ownership interest, determined to have no initial fair value, using the equity method of accounting. Flipkart In August 2018, the Company acquired 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace , for cash consideration of approximately $16 billion . The acquisition increases the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. The purchase price allocation, which is still preliminary primarily due to certain tax items, is as follows: • Assets of $24.1 billion , which comprise primarily of $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 billion in other current assets, $5.0 billion in intangible assets and $13.6 billion in goodwill. Of the intangible assets, $4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The remaining $0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily relate to acquired technology with a life of 3 years . The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale primarily related to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes; • Liabilities of $3.7 billion , which comprise primarily of $1.8 billion of current liabilities and $1.8 billion of deferred income taxes; and • Noncontrolling interest of $4.3 billion , for which the fair value was estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. 75 The Company began consolidating the financial statements of Flipkart in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, using a one-month lag . To finance the acquisition, the Company used a combination of cash provided by long-term debt as discussed in Note 6 and cash on hand. The Flipkart results of operations since acquisition and the pro forma financial information are immaterial. Asda In April 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement and announced the proposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited (""Asda Group""), the Company's wholly owned UK retail subsidiary. Under the terms of the combination, the Company would receive approximately 42 percent of the share capital of the combined company. In addition, the Company would receive approximately £3 billion in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, and retain obligations under the Asda Group defined benefit pension plan . Due to a complex regulatory review process, the outcome of which continues to be uncertain, the held for sale classification criteria for the disposal group was not met as of January 31, 2019 . If the transaction closes, the Company would deconsolidate the financial statements of Asda Group and account for the ongoing investment in the combined company using the equity method of accounting. Suburbia In April 2017, the Company sold Suburbia, the apparel retail division in Mexico, for $1.0 billion . As part of the sales agreement, the Company is also leasing certain real estate to the purchaser. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $0.7 billion , of which $0.4 billion was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in membership and other income, and the remainder was deferred and is being recognized over the lease terms of approximately 20 years . Yihaodian and JD In June 2016, the Company sold certain assets relating to Yihaodian, its eCommerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application, to JD in exchange for Class A ordinary shares of JD, valued at $1.5 billion , representing approximately five percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis. The sale resulted in the recognition of a $535 million noncash gain, which was included in membership and other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequently, during fiscal 2017, the Company purchased $1.9 billion of additional JD shares, representing an incremental ownership percentage of approximately five percent , for a total ownership of approximately ten percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares. The following significant transaction primarily impacts the Company's Walmart U.S. segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or been announced. Jet.com, Inc. In September 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of jet.com, a U.S.-based eCommerce company. The integration of jet.com into the Walmart U.S. segment is building upon the current eCommerce foundation, allowing for synergies from talent, logistical operations and access to a broader customer base. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $2.4 billion , net of cash acquired. The allocation of the purchase price includes $1.7 billion in goodwill and $0.6 billion in intangible assets. As part of the transaction, the Company is paying additional compensation of approximately $0.8 billion over a five year period. Note 14. Restructuring Charges In fiscal 2018, the Company announced several organizational changes to position the business for more efficient growth going forward. As a result, the Company recorded $1.2 billion in pre-tax restructuring charges in fiscal 2018 as follows: Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018 (Amounts in millions) Asset Impairment Severance Costs Total Walmart International 193 43 236 Sam's Club 596 69 665 Corporate and support — 300 300 Total $ 789 $ 412 $ 1,201 The asset impairment charges primarily relate to the real estate of the Sam's Club closures and the wind-down of the Brazil first-party eCommerce business, which were written down to their estimated fair value. Refer to Note 7 for information on the fair value measurement. The pre-tax restructuring charges of $1.2 billion are classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2018. As of January 31, 2018, substantially all of the severance costs were recorded in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and were subsequently paid during fiscal 2019. Note 15. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil prior to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil discussed in Note 13 . The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. In fiscal 2019, the Company revised certain of its corporate overhead allocations, including depreciation expense, to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability . Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in the following table: (Amounts in millions) Walmart U.S. Walmart International Sam's Club Corporate and support Consolidated Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019 Net sales $ 331,666 $ 120,824 $ 57,839 $ — $ 510,329 Operating income (loss) 17,386 4,883 1,520 (1,832 ) 21,957 Interest, net (2,129 ) Other gains and (losses) (8,368 ) Income before income taxes $ 11,460 Total assets $ 105,114 $ 97,066 $ 12,893 $ 4,222 $ 219,295 Depreciation and amortization 6,201 2,590 639 1,248 10,678 Capital expenditures 6,034 2,661 450 1,199 10,344 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018 Net sales $ 318,477 $ 118,068 $ 59,216 $ — $ 495,761 Operating income (loss) 16,995 5,229 915 (2,702 ) 20,437 Interest, net (2,178 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (3,136 ) Income before income taxes $ 15,123 Total assets $ 104,347 $ 81,549 $ 13,418 $ 5,208 $ 204,522 Depreciation and amortization 6,005 2,601 698 1,225 10,529 Capital expenditures 5,680 2,607 626 1,138 10,051 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 Net sales $ 307,833 $ 116,119 $ 57,365 $ — $ 481,317 Operating income (loss) 17,012 5,737 1,628 (1,613 ) 22,764 Interest, net (2,267 ) Income before income taxes $ 20,497 Total assets $ 104,262 $ 74,508 $ 14,125 $ 5,930 $ 198,825 Depreciation and amortization 5,598 2,629 712 1,141 10,080 Capital expenditures 6,090 2,697 639 1,193 10,619 76 Total revenues, consisting of net sales and membership and other income, and long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, net, aggregated by the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. operations for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , are as follows: Fiscal Years Ended January 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Revenues U.S. operations $ 392,265 $ 380,580 $ 367,784 Non-U.S. operations 122,140 119,763 118,089 Total revenues $ 514,405 $ 500,343 $ 485,873 Long-lived assets U.S. operations $ 81,144 $ 81,478 $ 82,746 Non-U.S. operations 30,251 33,340 31,432 Total long-lived assets $ 111,395 $ 114,818 $ 114,178 No individual country outside of the U.S. had total revenues or long-lived assets that were material to the consolidated totals. Additionally, the Company did not generate material total revenues from any single customer. Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or market. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order online and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES General Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of Walmart Inc.'s Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Those Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing those Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make certain estimates and judgments, which are based upon currently available information and management's view of current conditions and circumstances. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our process of reporting financial information and the audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Audit Committee stays informed of the financial condition of Walmart Inc. and regularly reviews management's financial policies and procedures, the independence of our independent auditors, our internal control over financial reporting and the objectivity of our financial reporting. Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the Audit Committee regularly, both with and without management present. Acting through our Audit Committee, we have retained Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of our financial records and related data in connection with their audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have filed with the SEC the required certifications related to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2019 . These certifications are attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, we have also provided to the New York Stock Exchange the required annual certification of our Chief Executive Officer regarding our compliance with the New York Stock Exchange's corporate governance listing standards. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. During fiscal 2019, we announced an agreement to outsource select accounting transaction-processing activities which is part of an ongoing initiative to enhance our shared service model. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. 79 Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 . In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (""COSO"") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2019 . The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report which appears herein. Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their first assessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date of acquisition. Based on those guidelines, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting excluded Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart""), which the Company acquired in fiscal 2019, except for the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets that were included in management's assessment. Flipkart represented approximately 2% of the Company’s total assets as of January 31, 2019, after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded, and approximately 1% of the Company’s net sales for the year ended January 31, 2019. The Company's acquisition of Flipkart is discussed in Note 13 to its Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2019. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Report on Ethical Standards Our Company was founded on the belief that open communication and the highest ethical standards are necessary to be successful. Our long-standing ""Open Door"" communication policy helps management be aware of and address issues in a timely and effective manner. Through the open door policy all associates are encouraged to inform management at the appropriate level when they are concerned about any matter pertaining to Walmart. Walmart has adopted a Statement of Ethics to guide our associates in the continued observance of high ethical standards such as honesty, integrity and compliance with the law in the conduct of Walmart's business. Familiarity and compliance with the Statement of Ethics is required of all associates. The Company also maintains a separate Code of Ethics for our senior financial officers. Walmart also has in place a Related-Party Transaction Policy. This policy applies to Walmart's senior officers and directors and requires material related-party transactions to be reviewed by the Audit Committee. The senior officers and directors are required to report material related-party transactions to Walmart. We maintain a global ethics and compliance office which oversees and administers several reporting mechanisms, including an ethics helpline. The ethics helpline provides a channel for associates to ask questions and make confidential complaints regarding potential violations of our statements of ethics, including violations related to financial or accounting matters. These contacts may be made anonymously. /s/ C. Douglas McMillon C. Douglas McMillon President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ M. Brett Biggs M.

BUSINESS GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS Abbott Laboratories is an Illinois corporation, incorporated in 1900. Abbott’s* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. Established Pharmaceutical Products These products include a broad line of branded generic pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide and marketed and sold outside the United States in emerging markets. These products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers or public warehouses, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with, or licensed from, other companies. The principal products included in the broad therapeutic area portfolios of the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment are: • gastroenterology products, including Creon™, for the treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency associated with several underlying conditions, including cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis; Duspatal™ and Dicetel™, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome or biliary spasm; Heptral™, Transmetil™, and Samyr™, for the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis (associated with liver disease) or depressive symptoms; and Duphalac™, for regulation of the physiological rhythm of the colon; • women’s health products, including Duphaston™, for the treatment of many different gynecological disorders; and Femoston™, a hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women; • cardiovascular and metabolic products, including Lipanthyl™ and TriCor™, for the treatment of dyslipidemia; Teveten™ and Teveten™ Plus, for the treatment of essential hypertension, and Physiotens™, for the treatment of hypertension; and Synthroid™, for the treatment of hypothyroidism; • pain and central nervous system products, including Serc™, for the treatment of Ménière’s disease and vestibular vertigo; Brufen™, for the treatment of pain, fever, and inflammation; and Sevedol™, for the treatment of severe migraines; and • respiratory drugs and vaccines, including the anti-infective clarithromycin (sold under the trademarks Biaxin™, Klacid™, and Klaricid™); and Influvac™, an influenza vaccine. The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment directs its primary marketing efforts toward building strong brands with key stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Government agencies are also important customers. Competition in the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is generally from other health care and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors may increase competitive pressures. ________________________________________________________ * As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the term “Abbott” refers to Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois corporation, or Abbott Laboratories and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. 1 Table of Contents Diagnostic Products These products include a broad line of diagnostic systems and tests manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, clinics, physicians’ offices, retailers, government agencies, alternate care testing sites, and plasma protein therapeutic companies from Abbott owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors. The principal products included in the Diagnostic Products segment are: • core laboratory and transfusion medicine systems in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, and transfusion serology testing, including the Alinity ® family of instruments along with the ARCHITECT ® and Cell-Dyn ® systems. These systems are used for screening and/or diagnosis for cancer, cardiac and metabolic disorders, drugs of abuse, thyroid function, fertility, neurologic and general chemistries, infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV, therapeutic drug monitoring, and a suite of SARS-CoV-2 serology assays; • molecular diagnostics polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrument systems, including Alinity ® m and m2000™ that automate the extraction, purification, and preparation of DNA and RNA from patient samples, and detect and measure infectious agents including HIV, hepatitis, HPV, sexually transmitted infections, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A & B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); and products for oncology with the Vysis ® FISH product line of genomic-based tests; • point of care systems, including the i-STAT ® and next-generation i-STAT ® Alinity ® and cartridges for testing blood gas, chemistry, electrolytes, coagulation and immunoassay; • rapid diagnostics lateral flow testing products in the area of infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, including the BinaxNOW ® and Panbio ® rapid testing platforms, influenza, HIV, hepatitis, and tropical diseases such as malaria and dengue fever; molecular point-of-care testing for HIV, including the m-PIMA ® HIV-1/2 Viral Load Test, and for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A & B, RSV and strep A, including the ID NOW ® rapid molecular system; cardiometabolic testing, including Afinion ® and Cholestech LDX ® platforms and tests; a toxicology business for drug and alcohol testing; and consumer self-testing; and • informatics and automation solutions for use in laboratories, including laboratory automation systems such as the GLP systems track™, the RALS ® point of care solution, and AlinIQ ® , a suite of informatics tools and professional services. The Diagnostic Products segment’s products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, instrument warranty provisions, product performance, laboratory efficiency, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. Nutritional Products These products include a broad line of pediatric and adult nutritional products manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to consumers and to institutions, wholesalers, retailers, health care facilities, government agencies, and third-party distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers or third-party distributors. The principal products included in the Nutritional Products segment are: • various forms of infant formula and follow-on formula, including Similac ® , Similac ® 360 Total Care ® , Similac Pro-Advance ® , Similac ® Advance ® , Similac ® 360 Total Care ® Sensitive, Similac Pro-Sensitive ® , Similac Sensitive ® , Go & Grow by Similac ® , Similac ® NeoSure ® , Similac ® Organic, Similac ® Special Care ® , Similac Total Comfort ® , Similac ® Soy Isomil ® , Similac ® Alimentum ® , EleCare ® , Gain™, and Grow™; • adult and other pediatric nutritional products, including Ensure ® , Ensure Plus ® , Ensure ® Enlive ® , Ensure ® (with NutriVigor ® ), Ensure ® Max Protein, Ensure ® High Protein, Glucerna ® , Glucerna Hunger Smart ® , ProSure™, PediaSure ® , PediaSure SideKicks ® , PediaSure ® Peptide, Juven ® , Abound™, Pedialyte ® and Zone Perfect ® ; and • nutritional products used in enteral feeding in health care institutions, including Jevity ® , Glucerna ® 1.2 Cal, Glucerna ® 1.5 Cal, Osmolite ® , Oxepa ® , Freego™ (Enteral Pump) and Freego™ sets, Nepro ® , and Vital ® . Primary marketing efforts for nutritional products are directed toward consumers or to securing the recommendation of Abbott’s brand of products by physicians or other health care professionals. In addition, nutritional products are also promoted directly to the public by consumer marketing efforts in markets where permitted. 2 Table of Contents Competition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers’ products may increase competitive pressure. Medical Devices These products include a broad line of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care products for people with diabetes, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally marketed and sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, physicians’ offices, and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. The principal products included in the Medical Devices segment are: • rhythm management products, including Assurity MRI ® and Endurity MRI ® pacemaker systems, and Aveir ® VR single-chamber VR leadless pacemaker system; Ellipse ® , Fortify Assura ® , and Gallant ® implantable cardioverter defibrillators and Gallant and Quadra Assura MP ® implantable cardioverter defibrillator with cardiac resynchronization therapy and MultiPoint™ Pacing technology; and Confirm Rx ® and Jot Dx ® implantable cardiac monitors; • electrophysiology products, including the TactiFlex™ and TactiCath ® families of ablation catheters, and FlexAbility ® irrigated ablation catheters; EnSite ® family of cardiac mapping systems; Agilis ® NxT and Swartz™ introducer catheters; the Advisor ® HD Grid mapping catheter; and ViewFlex™ family of intracardiac echocardiography catheters; • heart failure related products, including the HeartMate ® left ventricular assist device family, the CardioMEMS ® HF System pulmonary artery sensor, a heart failure monitoring system, and the CentriMag ® System, an acute mechanical circulatory support system; • vascular products, including the XIENCE ® family of drug-eluting coronary stent systems developed on the Multi-Link Vision ® platform; StarClose SE ® , Perclose ProGlide ® and Perclose ProStyle ® vessel closure devices, TREK ® coronary balloon dilatation products, Hi-Torque Balance Middleweight Universal II ® guidewires, Supera ® Peripheral Stent System, a peripheral vascular stent system; Acculink ® /Accunet ® and Xact ® /Emboshield NAV6 ® , carotid stent systems; the OPTIS ® integrated systems with Ultreon™ 1.0 Software, compatible with the Dragonfly OPTIS ® imaging catheter and PressureWire ® fractional flow reserve measurement systems; and the JETi ® peripheral thrombectomy systems for clot removal; • structural heart products, including MitraClip ® , a mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair system; TriClip ® , a tricuspid valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair system; Epic ® , a surgical family of aortic valve and mitral valve replacement devices; Portico ® and Navitor™ transcatheter aortic heart valves; Regent™ and Masters Series™ mechanical heart valves; Amplatzer ® PFO occluders; Amplatzer Amulet ® occluder devices; and the Tendyne ® transcatheter mitral valve replacement system; • continuous glucose and blood glucose monitoring systems under the FreeStyle ® brand such as the FreeStyle Libre ® system, including sensors, data management decision software, test strips, and accessories for people with diabetes; and • neuromodulation products, including spinal cord stimulators Proclaim ® Elite and Proclaim ® XR Recharge-free implantable pulse generators (IPG) and Prodigy MRI ® IPG, each with BurstDR ® stimulation, and Proclaim ® DRG IPG, a neurostimulation device designed for dorsal root ganglion therapy, for the treatment of chronic pain disorders; and the Infinity ® Deep Brain Stimulation System with directional lead technology for the treatment of movement disorders. 3 Table of Contents These products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, product performance, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ABBOTT’S BUSINESS IN GENERAL Sources and Availability of Raw Materials Abbott purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to Abbott’s operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and around the world. Due to disruptions to the global supply chain caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic conditions such as inflationary pressures and labor shortages, Abbott has experienced availability issues with some materials and electronic components. To date, Abbott has been able to manage these challenges without significant supply disruptions or shortages for raw materials and supplies. A more detailed discussion on the global supply chain disruptions and its resulting impact on Abbott’s business is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors and in the ""Financial Review” section in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses Abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products. Accordingly, where possible, patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for Abbott’s products in the United States and countries of interest to Abbott. Abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications. Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 through 4. These, and various patents which expire during the period 2023 to 2043, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Abbott’s business. Abbott believes that no single patent, license, or trademark is material in relation to Abbott’s business as a whole. Seasonal Aspects, Customers, and Renegotiation There are no significant seasonal aspects to Abbott’s business. Abbott has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on Abbott. No material portion of Abbott’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government. Environmental Matters Abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal, state, and various other countries’ environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. Abbott’s capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2022 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2023. Abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which are owned by Abbott, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, Abbott believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Human Capital The sustainability of Abbott’s business depends on attracting, engaging and developing talented people with diverse backgrounds who share Abbott’s mission to help people live their healthiest possible lives. Abbott provides its employees opportunities to grow and develop their careers, market competitive compensation and benefit programs, and the satisfaction of being part of a global company dedicated to improving health in more than 160 countries. As of December 31, 2022, Abbott employed approximately 115,000 people, 69% of whom were employed outside of the U.S. Women represented 47% of Abbott’s U.S. workforce, 46% of its global workforce, and 41% of its managers. 4 Table of Contents Talent Management Abbott has an integrated global talent management process that is designed to identify and assess talent across the organization and provide equal and consistent opportunities for employees to develop their skills. All levels of employees participate in Abbott’s annual performance management process to create development plans that support their particular career objectives, and Abbott provides a broad range of training, mentoring and other development opportunities to help its employees meet these objectives. The board of directors conducts an annual Talent Management Review, focusing on development of talent, diversity, and succession planning for critical positions. Similar reviews take place across Abbott to develop talent and diversity across the organization. Diversity and Inclusion Abbott is committed to developing a workplace that is inclusive for all. Abbott ties executive compensation to human capital management, including diversity outcomes, to sustain an inclusive culture and the fair and balanced treatment of Abbott’s employees. In 2022, Abbott released the second edition of its diversity, equity, and inclusion report, providing an update on Abbott’s plans, strategies, and actions to fulfill its commitment to develop an inclusive workplace. Abbott’s employee networks play an important role in building an inclusive culture across all Abbott operations. A corporate officer serves as a sponsor for each of these networks, helping to align their objectives with Abbott’s business strategies. Abbott has ten such networks, which are: Early Career Network (supporting early career employees), Asian Leadership and Cultural Network, Black Business Network, Flex Network (supporting employees with part-time and flexible schedules), LA VOICE Network (supporting Hispanic and Latino employees), disABILITY Network (supporting employees with disabilities), PRIDE (supporting LGBTQ employees), Veterans Network, Women Leaders of Abbott, and Women in STEM. All networks are open to all Abbott employees. Abbott offers professional development programs, which provide recent college graduates the opportunity to rotate through different areas of Abbott, often with the chance to work outside their home country. In 2022, 53% of the participants were women. Also, Abbott hosts hundreds of college students for paid internships. In 2022, 58% of the U.S. interns were women and 59% were minorities. Further, Abbott has offered a STEM internship program for high school students in the U.S. since 2012 and since 2021, students who complete the program receive a college credit recommendation from the American Council on Education. The program’s objective is to increase the number of students pursuing STEM-related careers and contribute to a more diverse talent pipeline for Abbott. In 2022, 69% of the STEM interns were women and 78% were minorities. Health and Safety The health, safety and wellness of its employees is an Abbott priority embedded at every level of its business. Abbott’s integrated Environmental, Health and Safety organization governs health, safety and wellness at Abbott’s facilities. Abbott also maintains global policies and standards for managing employee health and safety. Abbott takes a holistic approach to employee well-being. Abbott’s global wellness programs are designed to meet the unique needs of employees across businesses and geographies and offer a wide range of programs, including supporting the mental, financial and physical health of employees and their families. For example, for over 20 years, Abbott has annually offered Exercise Across Abbott, which is a four-week physical wellness program that encourages employees to team up with colleagues and track how many minutes they exercise each day. Over 21,000 Abbott employees across 74 countries took part in 2022. Compensation and Benefits Abbott is committed to building, retaining, and motivating a diverse talent pipeline that can meet the current and future needs of its businesses. To that end, Abbott provides market competitive compensation, healthcare benefits, continuing education benefits, pension and/or retirement savings plans, financial support for employees with student loan debt, and several programs to facilitate employees building an ownership stake in Abbott, including a global long-term incentive program for employees generally beginning at the manager level. Abbott also has procedures and processes focused on ensuring employees receive equitable compensation, regardless of race or gender or other personal characteristics. 5 Table of Contents Regulation The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott’s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar international regulatory agencies. Government regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott’s products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott’s clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many pandemic-related products (including diagnostic tests) were authorized by regulators for emergency use solely during the pandemic. In addition, many governments enacted policies to expedite or promote access to health care in order to slow or stop the spread of the virus. Examples include expansion of telehealth coverages and increased reimbursements for diagnostic testing. On January 30, 2023, the U.S. announced that it plans to end the public health emergency on May 11, 2023. Abbott is evaluating the potential impacts of the end of the public health emergency, and it will continue to monitor further regulatory actions from relevant U.S. government agencies and assess potential impacts on pandemic-related government policies and product authorizations. Abbott’s international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott’s investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products. Abbott’s laboratory facilities, home monitoring services, and durable medical equipment suppliers, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to third-party payors. In the United States, Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria. Abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott’s business. Among other effects, health care regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Devices Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions, including suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory’s certification, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties. Abbott’s business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. 6 Table of Contents Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in many countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. Abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products. Many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, or coverage limitations. Budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on Abbott’s products for the foreseeable future. In the United States, the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices, diagnostics, supplies, and other products, as well as the procedures in which these products may be used. The government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home, and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time. For example, Medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment (including diabetes products), enteral nutrition products, and supplies. Additionally, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act established a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests in 2018. Governmental cost containment efforts also affect Abbott’s nutritional products business. In the United States, for example, under regulations governing the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula. As a result, through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. In October 2018, the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required, beginning with reports filed in 2022. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. Policy changes or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to health care systems. In the United States, this could include potential modification, including expansion or repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act. The regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information (including patient health information, financial information and other sensitive personal information), is increasing. For example, the European Union, China, various other countries, and various U.S. states (e.g., California, Virginia, and Colorado) have enacted data protection laws that contain significant compliance obligations and financial penalties for noncompliance. In addition, regulators with general consumer protection authority, such as the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. states Attorneys General, are focused on how consumer data is used by entities in the health care industry. Further, there are regulations of data privacy and security that are specific to health care companies. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information, and the FDA has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices. In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering “data localization” laws, which limit companies’ ability to transfer protected data across country borders. Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties. Transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended, and Abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area. Abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture, quality assurance requirements, marketing authorization processes, post-market surveillance requirements, availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services, as well as data privacy and security. Abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing health care products or services to market, access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical, nutrition, diagnostic, and medical device industries, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. 7 Table of Contents INTERNET INFORMATION Copies of Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through Abbott’s investor relations website ( www.abbottinvestor.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after Abbott electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission). These reports and other information are also available, free of charge, at www.sec.gov. Abbott’s corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of Abbott’s audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy committee are all available on Abbott’s investor relations website ( www.abbottinvestor.com ). 8 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott’s securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott’s actual results. Abbott’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Business and Operational Risks Disruptions to Abbott’s global supply chain, which is large and complex, could negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations . Abbott’s operations and performance depend on its ability to manage its large and complex global supply chain. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to global supply chain disruptions, which have adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services. While Abbott has taken actions to offset some of these inflationary pressures in its supply chain, Abbott may not be able to completely offset all the increases in its operational costs. Further, Abbott has experienced, and may continue to experience, availability issues with some services, operations, and materials used in its products. To date, Abbott has been able to manage the various supply chain challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for services, raw materials and supplies. The future extent to which supply chain disruptions may have a material effect on Abbott’s operating results is uncertain. A more detailed discussion on the supply chain disruptions impact on Abbott’s business is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. From time to time, Abbott pursues acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott’s credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity. Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s results of operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products make them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product availability, functionality or safety, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties. Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties. 9 Table of Contents Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Similarly, there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers or other partners with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers like Abbott. Any significant breach, attack or other disruption involving Abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business. Abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested. Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott’s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer. The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers or manufacturers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer. The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or the global supply chain, failure to meet product specifications, cyber attacks, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, time and expense spent investigating the cause and remediating the problem, if any, a production stoppage at a manufacturing facility, and depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers or manufacturers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability. Abbott has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility. As of December 31, 2022, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $16.8 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Further, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition. 10 Table of Contents Additionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility. Legal and Regulatory Risks Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it is costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. Abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, diagnostic product, or nutritional product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs. In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, consent decrees, seizures of Abbott’s products, and criminal prosecution. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott’s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott’s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. For information on Abbott’s voluntary recall in February 2022 of certain powder infant formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan, the manufacturing stoppage at such facility, and the consent decree that Abbott entered into with the FDA on May 16, 2022, see the discussion in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations. Abbott’s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely impact the demand for and price of Abbott’s products. Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott’s products’ coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott’s products or the prices that Abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them. 11 Table of Contents Further, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services. These provisions may be modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law. For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” The expiration or loss of intellectual property protection and licenses may affect Abbott’s future revenues and operating income. Many of Abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott’s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott’s intellectual property rights, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “Legal Proceedings.” Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition. Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. When new safety concerns are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety concerns arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product have been and could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety concerns affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for, or injury to, patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured and could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. Economic and Industry Risks Abbott is subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had, and may continue to have, a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition and results of operations. As a global healthcare company, public health crises, such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact certain of Abbott's operations. Health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause, and during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, significant reductions in demand for certain products, increased difficulty in serving customers, disruptions to manufacturing and supply chains, and negative effects on certain of Abbott’s operations as well as the operations of its suppliers, distributors and other third-party partners. Furthermore, such widespread outbreaks may impact, and during the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted, the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, inflation rates (including in the U.S.), foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to global supply chain disruptions, which have adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services. 12 Table of Contents With regard to COVID-19 diagnostic testing, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for several COVID‑19 related products in 2020 and 2021, including Abbott diagnostic tests. EUAs are authorized pursuant to an EUA Declaration under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and remain in effect until the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services terminates the EUA Declaration or unless sooner terminated or revoked. Abbott is actively pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory approval process for various COVID-19 diagnostic tests which has uncertainty as discussed in “ Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. ” in “Legal and Regulatory Risks” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” On January 30, 2023, the U.S. announced that it plans to end the public health emergency on May 11, 2023. Abbott is evaluating the potential impacts of the end of the public health emergency, and it will continue to monitor further regulatory actions from relevant U.S. government agencies and assess potential impacts on pandemic-related government policies and product authorizations. Further, the demand for COVID-19 tests has been volatile over the last two years as the number of COVID-19 cases has fluctuated during the period. Abbott expects the COVID-19 pandemic to shift to an endemic state in 2023, which would likely result in significantly lower demand for COVID-19 tests. Due to the unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic, including how and when it will shift to an endemic state, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. A more detailed discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott’s business is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income. In the United States and other countries, Abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on certain product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “Regulation.” To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Competitors’ intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition. In the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of patent litigation, such as competitor claims that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition. New products and technological advances by Abbott’s competitors may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations. Abbott’s products face intense competition from competitive products. Competitors’ products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott’s products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products. Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect Abbott’s financial statements and its ability to realize projected sales and earnings. Although Abbott’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2022 made up approximately 58 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott’s assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks. Information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott’s financial results is contained in the “Financial Review — Results of Operations” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott’s 2022 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in this report. 13 Table of Contents Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott’s customers depend on payment by government health care systems. The international nature of Abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. Abbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2022 made up approximately 58 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott’s international operations include: • differing local product preferences and product requirements; • trade protection measures, including tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, other governmental restrictions such as trade sanctions, and changes to international trade agreements; • difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations; • differing labor regulations; • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; • political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues; • restrictions on local currency conversion and/or cash extraction; • price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action; • inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates; • diminished protection of intellectual property; and • potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect Abbott’s profitability and its financial condition, including: • changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product approval standards, product labeling standards, source and use laws, and environmental laws; • differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, goodwill, and contingent consideration; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount; • changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott’s equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts; • changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts; • changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; global climate change, extreme weather and natural disasters; widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups; 14 Table of Contents • changes in Abbott’s business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future; • changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, wholesaler, or other customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; and • legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions. Many of these factors may manifest individually or collectively, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which resulted in political instability, sanctions, economic and currency volatility, inflation and other operational and supply disruptions. To date, Abbott has been able to manage these disruptions without material impact to its results of operations. However, it is difficult to predict the future implications and consequences of the situation on local, regional or global economies and Abbott’s operations. There could be additional sanctions, economic volatility, cybersecurity threats, political instability, transportation and other supply disruptions, as well as collection default risk or limited availability of resources to conduct essential business processes that could have a material adverse impact to Abbott’s operations and financial condition. The resolution and long-term impact of this matter are uncertain and difficult to predict.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2022, Abbott owned or leased properties totaling approximately 43 million square feet, of which approximately 65% is owned by Abbott. Abbott’s principal corporate offices are located in Illinois and are owned by Abbott. Abbott operates 88 manufacturing facilities globally. Abbott’s facilities are deemed suitable and provide adequate productive capacity. The manufacturing facilities are used by Abbott’s reportable segments as follows: Reportable Segments Manufacturing Sites Medical Devices 28 Diagnostic Products 22 Established Pharmaceutical Products 24 Nutritional Products 14 Worldwide Total 88 Abbott’s research and development facilities in the United States are primarily located in California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Ohio. Abbott also has research and development facilities in various other countries, including Colombia, India, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. There are no material encumbrances on the properties. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Abbott is involved in various claims, legal proceedings, and investigations, including (as of January 31, 2023) those described below. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Abbott is a defendant in numerous lawsuits involving certain of its specialty infant formula products administered to preterm infants. The lawsuits allege that preterm infants developed necrotizing enterocolitis as a result of being administered a cow’s milk-based preterm infant formula product, which resulted in personal injuries or death. As of January 31, 2023, there were 399 lawsuits pending in federal and state courts in which Abbott is a party. The plaintiffs seek various damages, including punitive damages. In April 2022, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered all federal court cases consolidated for pretrial purposes in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In addition, in December 2021, a purported class of Canadian preterm infants filed suit in British Columbia and, in October 2022, a purported class of Israeli preterm infants filed suit in Tel Aviv, both of which make similar allegations as those made in the United States against Abbott. These plaintiffs seek various damages, including punitive damages. Many of the lawsuits name another infant formula manufacturer as a co-defendant. In June and July 2021, DexCom, Inc. (DexCom) initiated patent infringement litigation against Abbott over certain of Abbott's continuous glucose monitoring products, including those under the FreeStyle brand, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and in the Regional Court of Mannheim in Germany. In both jurisdictions, DexCom seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages. In all cases, Abbott asserts that it has a license to each of Dexcom' s asserted patents and that the patents are invalid and not infringed. In July 2021, Abbott sued DexCom for patent infringement over certain of DexCom's continuous glucose monitoring products in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, the Regional Courts of Mannheim and Dusseldorf in Germany, and the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom. Abbott seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages. In December 2021, Abbott filed a breach of contract suit against DexCom in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that DexCom breached the parties' 2014 Settlement and License Agreement by asserting infringement of patents against Abbott that DexCom previously licensed to Abbott. In the U.S., DexCom’s patent infringement case is stayed pending resolution of Abbott’s breach of license case, which is currently set for trial on July 10, 2023. Abbott’s U.S. patent infringement trial against DexCom is currently scheduled for October 23, 2023. In November 2022, Abbott learned that the United States Department of Justice, through the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan, is conducting a criminal investigation related to Abbott’s manufacturing of infant formula. In December 2022, Abbott received a subpoena from the Enforcement Division of the Commission requesting information relating to Abbott’s powder infant formula business and related public disclosures. In January 2023, Abbott received a civil investigative demand from the United States Federal Trade Commission seeking information in connection with its investigation of companies who participate in bids for Women, Infants, and Children infant formula contracts. In addition, multiple civil lawsuits have been filed against Abbott regarding Abbott’s manufacturing of certain powder infant formula products. ITEM 4.

[RESERVED] 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and the measurement of net sales and costs is impacted by foreign currency translation. Sales in international markets comprise 58 percent of consolidated net sales. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected Abbott’s diversified health care businesses in various ways over the 2020 through 2022 period. Abbott’s Diagnostics segment experienced the most significant change in sales from 2020 to 2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. (The Diagnostics segment includes the Rapid Diagnostics, Core Laboratory Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics divisions.) In 2020 and 2021, Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch various new diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19. Rapid diagnostic tests developed by Abbott to detect COVID-19 included, among others, the following: • a molecular test on Abbott’s ID NOW ® rapid point-of-care platform launched in March 2020, • the professional BinaxNOW ® COVID-19 Ag Card test, a portable, lateral flow rapid test launched in August 2020, and • an over-the-counter, non-prescription BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Self Test for individuals with or without symptoms launched in March 2021. Each of these tests was launched in the U.S. pursuant to an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Outside the U.S., in September 2020, Rapid Diagnostics launched its Panbio ® rapid antigen test to detect COVID-19 pursuant to a CE Mark. In June 2021, Abbott announced that it had received CE Mark for its over-the-counter Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test for individuals with or without symptoms. In 2020, Molecular Diagnostics developed and launched molecular tests to detect COVID-19 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods on its m2000 ® RealTi m e lab-based platform and its Alinity ® m system pursuant to EUAs in the U.S. and CE Marks. Molecular Diagnostics also developed and launched its multiplex molecular test on its Alinity m system to detect COVID-19, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in one test. This multiplex molecular test was launched pursuant to a CE Mark in December 2020 and an EUA in the U.S. in March 2021. In 2020 and 2021, Core Laboratory Diagnostics developed and launched various lab-based serology blood tests on its ARCHITECT ® i1000SR ® and ARCHITECT i2000SR ® laboratory instruments and on its Alinity i system for the detection of an antibody to determine if someone was previously infected with the COVID-19 virus. The tests were launched under EUAs in the U.S. and CE Marks. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $8.4 billion in 2022, $7.7 billion in 2021, and $3.9 billion in 2020, led by sales related to Abbott’s BinaxNOW, Panbio and ID NOW rapid testing platforms. The demand for COVID-19 tests has been volatile over the last two years as the number of COVID-19 cases, especially in the U.S., has fluctuated during this period. On January 30, 2023, the U.S. government announced that it plans to end the COVID-19 public health emergency on May 11, 2023. Abbott is evaluating the potential impacts of the end of the public health emergency, and it will continue to monitor further regulatory actions from relevant U.S. government agencies and assess potential impacts on pandemic-related government policies and product authorizations. Abbott expects the COVID-19 pandemic to shift to an endemic state in 2023, which would likely result in significantly lower demand for COVID-19 tests. Due to the unpredictability of the pandemic, including how and when it will shift to an endemic state, the extent to which COVID-19 will have a material effect on Abbott's business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. With respect to other products sold by the Diagnostics segment, demand for routine diagnostic testing generally fluctuated with changes in the number of COVID-19 cases in various geographic regions throughout the 2020 - 2022 period. Across Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses, procedure volumes were negatively impacted i n 2021 and 2022 by surges of COVID-19 in various geographies as well as intermittent COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and healthcare staffing challenges. Despite such challenges, overall volume trends improved in several cardiovascular businesses in 2021 and 2022. While Abbott’s branded generic pharmaceuticals business was also negatively affected by the pandemic in 2020 as COVID-19 spread across emerging market countries, volumes recovered and grew in 2021 and 2022. Abbott’s nutritional and diabetes care businesses were the least affected by the pandemic. 21 Table of Contents Abbott is continually monitoring the effects of the pandemic on its operations. Throughout the pandemic, Abbott has continued to ensure that its operations throughout the world are aligned with the specific governmental orders and guidelines affecting each location. Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure to COVID-19 and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees. While Abbott’s 2022 and 2021 sales were most significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in total sales since 2020 also reflects the introduction of new products across various businesses as well as higher sales of various existing products. Sales in emerging markets, which represent approximately 35 percent of total company sales, increased 5.6 percent in 2022 and 19.6 percent in 2021, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. (Emerging markets include all countries except the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.) In U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals, Abbott initiated a voluntary recall in February 2022 of certain infant powder formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan and stopped production at the facility. On May 16, 2022, Abbott entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the steps necessary to resume production and maintain the Sturgis facility and operations. On July 1, Abbott restarted partial production at the facility beginning with its specialty formula EleCare ® and metabolic formulas. Subsequently, Abbott restarted Similac ® production. The consent decree does not affect any other Abbott plants or operations. In 2022, Abbott took various actions to mitigate the impact of the recall on the supply of formula in the U.S. These actions included the shipment of infant formula powder into the U.S. from Abbott's FDA-registered facility in Ireland; prioritization of infant formula production at its Columbus, Ohio facility; conversion of other liquid manufacturing lines into manufacturing Similac liquid ready-to-feed product; increased production of powder infant formula at its Casa Grande, Arizona manufacturing site; and importation of product from its facility in Spain as permitted by the FDA. Over the last three years, Abbott’s operating margin as a percentage of sales increased from 15.5 percent in 2020 to 19.6 percent in 2021 and then decreased to 19.2 percent in 2022. The decrease in 2022 from 2021 reflects the impact of the voluntary infant product recall and manufacturing stoppage in U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals and the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges on various manufacturing inputs and transportation costs across Abbott's businesses, partially offset by the favorable impact of margin improvement initiatives. The increase in 2021 from 2020 reflects the impact of sales volume increases for COVID-19 tests in Rapid Diagnostics and growth across virtually all of Abbott’s businesses due, in part, to partial recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges on various manufacturing inputs and transportation costs and an increase in restructuring costs. In 2022 and 2021, Abbott experienced availability issues with some services and materials used in its products. To date, Abbott has been able to manage the various supply chain challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for services, raw materials and supplies. The future extent to which inflation, supply chain disruptions, and unfavorable foreign exchange rates may have a material effect on Abbott's operating results is uncertain. While Abbott expects inflationary pressures on various raw materials, packaging materials and transportation costs to continue in 2023, the impact of such cost increases is expected to be at least partially mitigated by price increases in certain businesses and the impact of continued gross margin improvement initiatives. To the extent that supply chain challenges in the industries in which Abbott operates normalize over time, this may lessen inflationary pressures. With respect to the performance of each reportable segment over the last three years, sales in the Medical Devices segment, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 8.1 percent in 2022 and 19.4 percent in 2021. The sales increase in 2022 was driven by growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, and Heart Failure. The sales increase in 2021 was driven by double-digit growth across all of Abbott’s Medical Devices divisions, led by Diabetes Care, Structural Heart and Electrophysiology, due, in part, to a partial recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, operating earnings for the Medical Devices segment decreased 2.3 percent. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Medical Devices operating earnings increased 9.3 percent. The operating margin profile for the Medical Devices segment increased from 25.8 percent of sales in 2020 to 31.4 percent in 2021 and then decreased to 30.0 percent in 2022. The overall increase over the two years reflects the impact of higher sales volumes across the Medical Device businesses, partially offset by continued pricing pressures on drug eluting stents (DES) and other products. The decrease in 2022 from 2021 reflects various factors, including the impacts of inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges related to various manufacturing inputs and processes. In 2022, key product approvals in the Medical Devices segment included: • FDA clearance for the EnSite ® X EP System with EnSite OT, which leverages the Advisor ® HD Grid Catheter to provide a 360‑degree view of the heart without regard to the orientation of the catheter in the heart, • FDA clearance of the Freestyle Libre ® 3 system which automatically delivers up-to-the minute glucose readings and 14-day accuracy in a wearable sensor, 22 Table of Contents • FDA approval for an expanded indication for the CardioMEMS ® HF system, a small implantable pulmonary artery sensor and remote monitoring system that can detect early warning signs of worsening heart failure, • FDA approval for the Aveir ® single-chamber leadless pacemaker for the treatment of patients with slow heart rhythms, and • FDA approval of the Eterna TM rechargeable spinal cord stimulation system for the treatment of chronic pain. In Abbott’s Diagnostics segment, sales increased 10.4 percent in 2022 and 42.7 percent in 2021, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As was discussed above, sales growth in 2022 and 2021 was driven by demand for Abbott's portfolio of rapid diagnostics tests for COVID-19 and higher routine diagnostics testing in the core laboratory business, partially offset by lower demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based tests for COVID-19 in the molecular diagnostics business. In 2022, operating earnings for the Diagnostics segment increased 6.6 percent. The operating margin profile increased from 34.3 percent of sales in 2020 to 40.2 percent in 2022 primarily due to higher sales in Rapid Diagnostics and the impact of increased routine diagnostics testing on Core Laboratory Diagnostics versus 2020 levels. Abbott has regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, China, and other markets for the “Alinity c” and “Alinity i” instruments and has continued to build out its test menu for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics. Abbott has obtained regulatory approval for the “Alinity h” system for hematology in Europe, Japan and other regions. Abbott has also obtained regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe and other markets for the “Alinity s” (blood screening) and “Alinity m” (molecular) instruments and several testing assays. In Abbott’s Nutritional Products segment, total pediatric nutrition sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, decreased 16.6 percent in 2022 as a result of the voluntary recall and manufacturing stoppage discussed above as well as challenging market dynamics in Greater China. In December 2022, Abbott initiated steps to exit its pediatric nutrition business in China. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total pediatric nutrition sales increased 3.3 percent in 2021 driven by the Pedialyte ® , PediaSure ® and Similac brands in the U.S. as well as infant and toddler product growth across several international markets, partially offset by challenging market dynamics in the Greater China infant category. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total adult nutrition sales increased 4.8 percent in 2022 and 12.8 percent in 2021, led by the continued growth of Ensure ® , Abbott’s market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna ® , Abbott’s market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand, across several countries. In 2022, operating earnings for the Nutritional Products segment decreased 60.0 percent. Operating margins for the worldwide nutritional products business decreased from 22.9 percent in 2020 to 9.5 percent in 2022. The decrease was driven by the impact of the voluntary infant product recall and manufacturing stoppage as well as higher manufacturing and distribution costs, including commodity prices, partially offset by the impact of gross margin improvement initiatives and select product price increases. The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Established Pharmaceutical sales increased 10.6 percent in 2022 and 10.4 percent in 2021. The sales increases in 2022 and 2021 reflect higher sales in several geographies including India, China, and Brazil. In 2022, operating earnings for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment increased 18.0 percent. Operating margins increased from 18.5 percent of sales in 2020 to 21.4 percent in 2022 primarily due to the impact of gross margin improvement initiatives and higher selling prices partially offset by inflation on various product inputs. With respect to Abbott’s financial position, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, Abbott’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments total approximately $10.2 billion. Abbott’s long-term debt totals $16.8 billion and $18.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Abbott declared dividends of $1.92 per share in 2022 and $1.82 per share in 2021, an increase of approximately 5.5 percent. Dividends paid totaled $3.309 billion in 2022 compared to $3.202 billion in 2021. The year-over-year change in the amount of dividends paid reflects the increase in the dividend rate. In December 2022, Abbott increased the company’s quarterly dividend by 8.5 percent to $0.51 per share from $0.47 per share, effective with the dividend paid in February 2023. In December 2021, Abbott increased the company’s quarterly dividend by 4.4 percent to $0.47 per share from $0.45 per share, effective with the dividend paid in February 2022. On February 8, 2023, Abbott entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI). CSI sells an atherectomy system used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease. The acquisition, which is expected to add complementary technologies to Abbott’s portfolio of vascular device offerings, is subject to the approval of CSI shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. Under the terms of the agreement, Abbott will pay $20 per common share at a total expected equity value of approximately $890 million. The acquisition is expected to be funded with cash on hand. 23 Table of Contents In 2023, Abbott will also focus on continuing to invest in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth over the next several years. In its diagnostics business, Abbott's focus will include driving sales growth from its Alinity suite of diagnostics instruments and its portfolio of rapid diagnostic testing systems as well as continuing to meet COVID-19 test demand. In the Medical Devices segment, Abbott will focus on launching various new products and expanding its market position across the various businesses. In its nutritional business, Abbott will continue to focus on executing the actions needed to achieve a recovery in its infant formula business and growth globally. In the established pharmaceuticals business, Abbott will continue to focus on growing its business with the depth and breadth of its portfolio in emerging markets. Critical Accounting Policies Sales Rebates — In 2022, approximately 45 percent of Abbott’s consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances in 2022 are in the Nutritional Products and Diabetes Care businesses. Abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate gener ally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020 amounted to approximately $3.9 billion, $3.9 billion, and $3.3 billion, respectively, or 17.6 percent, 17.5 percent, and 20.1 percent of gross sales, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $22.4 billion, $22.3 billion, and $16.6 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one-percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $224 million in 2022. Abbott considers a one-percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $280 million, $268 million, and $207 million for cash discounts in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and $379 million, $211 million, and $232 million for returns in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated be cause Abbott’s historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals. In the WIC business, estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott holds the WIC contract. The state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price, is reliably determinable. Rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years. Except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the states submitting rebate claims. The USDA, which administers the WIC program, has been making its data available for many years. Management also estimates the states' processing lag time based on sales and claims data. Management has access to several large customers' inventory management data, which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel. At December 31, 2022, Abbott had WIC business in 37 states. Historically, adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. 24 Table of Contents Income Taxes — Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items is often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. In accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 were settled as of December 31, 2022. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. Pension and Post-Employment Benefits — Abbott offers pension benefits and post-employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for years, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. The significant net actuarial gains for these plans in 2022 reflects the impact of higher discount rates on the measurement of plan liabilities, partially offset by lower asset returns during the year. At December 31, 2022, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were net losses of $2.0 billion for Abbott’s defined benefit plans and net gains of $6 million for Abbott’s medical and dental plans. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post-employment benefits. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five-year period. Valuation of Intangible Assets — Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott’s critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs. At December 31, 2022, goodwill amounted to $22.8 billion and net intangibles amounted to $10.5 billion . Amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $2.0 billion in 2022 and 2021 and $2.1 billion in 2020 . There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2022 , 2021 , and 2020 . Litigation — Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $40 million to $50 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Accruals of approximately $45 million have been recorded at December 31, 2022 for these proceedings and exposures. These accruals represent management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last two years: Components of % Change Total % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2022 vs. 2021 1.3 (0.3) 6.7 (5.1) 2021 vs. 2020 24.5 (1.5) 24.4 1.6 Total U.S. 2022 vs. 2021 9.0 (0.6) 9.6 — 2021 vs. 2020 27.8 (1.9) 29.7 — Total International 2022 vs. 2021 (3.5) — 4.7 (8.2) 2021 vs. 2020 22.5 (1.3) 21.2 2.6 Established Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2022 vs. 2021 4.1 3.7 6.9 (6.5) 2021 vs. 2020 9.6 4.2 6.2 (0.8) Nutritional Products Segment 2022 vs. 2021 (10.1) 7.4 (13.6) (3.9) 2021 vs. 2020 8.5 1.0 6.7 0.8 Diagnostic Products Segment 2022 vs. 2021 6.0 (5.5) 15.9 (4.4) 2021 vs. 2020 44.8 (6.2) 48.9 2.1 Medical Devices Segment 2022 vs. 2021 2.2 (0.2) 8.3 (5.9) 2021 vs. 2020 21.9 (0.9) 20.3 2.5 The increase in Total Net Sales in 2022 reflects growth in demand for Abbott’s rapid diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19 as well as growth in the Established Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices segments, partially offset by lower Nutritional Products sales. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $8.4 billion in 2022, $7.7 billion in 2021 and $3.9 billion in 2020. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales decreased 0.3 percent in 2022. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 5.1 percent. Abbott’s net sales in 2022 were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 8.2 percent and total sales by 5.1 percent. The increase in Total Net Sales in 2021 reflects volume growth across all of Abbott's segments. In 2021, excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 15.2 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 13.7 percent. The price declines related to the Diagnostic Products segment in 2022 and 2021 primarily reflect lower pricing for COVID-19 tests. 26 Table of Contents The table below provides detail by sales category for the years ended December 31.

Total Established Pharmaceutical Products sales increased 10.6 percent in 2022 and 10.4 percent in 2021, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total sales in Key Emerging markets increased 11.8 percent in 2022 and 11.9 percent in 2021 due to higher sales in various geographies including India, China, and Brazil, and several therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, central nervous system/pain management, and cardiometabolic products. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales in Established Pharmaceuticals’ other emerging markets increased 7.3 percent in 2022 and 6.0 percent in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total Nutritional Products sales decreased 6.2 percent in 2022 compared to a 7.7 percent increase in 2021. The 28.7 percent decrease in U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales in 2022 reflects the impact of the voluntary recall and production stoppage of certain infant powder formula products manufactured at Abbott's facility in Sturgis, Michigan, partially offset by increased demand for Abbott’s Pedialyte products. U.S. sales of infant powder formula brands associated with the recall were $479 million and $1.2 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2021, U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales increased 10.3 percent compared to 2020, reflecting growth in Pedialyte, Similac, and PediaSure. International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 3.9 percent in 2022 and 3.2 percent in 2021. The 2022 decrease reflects the impact of challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China, partially offset by higher sales volumes in several countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America. The 2021 decrease reflects lower sales in China, the Middle East and various countries in Southeast Asia, partially offset by higher volumes sold in various countries in Latin America and Europe. 28 Table of Contents International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased 7.6 percent in 2022 and 17.0 percent in 2021, reflecting continued growth of the Ensure and Glucerna brands in various countries. In 2022, U.S. Adult Nutritional sales decreased 0.5 percent as continued growth of the Ensure brand was offset by lower sales of other products and the impact of temporarily utilizing liquid manufacturing capacity to manufacture infant formula. In 2021, U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 5.6 percent, primarily due to growth of Ensure and Glucerna. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, Diagnostics segment sales increased 10.4 percent in 2022 and 42.7 percent in 2021, driven by demand for Abbott’s portfolio of COVID-19 tests in Rapid Diagnostics. Rapid Diagnostics sales increased 22.5 percent and 93.3 percent in 2022 and 2021, respectively, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. The increases reflect COVID-19 test demand across Abbott’s rapid testing platforms, including the Panbio system, the ID NOW platfo rm, and the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test. Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $7.9 billion in 2022, $6.6 billion in 2021 and $2.6 billion in 2020. In 2022, Rapid Diagnostics sales increased 15.8 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and 19.1 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. These increases reflect higher sales of ID NOW tests for flu, strep, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as well as growth in various other Rapid Diagnostics products. In 2021, Rapid Diagnostics sales increased 10.4 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and 9.2 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. These increases reflected the recovery of routine diagnostic testing from the 2020 impact of the pandemic. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, sales increased 1.9 percent in 2022, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the higher volume of routine diagnostic testing from the continued roll-out of the Alinity platform and an expanded menu of tests. These higher volumes were partially offset by lower sales of Abbott’s laboratory-based tests for the detection of COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibodies as well as intermittent market disruptions in China due to COVID-19 quarantine restrictions in various cities. Core Laboratory Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were $62 million in 2022, $204 million in 2021, and $262 million in 2020. In 2022, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales decreased 2.0 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 4.8 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. In 2021, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 12.4 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, as a higher volume of routine diagnostic testing performed in hospitals and other laboratories was partially offset by lower sales of tests for the detection of COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibodies. In Molecular Diagnostics, sales decreased 27.4 percent in 2022 and 2.9 percent in 2021, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In both years, the decreases were driven by lower demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based PCR molecular tests for COVID-19, partially offset by growth in other areas from the continued roll-out of the Alinity m platform . Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $411 million in 2022, $891 million in 2021, and $1.0 billion in 2020. In 2022, Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 9.0 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and 13.8 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. In 2021, Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 29.2 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 27.0 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 8.1 percent in 2022 and 19.4 percent in 2021. In 2022 and 2021, the increase was driven by growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure. The 2022 and 2021 growth in Diabetes Care sales was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre, Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, in the U.S. and internationally. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $4.3 billion in 2022, which reflected a 22.4 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over 2021. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $3.7 billion in 2021, which reflected a 36.8 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over 2020 when sales totaled $2.6 billion. In 2022, while procedure volumes across Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were negatively impacted by new surges of COVID-19 in various geographies as well as intermittent COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in China and healthcare staffing challenges throughout the year, overall volumes improved in several businesses versus 2021. I n Electrophysiology, the 7.3 percent growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects the increase in procedure volumes and the continued roll‑out of Abbott’s EnSite X EP System with EnSite Omnipolar Technology (OT), a new cardiac mapping platform available in the U.S., Japan and across Europe. 29 Table of Contents Growth in Structural Heart, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was 13.0 percent in 2022, driven by growth across several areas of the busin ess, including Amplatzer® Amulet® Left Atrial Appendage Occluder, which offers immediate closure of the left atrial appendage, an area in the heart where blood clots can form and MitraClip®, Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, a leaky heart valve. In Vascular, 2022 sales decreased 1.0 percent, excluding the impact of exchange, as higher endovascular sales were offset by the negative effect of lower average selling prices globally on traditional DES and other coronary products and a lower recovery of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures which impacted the coronary business. In 2021, while procedure volumes across Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were negatively impacted early in the year by elevated COVID-19 case rates in certain countries, including the U.S., overall volumes improved over the course of 2021 across various businesses. The year-over-year increases in the various businesses reflect a recovery from the 2020 levels when the pandemic reduced procedure volumes as well as sales growth from pre-pandemic levels in Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, and Heart Failure, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. The growth in Structural Heart during 2021 was broad-based across several areas of the business, including MitraClip and TriClip ® , the world’s first minimally invasive, clip-based device for repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve. Abbott’s operations in Russia and Ukraine represent approximately 2 percent of Abbott’s total revenues and net assets, and to date the financial impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has not been material to Abbott’s operations or financial condition. Future implications are difficult to predict, but at present Abbott does not anticipate that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will have a material impact on its operations or financial condition. A more detailed discussion of the risks associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non-strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbott’s revenue recognition policies as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were not significant in 2022, 2021, or 2020. The expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. There are no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to materially affect Abbott. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 51.5 percent of net sa les in 2022, 52.2 percent of net sales in 2021, and 50.5 percent in 2020. The decrease in 2022 reflects the impact of the voluntary infant product recall and Sturgis manufacturing stoppage as well as the prioritization of infant formula sales related to the WIC Program in the Nutritional business. The decrease also reflects higher manufacturing and supply chain costs across Abbott's businesses, including inflation, commodities and distribution expenses. In 2021, the increase primarily reflects the effects of higher sales volume, higher manufacturing utilization, and the nonrecurrence of a 2020 impairment of intangible assets, partially offset by increases in various manufacturing costs and the impact of higher restructuring charges. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $2.9 billion in 2022, $2.7 billion in 2021, and $2.4 billion in 2020. The increase primarily reflects higher spending on various projects to advance products in development as well as the impairment of certain in-process R&D intangible assets partially offset b y the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Th e increase in 2021 R&D spending was primarily driven by higher spending on various projects to advance products in development. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were virtually unchanged in 2022 compared to 2021 as higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth was offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. SG&A expenses increased 16.8 percent in 2021 due primarily to higher selling and marketing spending and the nonrecurrence of $100 million of income in 2020 from a litigation settlement. The increase in 2021 also includes charges related to certain litigation. Restructurings In 2022, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its medical devices, nutritional, diagnostic, and established pharmaceutical businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $234 million of which approximately $59 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $36 million was recorded in Research and development and approximately $139 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, Abbott recognized inventory-related charges of approximately $23 million and fixed assets impairment charges of approximately $4 million related to these restructuring plans. 30 Table of Contents In 2021, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in Abbott's diagnostic, established pharmaceutical, nutritional, and medical device businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $68 million of which approximately $16 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $4 million was recorded in Research and development and approximately $48 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. On May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter of 2021 in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter included fixed asset write-downs of $80 million, inventory-related charges of $248 million, and other exit costs, which included contract cancellations and employee-related costs of $171 million. In the second half of 2021, as the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 spread and the number of new COVID-19 cases increased significantly, particularly in the U.S., demand for rapid COVID-19 tests increased significantly. As a result, in the second half of 2021, Abbott sold approximately $181 million of inventory that was previously estimated to have no net realizable value under the second quarter restructuring action. In addition, the estimate of other exit costs was reduced by a net $58 million as Abbott fulfilled its purchase obligations under certain contracts for which a liability was recorded in the second quarter or Abbott settled with the counterparty in the second half of 2021. Interest Expense and Interest (Income) Interest expense, net decreased $115 million in 2022 due t o the impact of higher interest rates and cash and short-term investment balances on interest income and the repayment of debt in the first quarter of 2022 partially offset by the impact of interest rate hedge contracts related to certain fixed-rate debt. Interest expense, net decreased $10 million in 2021 due to the reduction of interest expense driven by lower interest rates in 2021. The effects of higher cash and short-term investment balances were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates on interest income in 2021. Other (Income) Expense, net Other (income) expense, net includes income of approximat ely $406 million, $270 million, and $205 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. Other (income) expense, net also includes equity investment impairments that totaled approximately $45 million in 2022 and $115 million in 2020 and a gain on the s ale of an equity method investment in 2021. Taxes on Earnings The income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 16.5 percent in 2022, 13.9 percent in 2021, and 10.0 percent in 2020. In 2022, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $43 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and approximately $20 million of net tax expense as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In 2021, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $145 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and approximately $55 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, and approximately $100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $26 million increase to the transition tax liability associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The $26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.53 billion. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining balance of Abbott’s transition tax obligation is approximately $739 million, which will be paid over the next four years as allowed by the TCJA. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2020 reflect the recognition of $24 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. 31 Table of Contents Exclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore, and Malta. Abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules, tax rulings, grants, and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions. Abbott’s future effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in federal, state or international tax laws or tax rulings. In December 2022, the European Union approved a tax directive that instructs its member states to adopt local legislation that ensures that every multinational company pays a minimum 15 percent tax rate in every jurisdiction in which it operates, beginning in 2024. Other non-EU countries have also announced their intentions to adopt a similar policy. Widespread adoption of a minimum tax rate regime could have an unfavorable impact on Abbott’s future effective tax rate. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate. Research and Development Programs Abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development. Research and Development Process In the Established Pharmaceuticals segment, the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment’s existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. As Established Pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity. Depending upon the product, the phases of development may include: • Drug product development. • Phase I bioequivalence studies to compare a future Established Pharmaceutical’s brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). • Phase II studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients. • Phase III studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use. • Phase IV and other post-marketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications. The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to six or more years for complex formulations, new indications, or geographic expansion in specific countries, such as China. In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include: • Discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area, platform, or unmet clinical need. • Concept/Feasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated, testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility. • Development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses. The regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions. In the U.S., the FDA classifies diagnostic products into classes (I, II, or III) and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval. While the Diagnostics segment has products in all three classes, the vast majority of its products are categorized as Class I or Class II. Submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for Class I products. Class II devices typically require pre-market notification to the FDA through a regulatory filing known as a 510(k) submission. Most Class III products are subject to the FDA’s Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. Other Class III products, such as those used to screen blood, require the submission and approval of a Biological License Application (BLA). 32 Table of Contents In the European Union (EU), diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process, which has been governed by the European In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive, depends upon the category, with certain product categories requiring review and approval by an independent company, known as a Notified Body, before the manufacturer can affix a CE mark to the product to declare conformity to the Directive. Other products only require a self-certification process. In 2017, the EU adopted the new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) which replaced the existing directive in the EU for in vitro diagnostic products and imposed additional premarket and post-market regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. In December 2021, the IVDR was amended to extend the regulation’s previous two-year transition period by a range of one to three years, with the transition period extending to May 2027 for certain classes of diagnostic devices. However, the amendment did not delay the date of application of the IVDR itself which took effect on May 26, 2022. In the Medical Devices segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product’s safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications. Similar to the diagnostic products discussed above, in the U.S., medical devices are classified as Class I, II, or III. Most of Abbott’s medical device products are classified as Class II devices that follow the 510(k) regulatory process or Class III devices that are subject to the PMA process. In the EU, medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which had been governed by the European Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, varies by class. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) which replaced the existing directives in the EU for medical devices and imposes additional premarket and post-market regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. The MDR applies to manufacturers as of May 26, 2021 with a transition period until May 26, 2024. Each product must bear a CE mark to show compliance with the MDR. Some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to CE marking of the device. For other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self-certify its ability to apply the CE mark to the product. Outside the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions. After approval and commercial launch of some medical devices, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority. In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product’s efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. In the U.S., the FDA requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products. Prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the FDA’s confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. For other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products. Areas of Focus In 2023 and beyond, Abbott’s significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following: Established Pharmaceuticals — Abbott focuses on building country-specific portfolios made up of high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. Over the next several years, Abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of addressing the health needs of more people in emerging markets and being among the first to launch new off-patent and differentiated medicines. In addition, Abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. Abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as Creon™, Duphaston™, Femoston™ and Influvac™. Depending on the product, the activities focus on development of new data, markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications. 33 Table of Contents Medical Devices — Abbott’s research and development programs focus on: • Cardiac Rhythm Management – Development of next-generation rhythm management technologies, including advanced communication capabilities and leadless pacing therapies. • Heart Failure – Continued enhancements to Abbott’s mechanical circulatory support and pulmonary artery pressure systems, including enhanced clinical performance and usability. • Electrophysiology – Development of next-generation technologies in the areas of ablation, diagnostic, mapping, and visualization and recording. • Vascular – Development of next-generation technologies for use in coronary and peripheral vascular procedures. • Structural Heart – Development of transcatheter and surgical devices for the repair and replacement of heart valves, and occlusion therapies for congenital heart defects and stroke-risk reduction. • Neuromodulation – Development of clinical evidence and next-generation technologies leveraging digital health to support improved patient clinical outcomes, physician engagement, and expanded indications in the treatment of chronic pain, movement disorders and other indications. • Diabetes Care – Develop enhancements and additional indications for the FreeStyle Libre platform of continuous glucose monitoring products to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes and for use beyond diabetes. Nutritionals — Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastrointestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years. Core Laboratory Diagnostics — Abbott continues to commercialize its next-generation blood and plasma screening, immunoassay, clinical chemistry and hematology systems, along with assays, including a focus on unmet medical need, in various areas including but not limited to infectious disease, cardiac care, metabolics, oncology, and neurologic assays as well as informatics solutions to help optimize diagnostics laboratory performance and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories. Molecular Diagnostics — Several new molecular in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests are in various stages of development and launch. Rapid Diagnostics — Abbott’s research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for infectious disease, cardiometabolic disease and toxicology. In addition, the Diagnostics segment is pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory process for various COVID-19 tests for which EUAs were obtained. Given the diversity of Abbott’s business, its intention to remain a broad-based health care company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott’s total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott’s overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott’s 2022 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations. While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott’s ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device, diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is targeted at approximately 7 percent of total Abbott sales in 2023. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period. 34 Table of Contents Goodwill At December 31, 2022, goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled $22.8 billion. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs, using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. The results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities amounted to $9.6 billion, $10.5 billion, and $7.9 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The decrease in Net cash from operating activities in 2022 was primarily due to the unfavorable cash flow impact of an increased investment in working capital partially offset by reduced expenditures related to restructuring actions and lower cash payments for income taxes. The increase in Net cash from operating activities in 2021 was primarily due to the favorable cash flow impact of higher segment operating earnings and improved working capital management partially offset by higher cash taxes paid and the net impact of litigation settlements. A substantial portion of Abbott’s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022, is held by Abbott affiliates outside of the U.S. If these funds were needed for operations in the U.S., Abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds. Abbott funded $413 million in 2022, $418 million in 2021, and $400 million in 2020 to defined benefit pension plans. Abbott expects pension funding of approximately $407 million in 2023 for its pension plans. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbott’s capital expenditures and cash dividends. Debt and Capital At December 31, 2022, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A1 by Moody’s. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. The lines of credit are part of a Five Year Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) that Abbott entered into on November 12, 2020. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on November 12, 2025, and will bear interest, at Abbott’s option, based on either a base rate or Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings. As of December 31, 2022, Abbott's total debt outstanding was $16.8 billion, of which $2.25 billion will mature in 2023. The repayment of the debt maturing in 2023 is expected to be funded from cash on hand. On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55% Notes upon maturity. In 2021, Abbott repaid approximately $195 million on a short-term facility upon maturity. After the repayment, Abbott has no short-term debt. In 2020, financing activities related to the issuance and repayment of long-term debt included the following: • On June 24, 2020, Abbott completed the issuance of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $650 million of its 1.15% Notes due 2028 and $650 million of its 1.40% Notes due 2030. • On September 28, 2020, Abbott repaid the €1.140 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.00% Notes due 2020 upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $1.3 billion. In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. As of December 31, 2022, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion authorization remains available. In October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. This authorization was in addition to the unused portion of a previous share repurchase program that was authorized in 2014. Under the program authorized in 2014, Abbott repurchased 1.6 million shares at a cost of $173 million in 2020. 35 Table of Contents In 2021, Abbott repurchased 16.6 million of its common shares for $2.016 billion which fully utilized the authorization remaining under the 2014 share repurchase program and a portion of the 2019 authorization. In December 2021, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. This authorization was in addition to the $1.081 billion portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2019 that was unused as of December 31, 2021. In 2022, Abbott repurchased 32.3 million of its common shares for $3.65 billion which fully utilized the authorization remaining under the 2019 share repurchase program and a portion of the 2021 authorization. As of December 31, 2022, $2.43 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2021 repurchase program. Abbott declared dividends of $1.92 per share in 2022 compared to $1.82 per share in 2021, an increase of approximately 5.5 percent. Dividends paid were $3.309 billion in 2022 compared to $3.202 billion in 2021. The year-over-year change in dividends paid reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate. Working Capital Working capital was $9.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and $11.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The decrease was due largely to the classification of $2.3 billion of Senior Notes due in 2023 as current liabilities, partially offset by an increase in inventory. Abbott monitors the credit worthiness of customers and establishes an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion in 2022, $1.9 billion in 2021, and $2.2 billion in 2020 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers. 2020 capital expenditures also included the building of capacity for the manufacture of COVID-19 diagnostics tests. Contractual Obligations Abbott believes that its available cash and cash equivalents along with its ability to generate operating cash flow and continued access to debt markets are sufficient to fund existing and planned cash requirements. Abbott's material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: Debt — Principal payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 are $2.3 billion in 2023, $1.1 billion in 2024, $1.5 billion in 2025, $2.9 billion in 2026, $0.6 billion in 2027 and $8.7 billion in 2028 and thereafter. Interest payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 are $567 million in 2023, $525 million in 2024, $493 million in 2025, $462 million in 2026, $391 million in 2027 and $5.4 billion in 2028 and thereafter. Operating leases — As of December 31, 2022, estimated contractual obligations for operating lease payments were $1.341 billion, with $258 million due within 12 months. In addition, Abbott enters into purchase commitments in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements. The majority of outstanding purchase commitments generally do not extend past one year. Contingent Obligations Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. Legislative Issues Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors. 36 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , which requires an entity to report information about its supplier finance program. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2023. Abbott does not expect adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments and Risk Management Market Price Sensitive Investments The fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $9 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2022 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $298 million and $391 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments, as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings. Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $83 million and $90 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $15 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $2.9 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $16.3 billion and $21.2 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.5% and 3.4% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively) with maturities through 2046. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values. Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Abbott held $7.7 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2022 will mature in 2023 or 2024 depending on the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2021 matured in 2022 or will mature in 2023 depending upon the contract. Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Abbott held $12.0 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next 13 months. Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $446 million and $521 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. 38 Table of Contents The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021: 2022 2021 (dollars in millions) Contract Amount Weighted Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) Contract Amount Weighted Average Exchange Rate Fair and Carrying Value Receivable/ (Payable) Primarily U.S. dollars to be exchanged for the following currencies: Euro $ 7,656 1.0664 $ 92 $ 8,698 1.1360 $ 90 Chinese Yuan 2,264 6.8825 12 2,148 6.5744 (35) Japanese Yen 1,797 133.0344 (7) 1,497 111.7260 31 All other currencies 8,029 n/a 89 8,426 n/a 109 Total $ 19,746 $ 186 $ 20,769 $ 195 39 Table of Contents ITEM 8.

Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies NATURE OF BUSINESS — Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. USE OF ESTIMATES — The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for sales rebates, income taxes, pension and other post-employment benefits, valuation of intangible assets, litigation, derivative financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION — The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. REVENUE RECOGNITION — Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Revenue from the launch of a new product, from an improved version of an existing product, or for shipments in excess of a customer’s normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve for such revenue, if necessary. In certain of Abbott’s businesses, primarily within diagnostics, Abbott participates in selling arrangements that include multiple performance obligations (e.g., instruments, reagents, procedures, and service agreements). The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Sales of product rights for marketable products are recorded as revenue upon disposition of the rights. INCOME TAXES — Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when the taxes are paid. No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, the TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Abbott treats the GILTI tax as a period expense and provides for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings. EARNINGS PER SHARE — Unvested restricted stock units and awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 6.905 billion, $ 7.042 billion and $ 4.449 billion, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 6.905 billion, $ 7.042 billion and $ 4.473 billion, respectively. PENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS — Abbott accrues for the actuarially determined cost of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a five-year period. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. 47 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS — For assets and liabilities that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs are valued by reference to similar assets or liabilities, adjusted for contract restrictions and other terms specific to that asset or liability. For these items, a significant portion of fair value is derived by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets. For all remaining assets and liabilities, fair value is derived using a fair value model, such as a discounted cash flow model or Black-Scholes model. Purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value. The fair value of significant purchased intangible assets is based on independent appraisals. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION — The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards and units are amortized over their requisite service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible, with a charge to compensation expense. LITIGATION — Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. Legal fees are recorded as incurred. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS — Cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits, U.S. government securities, money market funds and U.S. treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less. Abbott holds certain investments with a carrying value of $ 169 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments held in a rabbi trust and investments in publicly traded equity securities are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. Investments in equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. TRADE RECEIVABLE VALUATIONS — Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. Accounts receivable are charged off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted. INVENTORIES — Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost includes material and conversion costs. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT — Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table shows estimated useful lives of property and equipment: Classification Estimated Useful Lives Buildings 10 to 50 years Equipment 2 to 20 years PRODUCT LIABILITY — Abbott accrues for product liability claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The liabilities are adjusted quarterly as additional information becomes available. Product liability losses are self-insured. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS — Internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. 48 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) — The initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completed and are then amortized over the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant. CONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES — Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. Product warranties are not significant. Abbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. Note 2 — New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In December 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , which requires an entity to report information about its supplier finance program. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2023. Abbott does not expect adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Note 3 — Revenue Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. 49 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) The following tables provide detail by sales category: 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — Key Emerging Markets $ — $ 3,728 $ 3,728 $ — $ 3,539 $ 3,539 $ — $ 3,209 $ 3,209 Other — 1,184 1,184 — 1,179 1,179 — 1,094 1,094 Total — 4,912 4,912 — 4,718 4,718 — 4,303 4,303 Nutritionals — Pediatric Nutritionals 1,562 1,919 3,481 2,192 2,106 4,298 1,987 2,140 4,127 Adult Nutritionals 1,357 2,621 3,978 1,364 2,632 3,996 1,292 2,228 3,520 Total 2,919 4,540 7,459 3,556 4,738 8,294 3,279 4,368 7,647 Diagnostics — Core Laboratory 1,137 3,751 4,888 1,145 3,983 5,128 1,166 3,309 4,475 Molecular 370 625 995 566 861 1,427 621 817 1,438 Point of Care 372 153 525 384 152 536 369 147 516 Rapid Diagnostics 6,767 3,409 10,176 5,034 3,519 8,553 2,618 1,758 4,376 Total 8,646 7,938 16,584 7,129 8,515 15,644 4,774 6,031 10,805 Medical Devices — Rhythm Management 1,029 1,090 2,119 1,018 1,180 2,198 903 1,011 1,914 Electrophysiology 909 1,018 1,927 778 1,129 1,907 660 918 1,578 Heart Failure 694 226 920 654 235 889 547 193 740 Vascular 864 1,619 2,483 915 1,739 2,654 853 1,486 2,339 Structural Heart 818 894 1,712 730 880 1,610 540 707 1,247 Neuromodulation 619 151 770 616 165 781 564 138 702 Diabetes Care 1,633 3,123 4,756 1,212 3,116 4,328 864 2,403 3,267 Total 6,566 8,121 14,687 5,923 8,444 14,367 4,931 6,856 11,787 Other 11 — 11 34 18 52 38 28 66 Total $ 18,142 $ 25,511 $ 43,653 $ 16,642 $ 26,433 $ 43,075 $ 13,022 $ 21,586 $ 34,608 Products sold by the Diagnostics segment include various types of diagnostic tests to detect the COVID-19 coronavirus. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $ 8.4 billion in 2022, $ 7.7 billion in 2021, and $ 3.9 billion in 2020. Abbott recognizes revenue from product sales upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. For maintenance agreements that provide service beyond Abbott’s standard warranty and other service agreements, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. A time-based measure of progress appropriately reflects the transfer of services to the customer. Payment terms between Abbott and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant. 50 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) Management exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Abbott provides rebates to government agencies, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Other allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott’s historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant. Abbott also applies judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts that include multiple performance obligations. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. For goods or services for which observable standalone selling prices are not available, Abbott uses an expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2022, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 4 billion in the Diagnostic Products segment and approximately $ 432 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, approximately 17 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in ASC 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. Assets Recognized for Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer Abbott has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and records as an expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers in the period of occurrence when the amortization period of the asset that Abbott otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Upfront commission fees paid to sales personnel as a result of obtaining or renewing contracts with customers are incremental to obtaining the contract. Abbott capitalizes these amounts as contract costs. Capitalized commission fees are amortized based on the contract duration to which the assets relate which ranges from two to ten years . The amounts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not significant. Additionally, the cost of transmitters provided to customers that use Abbott’s remote monitoring service with respect to certain medical devices are capitalized as contract costs. Capitalized transmitter costs are amortized based on the timing of the transfer of services to which the assets relate, which typically ranges from eight to ten years . The amounts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not significant. 51 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) Other Contract Assets and Liabilities Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: (in millions) Contract Liabilities: Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 405 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period 615 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ( 500 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 520 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period 578 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ( 598 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 500 Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information Other (income) expense, net , for 2022, 2021 and 2020 include s approximately $ 406 million, $ 270 million and $ 205 million of income, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs ass ociated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. The following summarizes the activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts: (in millions) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 288 Provisions/charges to income 51 Amounts charged off and other deductions ( 26 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 313 Provisions/charges to income 6 Amounts charged off and other deductions ( 57 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 262 The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. 52 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) The detail of various balance sheet components is as follows: (in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Long-term Investments: Equity securities $ 558 $ 748 Other 208 68 Total $ 766 $ 816 The decrease in Abbott’s long-term investments as of December 31, 2022 versus the balance as of December 31, 2021 primarily relates to a decrease in the fair value of investments held in a rabbi trust, the impact of asset impairments and a distribution from an investment held in a joint venture, partially offset by increased investment in long-term time deposits. Abbott’s equity securities as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, include $ 298 million and $ 391 million, respectively, of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. Abbott also holds certain investments as of December 31, 2022 with a carrying value of $ 169 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of $ 83 million that do not have a readily determinable fair va lue. In September 2021, Abbott acquired 100 percent of Walk Vascular, LLC (Walk Vascular), a commercial-stage medical device company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system designed to remove peripheral blood clots. Walk Vascular’s peripheral thrombectomy system has been incorporated into Abbott’s existing endovascular portfolio. The purchase price, the allocation of acquired assets and liabilities, and the revenue and net income contributed by Walk Vascular since the date of acquisition are not material to Abbott’s consolidated financial statements.

Note 6 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 22.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and $ 23.2 billion at December 31, 2021. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by $ 431 million in 2022 and b y $ 532 million in 2021. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at December 31, 2022 was $ 2.7 billion for the Estab lished Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.6 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.2 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There were no reductions of goodwill relating to impairments in 2022 and 2021. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&D acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 807 million and $ 919 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, $ 111 million of impairment charges were recorded on the Research and development line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings related to certain IPR&D intangible assets associated with the Medical Devices business segment. The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $ 27.2 billion and $ 27.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an d accumulated amortization was $ 17.6 billion and $ 15.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. F oreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $ 150 million in 2022 and by $ 197 million in 2021. The estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2022 is approximately $ 2.0 billion in 2023, $ 1.9 billion in 2024, $ 1.7 billion in 2025, $ 1.5 billion in 2026 and $ 1.2 billion in 2027. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over 2 to 20 years. 54 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7 — Restructuring Plans In 2022, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its medical devices, nutritional, diagnostic, and established pharmaceutical businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $ 234 million of which approximately $ 59 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 36 million was recorded in Research and development and approximately $ 139 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, Abbott recognized inventory related charges of approximately $ 23 million and fixed assets impairment charges of approximately $ 4 million related to these restructuring plans. The following summarizes the activity related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accruals as of December 31, 2022: (in millions) Restructuring charges in 2022 $ 234 Payments and other adjustments ( 6 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2022 $ 228 On May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter of 2021 in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $ 499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter included fixed asset write-downs of $ 80 million, inventory-related charges of $ 248 million, and other exit costs, which included contract cancellations and employee-related costs of $ 171 million. In the second half of 2021, as the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 spread and the number of new COVID-19 cases increased significantly, particularly in the U.S., demand for rapid COVID-19 tests increased significantly. As a result, in the second half of 2021, Abbott sold approximately $ 181 million of inventory that was previously estimated to have no net realizable value under the second quarter restructuring action. In addition, the estimate of other exit costs was reduced by a net $ 58 million as Abbott fulfilled its purchase obligations under certain contracts for which a liability was recorded in the second quarter or Abbott settled with the counterparty in the second half of 2021. The following summarizes the activity related to this restructuring action and the status of the related accruals as of December 31, 2022: (in millions) Inventory- Related Charges Fixed Asset Write-Downs Other Exit Costs Total Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 $ 248 $ 80 $ 113 $ 441 Payments — — ( 90 ) ( 90 ) Other non-cash ( 248 ) ( 80 ) — ( 328 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2021 — — 23 23 Payments and other adjustments — — ( 10 ) ( 10 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2022 $ — $ — $ 13 $ 13 55 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7 — Restructuring Plans (Continued) In 2021, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in Abbott's diagnostic, established pharmaceutical, nutritional, and medical device businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $ 68 million of which approximately $ 16 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 4 million was recorded in Research and development and approximately $ 48 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The following summarizes the activity for these restructuring actions and the status of the related accruals as of December 31, 2022: (in millions) Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 $ 68 Payments and other adjustments ( 7 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2021 61 Payments and other adjustments ( 46 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2022 $ 15 Note 8 — Incentive Stock Program The 2017 Incentive Stock Program authorizes the granting of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards, foreign benefits and other share-based awards. Stock options and restricted stock awards and units comprise the majority of benefits that have been granted and are currently outstanding under this program and a prior program. In 2022, Abbott granted 2,634,647 stock options, 514,205 restricted stock awards and 5,487,715 restricted stock units under this program. Under Abbott’s stock incentive programs, the purchase price of shares under option must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the maximum term of an option is 10 years. Options generally vest equally over three years . Restricted stock awards generally vest over three years , with no more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year upon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target. Restricted stock units vest over three years and upon vesting, the recipient receives one share of Abbott stock for each vested restricted stock unit. The aggregate fair market value of options and restricted stock awards and units is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which may be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant. Restricted stock awards and settlement of vested restricted stock units are issued out of treasury shares. Abbott generally issues new shares for exercises of stock options. As a policy, Abbott does not purchase its shares relating to its share-based programs. In April 2017, Abbott’s shareholders authorized the 2017 Incentive Stock Program under which a maximum of 170 million shares were available for issuance. At December 31, 2022, approximately 87 million shares remained available for future issuance. The following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2022.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 85 million, $ 393 million and $ 279 million, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to all share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2022 amounted to approximately $ 494 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . Total non-cash stock compensation expense charged against income from continuing operations in 2022, 2021 and 2020 for share-based plans totaled approximately $ 685 million, $ 640 million and $ 546 million, respectively, and the tax benefit recognized was approximately $ 170 million, $ 267 million and $ 200 million, respectively. Stock compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory is not significant. The table below summarizes the fair value of an option granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the assumptions included in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model used to estimate the fair value: 2022 2021 2020 Fair value $ 25.26 $ 24.17 $ 14.39 Risk-free interest rate 1.9 % 0.8 % 1.3 % Average life of options (years) 6.0 6.0 6.0 Volatility 23.8 % 23.8 % 19.4 % Dividend yield 1.6 % 1.5 % 1.6 % The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates available at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected life. The average life of an option is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Abbott’s stock and historical volatility of Abbott’s stock over the expected life of the option. Dividend yield is based on the option’s exercise price and annual dividend rate at the time of grant. 57 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit The following is a summary of long-term debt at December 31: (in millions) 2022 2021 2.55 % Notes, due 2022 $ — $ 750 0.875 % Notes, due 2023 1,215 1,294 3.40 % Notes, due 2023 1,050 1,050 5 -year term loan due 2024 446 521 0.10 % Notes, due 2024 629 670 3.875 % Notes, due 2025 500 500 2.95 % Notes, due 2025 1,000 1,000 1.50 % Notes, due 2026 1,215 1,294 3.75 % Notes, due 2026 1,700 1,700 0.375 % Notes, due 2027 629 670 1.15 % Notes, due 2028 650 650 1.40 % Notes, due 2030 650 650 4.75 % Notes, due 2036 1,650 1,650 6.15 % Notes, due 2037 547 547 6.00 % Notes, due 2039 515 515 5.30 % Notes, due 2040 694 694 4.75 % Notes, due 2043 700 700 4.90 % Notes, due 2046 3,250 3,250 Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 71 ) ( 78 ) Other, including fair value adjustments relating to interest rate hedge contracts designated as fair value hedges ( 196 ) 23 Total carrying amount of long-term debt 16,773 18,050 Less: Current portion 2,251 754 Total long-term portion $ 14,522 $ 17,296 On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55 % Notes upon maturity. On June 24, 2020, Abbott completed the issuance of $ 1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $ 650 million of its 1.15 % Notes due 2028 and $ 650 million of its 1.40 % Notes due 2030. On September 28, 2020, Abbott repaid the € 1.140 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.00 % Notes due 2021 upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $ 1.3 billion. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $ 5 billion on an unsecured basis. The lines of credit are part of a Five Year Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) that Abbott entered into on November 12, 2020. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on November 12, 2025, and will bear interest, at Abbott’s option, based on either a base rate or Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings. In September 2019, the board of directors approved a bond redemption authorization for the early redemption of up to $ 5 billion of outstanding long-term debt. Of the $ 5 billion authorization, $ 2.15 billion remains available as of December 31, 2022. Principal payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 are $ 2.3 billion in 2023, $ 1.1 billion in 2024, $ 1.5 billion in 2025, $ 2.9 billion in 2026, $ 0.6 billion in 2027 and $ 8.7 billion in 2028 and thereafter. 58 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit (Continued) At December 31, 2022, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A1 by Moody’s. In December 2021, Abbott repaid a short-term facility for approximately $ 195 million. After the repayment, Abbott has no short-term borrowings. Note 10 — Leases Leases where Abbott is the Lessee Abbott has entered into operating leases as the lessee for office space, manufacturing facilities, R&D laboratories, warehouses, vehicles and equipment. Finance leases are not significant. Abbott’s operating leases generally have remaining lease terms of 1 to 10 years. Some leases include options to extend beyond the original lease term, generally up to 10 years and some include options to terminate early. These options have been included in the determination of the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. For all of its asset classes, Abbott elected the practical expedient allowed under FASB ASC No. 842, “Leases” to account for each lease component (e.g., the right to use office space) and the associated non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services) as a single lease component. Abbott also elected the short-term lease accounting policy for all asset classes; therefore, Abbott is not recognizing a lease liability or right of use (ROU) asset for any lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that Abbott is reasonably certain to exercise. As Abbott’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the interest rate used to determine the present value of the payments under each lease typically reflects Abbott’s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. The following table provides information related to Abbott’s operating leases: (in millions, except weighted averages) 2022 2021 2020 Operating lease cost (a) $ 355 $ 359 $ 329 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities 274 287 264 ROU assets arising from entering into new operating lease obligations 263 343 396 Weighted average remaining lease term at December 31 (in years) 8 8 8 Weighted average discount rate at December 31 2.9 % 2.7 % 3.2 % ________________________________________________________ (a) Includes short-term lease expense and variable lease costs, which were immaterial in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Sales-type leases are not significant. Contract terms vary by customer and may include options to terminate the contract or options to extend the contract. Where instruments are provided under operating lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g., reagent) sales. The allocation of revenue between the lease and non-lease components is based on standalone selling prices. Operating lease revenue represented less than 3 percent of Abbott’s total net sales in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Assets related to operating leases are reported within Net property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $ 3.6 billion and $ 1.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $ 3.5 billion and $ 1.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 7.7 billion at December 31, 2022, and $ 8.6 billion at December 31, 2021, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2022 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Abbott held gross notional amounts of $ 12.0 billion and $ 12.2 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5 -year term loan of approximately $ 446 million and $ 521 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. 60 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of December 31: Fair Value — Assets Fair Value — Liabilities (in millions) 2022 2021 Balance Sheet Caption 2022 2021 Balance Sheet Caption Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges: Non-current $ — $ 87 Deferred income taxes and other assets $ 136 $ — Post-employment obligations and other long-term liabilities Current — — 20 — Other accrued liabilities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: Hedging instruments 304 222 Other prepaid expenses and receivables 96 65 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges 108 70 Other prepaid expenses and receivables 130 32 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary — — n/a 446 521 Long-term debt $ 412 $ 379 $ 828 $ 618 The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income.

These amounts are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line. The interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The hedged debt is marked to market, offsetting the effect of marking the interest rate swaps to market. The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of December 31 are shown in the table below. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions. Abbott does not expect any losses from nonperformance by these counterparties. 61 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) 2022 2021 (in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term Investment Securities: Equity securities $ 558 $ 558 $ 748 $ 748 Other 208 208 68 68 Total long-term debt ( 16,773 ) ( 16,313 ) ( 18,050 ) ( 21,152 ) Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts: Receivable position 412 412 292 292 (Payable) position ( 226 ) ( 226 ) ( 97 ) ( 97 ) Interest Rate Hedge Contracts: Receivable position — — 87 87 (Payable) position ( 156 ) ( 156 ) — — The fair value of the debt was determined based on significant other observable inputs, including current interest rates.

The fair value of the debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. Contingent consideration relates to businesses acquired by Abbott. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. The maximum amount for certain contingent consideration is not determinable as it is based on a percent of certain sales. Excluding such contingent consideration, the maximum amount that may be due under the other contingent consideration arrangements was estimated at December 31, 2022 to be approxima tely $ 235 million, w hich is dependent upon attaining certain sales thresholds or upon the occurrence of certain events, such as regulatory approvals. Note 12 — Litigation and Environmental Matters Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 40 million to $ 50 million. The recorded accrual balance at December 31, 2022 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 45 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. 63 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13 — Post-Employment Benefits Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution and medical and dental plans. Information for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: Defined Benefit Plans Medical and Dental Plans (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Projected benefit obligations, January 1 $ 12,773 $ 13,129 $ 1,566 $ 1,567 Service cost — benefits earned during the year 374 391 50 56 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations 300 248 36 33 (Gains) losses, primarily changes in discount rates, plan design changes, law changes and differences between actual and estimated health care costs ( 3,645 ) ( 463 ) ( 437 ) ( 16 ) Benefits paid ( 368 ) ( 340 ) ( 70 ) ( 74 ) Other, including foreign currency translation ( 267 ) ( 192 ) ( 19 ) — Projected benefit obligations, December 31 $ 9,167 $ 12,773 $ 1,126 $ 1,566 Plan assets at fair value, January 1 $ 13,468 $ 12,018 $ 370 $ 353 Actual return (loss) on plan assets ( 1,856 ) 1,521 ( 33 ) 56 Company contributions 413 418 35 35 Benefits paid ( 368 ) ( 340 ) ( 70 ) ( 74 ) Other, including foreign currency translation ( 284 ) ( 149 ) — — Plan assets at fair value, December 31 $ 11,373 $ 13,468 $ 302 $ 370 Projected benefit obligations less (greater) than plan assets, December 31 $ 2,206 $ 695 $ ( 824 ) $ ( 1,196 ) Long-term assets $ 3,200 $ 2,270 $ — $ — Short-term liabilities ( 32 ) ( 31 ) ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Long-term liabilities ( 962 ) ( 1,544 ) ( 822 ) ( 1,194 ) Net asset (liability) $ 2,206 $ 695 $ ( 824 ) $ ( 1,196 ) Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss): Actuarial losses, net $ 1,960 $ 3,062 $ 27 $ 412 Prior service cost (credits) ( 6 ) ( 5 ) ( 33 ) ( 39 ) Total $ 1,954 $ 3,057 $ ( 6 ) $ 373 The $ 3.6 billion and $ 463 million of defined benefit plan gains in 2022 and 2021, respectively, that decreased the projected benefit obligations primarily reflect the year-over-year increases in the discount rates used to measure the obligations. The $ 437 million of medical and dental plan gains in 2022 that decreased the projected benefit obligations primarily reflect the year-over-year increase in the discount rates used to measure the obligations. The projected benefit obligations for non-U.S. defined benefit plans were $ 2.2 billion and $ 3.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligations for all defined benefit plans were $ 8.4 billion and $ 11.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For plans where the projected benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the projected benefit obligations and the aggregate plan assets were as follows: (in millions) 2022 2021 Projected benefit obligation $ 1,270 $ 2,632 Fair value of plan assets 276 1,057 64 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) For plans where the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligations, the projected benefit obligations and the aggregate plan assets were as follows: (in millions) 2022 2021 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 1,044 $ 1,406 Projected benefit obligation 1,134 1,554 Fair value of plan assets 141 136 The components of the net periodic benefit cost were as follows: Defined Benefit Plans Medical and Dental Plans (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Service cost — benefits earned during the year $ 374 $ 391 $ 336 $ 50 $ 56 $ 46 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations 300 248 300 36 33 42 Expected return on plans’ assets ( 931 ) ( 843 ) ( 770 ) ( 30 ) ( 27 ) ( 28 ) Amortization of actuarial losses 231 317 255 11 29 21 Amortization of prior service cost (credits) 1 1 1 ( 24 ) ( 28 ) ( 28 ) Total net cost $ ( 25 ) $ 114 $ 122 $ 43 $ 63 $ 53 Other comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year includes the amortization of actuarial losses and prior service costs (credits) as noted in the previous table. Other comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year also includes: net actuarial gains of $ 858 million for defined benefit plans and a gain of $ 374 million for medical and dental plans in 2022; net actuarial gains of $ 1.141 billion for defined benefit plans and a gain o f $ 45 million for medical and dental plans in 2021 , and net actuarial losses of $ 611 million for defined benefit plans and a gain of $ 23 million for medical and dental plans in 2020. The net actuarial gains in 2022 are primarily due to the year-over-year increase in discount rates partially offset by the impact of 2022 actual asset returns being less than expected returns. The net actuarial gains in 2021 are primarily due to the favorable impact of actual 2021 asset returns in excess of expected returns and the year-over-year increase in discount rates. The net actuarial losses in 2020 are primarily due to the year-over-year decline in discount rates, partially offset by the impact of actual asset returns in excess of expected returns. The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate 5.0 % 2.7 % 2.3 % Expected aggregate average long-term change in compensation 4.5 % 4.3 % 4.3 % The weighted average assumptions used to determine the net cost for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate 2.7 % 2.3 % 3.0 % Expected return on plan assets 7.5 % 7.5 % 7.5 % Expected aggregate average long-term change in compensation 4.4 % 4.3 % 4.3 % The assumed health care cost trend rates for medical and dental plans at December 31 were as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Health care cost trend rate assumed for the next year 7 % 7 % 8 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to 5 % 5 % 5 % Year that rate reaches the assumed ultimate rate 2027 2026 2025 65 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are forward projections of health care costs as of the measurement date.

(i) Primarily investments in private funds, such as private equity, private credit, private real estate and private energy funds. (j) Investments measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet. Equities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. For approximately half of these funds, investments may be redeemed once per week or month, with a required 2 to 30 day notice period. For the remaining funds, daily redemption of an investment is allowed. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry recognized vendors. Abbott did no t have any unfunded commitments related to fixed income funds at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Fixed income securities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. For the majority of these funds, investments may be redeemed either weekly or monthly, with a required 2 to 60 day notice period. For the remaining funds, investments may be generally redeemed daily. Absolute return funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. All private funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund on a one-quarter lag adjusted for known cash flows and significant events through the reporting date. Abbott did no t have any unfunded commitments related to absolute return funds at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Investments in these funds may be generally redeemed monthly or quarterly with required notice periods ranging from 45 to 90 days. For approximately $ 270 million and $ 290 million of the absolute return funds, redemptions are subject to a 33 percent gate and a 25 percent gate, respectively, and $ 70 million is subject to a lock u ntil 2025. Investments in the private funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2023 to 2032. Abbott’s unfunded commitment in these funds was $ 569 million and $ 585 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, as well as balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities with lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The plans do not directly hold any securities of Abbott. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plans’ assets. Abbott’s medical and dental plans’ assets are invested in a similar mix as the pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation percentages at year end are consistent with the company’s targeted asset allocation percentages. The plans’ expected return on assets, as shown above, is based on management’s expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. Abbott funds its domestic pension plans according to IRS funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. Abbott funded $ 413 million in 2022 and $ 418 million in 2021 to defined pension plans. Abbott expects to contribute approximately $ 407 million to its pension plans in 2023. 67 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which includes payments funded from company assets, as well as paid from the plans, are as follows: (in millions) Defined Benefit Plans Medical and Dental Plans 2023 $ 368 $ 67 2024 387 68 2025 406 69 2026 427 71 2027 449 74 2028 to 2032 2,593 409 The Abbott Stock Retirement Plan is the principal defined contribution plan. Abbott’s contributions to this plan were $ 190 million in 2022, $ 181 million in 2021 and $ 164 million in 2020. Note 14 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the annual effective rates, including charges for interest and penalties. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. In 2022, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $ 43 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and approximately $ 20 million of net tax expense as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In 2021, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $ 145 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and approximately $ 55 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $ 170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $ 140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, and approximately $ 100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $ 26 million increase to the transition tax liability associated with the 2017 TCJA. The $ 26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $ 1.53 billion. The one-time transition tax is based on Abbott’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 E&P considered held in cash and other specified assets. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining balance of Abbott’s transition tax obligation is approximately $ 739 million, which will be paid over the next 4 years as allowed by the TCJA. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2020 reflect the recognition of $ 24 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. There are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which are individually significant. Reserves for interest and penalties are not significant. 68 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued) Earnings from continuing operations before taxes, and the related provisions for taxes on earnings from continuing operations, were as follows: (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Taxes: Domestic $ 3,732 $ 3,264 $ 1,588 Foreign 4,574 4,947 3,380 Total $ 8,306 $ 8,211 $ 4,968 (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Taxes on Earnings From Continuing Operations: Current: Domestic $ 1,309 $ 859 $ 39 Foreign 723 790 566 Total current 2,032 1,649 605 Deferred: Domestic ( 610 ) ( 355 ) ( 18 ) Foreign ( 49 ) ( 154 ) ( 90 ) Total deferred ( 659 ) ( 509 ) ( 108 ) Total $ 1,373 $ 1,140 $ 497 Differences between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate were as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Statutory tax rate on earnings from continuing operations 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Impact of foreign operations ( 2.5 ) ( 3.9 ) ( 3.3 ) Impact of TCJA and other related items — — 0.5 Foreign-derived intangible income benefit ( 2.0 ) ( 1.1 ) ( 1.0 ) Domestic impairment loss — ( 0.1 ) ( 2.7 ) Excess tax benefits related to stock compensation ( 0.5 ) ( 1.7 ) ( 1.9 ) Research tax credit ( 0.9 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 1.0 ) Resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years 0.2 ( 0.7 ) ( 2.8 ) Intercompany restructurings and integration — 0.1 0.5 State taxes, net of federal benefit 0.7 0.4 0.5 All other, net 0.5 0.5 0.2 Effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations 16.5 % 13.9 % 10.0 % Impact of foreign operations is primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore, and Malta. 69 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued) The tax effect of the differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (in millions) 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Compensation and employee benefits $ 230 $ 618 Other, primarily reserves not currently deductible, and NOL’s and credit carryforwards 2,402 2,444 Trade receivable reserves 227 206 Research and development costs 319 — Inventory reserves 187 169 Lease liabilities 263 273 Deferred intercompany profit 260 261 Total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 3,888 3,971 Valuation allowance ( 1,169 ) ( 1,199 ) Total deferred tax assets 2,719 2,772 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation ( 376 ) ( 330 ) Right of Use lease assets ( 252 ) ( 264 ) Other, primarily the excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets ( 2,038 ) ( 2,364 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 2,666 ) ( 2,958 ) Total net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 53 $ ( 186 ) Abbott has incurred losses in a foreign jurisdiction where realization of the future economic benefit is so remote that the benefit is not reflected as a deferred tax asset. The following table summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such unrecognized tax benefits were settled: (in millions) 2022 2021 January 1 $ 1,908 $ 1,210 Increase due to current year tax positions 154 143 Increase due to prior year tax positions 108 748 Decrease due to prior year tax positions ( 115 ) ( 119 ) Settlements 3 ( 35 ) Lapse of statute ( 22 ) ( 39 ) December 31 $ 2,036 $ 1,908 The 2021 increase due to prior year tax positions includes approximately $ 714 million of international tax positions for which a deferred tax asset has not been recorded because recognition of the future benefit is not expected. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is approximately $ 1.28 billion. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $ 315 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. 70 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15 — Segment and Geographic Area Information Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.

Abbott’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Abbott’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. Abbott’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 77. Robert B. Ford Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Robert E. Funck, Jr. Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Philip P. Boudreau Vice President, Finance and Controller February 17, 2023 74 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders’ investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 75 Table of Contents Income taxes – Unrecognized tax benefits Description of the Matter As described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2022. Unrecognized tax benefits are assessed by management quarterly for identification and measurement, or more frequently if there are any indicators suggesting a change in unrecognized tax benefits. Assessing tax positions involves judgment including interpreting tax laws of multiple jurisdictions and assumptions relevant to the measurement of an unrecognized tax benefit, including the estimated amount of tax liability that may be incurred should the tax position not be sustained upon inspection by a tax authority. These judgments and assumptions can significantly affect unrecognized tax benefits. How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s identification and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, as well as its process for the assessment of events that may indicate a change in unrecognized tax benefits is warranted. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the completeness of identified unrecognized tax benefits, as well as controls over management’s review of significant assumptions used within the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits. With the support of our tax professionals, among other audit procedures performed, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s judgment with respect to the interpretation of tax laws of multiple jurisdictions by reading and evaluating management’s documentation, including relevant accounting policies, and by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations, and case law, affected management’s judgments. We tested the completeness of management’s assessment of the identification of unrecognized tax benefits and possible outcomes related to it including evaluation of technical merits of the unrecognized tax benefits. We also tested the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and significant assumptions associated with the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, including assessing the estimated amount of tax liability that may be incurred should the tax position not be sustained upon inspection by a tax authority. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. Chicago, Illinois February 17, 2023 76 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 17, 2023 77 Table of Contents ITEM 9.

Abbott’s* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. Established Pharmaceutical Products These products include a broad line of branded generic pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide and marketed and sold outside the United States in emerging markets. These products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with, or licensed from, other companies. The principal products included in the broad therapeutic area portfolios of the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment are: The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment directs its primary marketing efforts toward building strong brands with key stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Government agencies are also important customers. Competition in the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is generally from other health care and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors may increase competitive pressures. * As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the term “Abbott” refers to Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois corporation, or Abbott Laboratories and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. 1 Diagnostic Products These products include a broad line of diagnostic systems and tests manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, clinics, physicians’ offices, retailers, government agencies, alternate care testing sites, and plasma protein therapeutic companies from Abbott owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors. The principal products included in the Diagnostic Products segment are: The Diagnostic Products segment’s products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, instrument warranty provisions, product performance, laboratory efficiency, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. Nutritional Products These products include a broad line of pediatric and adult nutritional products manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to consumers and to institutions, wholesalers, retailers, health care facilities, government agencies, and third-party distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers or third-party distributors. The principal products included in the Nutritional Products segment are: Primary marketing efforts for nutritional products are directed toward consumers or to securing the recommendation of Abbott’s brand of products by physicians or other health care professionals. In addition, nutritional products are also promoted directly to the public by consumer marketing efforts in markets where permitted. 2 Competition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers’ products may increase competitive pressure. Medical Devices These products include a broad line of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care products for people with diabetes, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally marketed and sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, physicians’ offices, and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. The principal products included in the Medical Devices segment are: These products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, product performance, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. 3 INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ABBOTT’S BUSINESS IN GENERAL Sources and Availability of Raw Materials Abbott purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to Abbott’s operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and around the world. Due to disruptions to the global supply chain caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott has experienced availability issues with some materials and electronic components. To date, Abbott has been able to manage these challenges without significant supply disruptions or shortages for raw materials and supplies. A more detailed discussion on the COVID-19 pandemic’s disruption of the global supply chain and its resulting impact on Abbott’s business is contained in “ Abbott is subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic. ” in “Economic and Industry Risk” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses Abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products. Accordingly, where possible, patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for Abbott’s products in the United States and countries of interest to Abbott. Abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications. Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 through 3. These, and various patents which expire during the period 2022 to 2042, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Abbott’s business. Abbott believes that no single patent, license, or trademark is material in relation to Abbott’s business as a whole. Seasonal Aspects, Customers, and Renegotiation There are no significant seasonal aspects to Abbott’s business. Abbott has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on Abbott. No material portion of Abbott’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government. Environmental Matters Abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal, state, and various other countries’ environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. Abbott’s capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2021 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2022. Abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which are owned by Abbott, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, Abbott believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Human Capital The sustainability of Abbott’s business depends on attracting, engaging and developing talented people with diverse backgrounds who share Abbott’s mission to help people live their healthiest possible lives. Abbott provides its employees opportunities to grow and develop their careers, market competitive compensation and benefit programs, and the satisfaction of being part of a global company dedicated to improving health in more than 160 countries. As of December 31, 2021, Abbott employed approximately 113,000 people, 70% of whom were employed outside of the U.S. Women represented 47% of Abbott’s U.S. workforce, 45% of its global workforce, and 40% of its managers. Health and Safety The health, safety and wellness of its employees is an Abbott priority embedded at every level of its business. Abbott’s integrated Environmental, Health and Safety organization governs health, safety and wellness at Abbott’s facilities. Abbott also maintains global policies and standards for managing employee health and safety. 4 Abbott takes a holistic approach to employee well-being. Abbott’s global wellness programs are designed to meet the unique needs of employees across businesses and geographies and offer a wide range of programs, including supporting the mental, financial and physical health of employees and their families. For example, for over 20 years, Abbott has annually offered Exercise Across Abbott, which is a four-week physical wellness program that encourages employees to team up with colleagues and track how many minutes they exercise each day. Over 21,000 Abbott employees across 73 countries took part in 2021. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees, including providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment and at many facilities, providing vaccinations, providing and requiring onsite COVID-19 testing, and implementing social distancing. In some locations, employees also have received free over-the-counter COVID-19 tests for at-home use. Talent Management Abbott has an integrated global talent management process that is designed to identify and assess talent across the organization and provide equal and consistent opportunities for employees to develop their skills. All levels of employees participate in Abbott’s annual performance management process to create development plans that support their particular career objectives, and Abbott provides a broad range of training, mentoring and other development opportunities to help its employees meet these objectives. The board of directors conducts an annual Talent Management Review, focusing on development of talent, diversity, and succession planning for critical positions. Similar reviews take place at every level of Abbott to develop talent and diversity across the organization. Diversity and Inclusion Abbott is committed to developing a workplace that is inclusive for all. Abbott ties executive compensation to human capital management, including diversity outcomes, to sustain an inclusive culture and the fair and balanced treatment of Abbott’s employees. In 2021, Abbott issued its first-ever diversity, equity, and inclusion report, which describes Abbott’s plans, strategies, and actions to fulfill its commitment to develop an inclusive workplace. Abbott’s employee networks play an important role in building an inclusive culture across all Abbott operations. A member of Abbott’s senior management serves as a sponsor for each of these networks, helping to align their objectives with Abbott’s business strategies. Abbott has ten such networks, which are: Advancing Professionals Network (supporting early career employees), Asian Leadership and Cultural Network, Black Business Network, Flex Network (supporting employees with part-time and flexible schedules), LA VOICE Network (supporting Hispanic and Latino employees), disABILITY Network (supporting people with disabilities), PRIDE (supporting LGBTQ employees), Veterans Network, Women Leaders of Abbott, and Women in STEM. All Abbott employees are encouraged to join any of the employee networks. Abbott offers professional development programs, which provide recent college graduates the opportunity to rotate through different areas of Abbott, often with the chance to work outside their home country. In 2021, 50% of the participants were women. Also, Abbott hosts hundreds of college students for paid internships. In 2021, 58% of the U.S. interns were women and 48% were minorities. Further, Abbott has offered a STEM internship program for high school students in the U.S. since 2012 and beginning in 2021, students who complete the program are eligible to receive college credit for their experience. The program’s objective is to increase the number of students pursuing STEM-related careers and contribute to a more diverse talent pipeline for Abbott. In 2021, 62% of the STEM interns were women and 68% were minorities. Compensation and Benefits Abbott is committed to building, retaining, and motivating a diverse talent pipeline that can meet the current and future needs of its businesses. To that end, Abbott provides market competitive compensation, healthcare benefits, continuing education benefits, pension and/or retirement savings plans, financial support for employees with student loan debt, and several programs to facilitate employees building an ownership stake in Abbott, including a global long-term incentive program for employees generally beginning at the manager level. Abbott also has procedures and processes focused on ensuring employees receive equitable compensation, regardless of race or gender or other personal characteristics. 5 Regulation The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott’s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar international regulatory agencies. Government regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott’s products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott’s clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many pandemic-related products (including diagnostic tests) were authorized by regulators for emergency use solely during the pandemic. In addition, many governments enacted policies to expedite or promote access to health care in order to slow or stop the spread of the virus. Examples include expansion of telehealth coverages and increased reimbursements for diagnostic testing. It is uncertain when the public health emergency will end and to what extent these policies will continue or revert back to previous policies. Abbott’s international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott’s investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products. Abbott’s laboratory facilities, home monitoring services,and durable medical equipment suppliers, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to third-party payors. In the United States, Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria. Abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott’s business. Among other effects, health care regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Device Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions, including suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory’s certification, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties. Abbott’s business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. 6 Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in many countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. Abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products. Many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, or coverage limitations. Budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on Abbott’s products for the foreseeable future. In the United States, the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices, diagnostics, supplies, and other products, as well as the procedures in which these products may be used. The government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home, and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time. For example, Medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment (including diabetes products), enteral nutrition products, and supplies. Additionally, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act established a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests in 2018. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. In October 2018, the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required, beginning with reports filed in 2022. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. Policy changes or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to health care systems. In the United States, this could include potential modification, including expansion or repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act. The regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information (including patient health information, financial information and other sensitive personal information), is increasing. For example, the European Union, China, various other countries, and various U.S. states (e.g., California, Virginia, and Colorado) have enacted data protection laws that contain significant compliance obligations and financial penalties for noncompliance. In addition, regulators with general consumer protection authority, such as the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. states Attorneys General, are focused on how consumer data is used by entities in the health care industry. Further, there are regulations of data privacy and security that are specific to health care companies. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information, and the FDA has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices. In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering “data localization” laws, which limit companies’ ability to transfer protected data across country borders. Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties. Transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended, and Abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area. Governmental cost containment efforts also affect Abbott’s nutritional products business. In the United States, for example, under regulations governing the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula. As a result, through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program. Abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture, quality assurance requirements, marketing authorization processes, post-market surveillance requirements, availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services, as well as data privacy and security. Abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing health care products or services to market, access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical, nutrition, diagnostic, and medical device industries, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. 7 INTERNET INFORMATION Copies of Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through Abbott’s investor relations website ( www.abbottinvestor.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after Abbott electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission). These reports and other information are also available, free of charge, at www.sec.gov.

RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott’s securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott’s actual results. Abbott’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Business and Operational Risks Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott’s credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity. Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s results of operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties. Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties. Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Similarly, there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers like Abbott. Any significant breach, attack or other disruption involving Abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business. 9 Abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested. Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott’s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer. The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer. The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or the global supply chain, cyber attacks, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability. Abbott has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility. As of December 31, 2021, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $18.1 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Further, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition. Additionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility. 10 Legal and Regulatory Risks Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. Abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, diagnostic product, or nutritional product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs. In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott’s products, and criminal prosecution. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott’s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott’s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability and financial condition. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. Abbott’s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott’s business. Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott’s products’ coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott’s products or the prices that Abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them. Further, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services. These provisions may be modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law. For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” The expiration or loss of intellectual property protection and licenses may affect Abbott’s future revenues and operating income. Many of Abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott’s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott’s intellectual property rights, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “Legal Proceedings.” 11 Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition. Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for, or injury to, patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition. Economic and Industry Risks Abbott is subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic. As a global healthcare company, public health crises, such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact Abbott's operations. Health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause significant reductions in demand for certain products, increased difficulty in serving customers, disrupt manufacturing and supply chains, and negatively affect Abbott’s operations as well as the operations of its suppliers, distributors and other third-party partners. Furthermore, such widespread outbreaks may impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Abbott's diversified health care business in various ways, with some businesses performing at the levels required to successfully meet new demands, other having faced challenges during periods when the number of COVID-19 cases significantly increased, and still others being relatively less impacted by the pandemic. With regard to COVID-19 diagnostic testing, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for several COVID-19 related products in 2020 and 2021, including Abbott diagnostic tests. EUAs are authorized for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency unless sooner terminated or revoked. Abbott is actively pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory approval process for various COVID-19 diagnostic tests which has uncertainty as discussed in “ Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. ” in “Legal and Regulatory Risks” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Further, the demand for COVID-19 tests has been, and Abbott expects it to continue to be, highly volatile, primarily driven by the emergence and severity of new variants, which are unpredictable. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to global supply chain disruptions, which has adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services. While Abbott has taken actions to offset some of these inflationary pressures in its supply chain, Abbott may not be able to completely offset all the increases in its operational costs. Further, Abbott has experienced, and may continue to experience, availability issues with some services and materials used in its products. To date, Abbott has been able to manage these challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for services, raw materials and supplies, however, no assurance can be given that these efforts will continue to be successful. Significant disruptions or shortages may result in Abbott’s inability to meet customer demand for certain of its products. Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. A more detailed discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott’s business is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. 12 Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income. In the United States and other countries, Abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “Regulation.” To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Competitors’ intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition. In the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of patent litigation, such as competitor claims that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition. New products and technological advances by Abbott’s competitors may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations. Abbott’s products face intense competition from competitive products. Competitors’ products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott’s products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products. Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect Abbott’s financial statements and its ability to realize projected sales and earnings. Although Abbott’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2021 made up approximately 61 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott’s assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks. Information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott’s financial results is contained in the “Financial Review — Results of Operations” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott’s 2021 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in this report. Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott’s customers depend on payment by government health care systems. The international nature of Abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. Abbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2021 made up approximately 61 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott’s international operations include: 13 Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect Abbott’s profitability and its financial condition, including: ​ ​ 14 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, and projections. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” variations of these words, and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Certain factors, including but not limited to those identified under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, estimates, projections, forecasts, and from past results.

Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as the result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. ​ ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ​ ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2021, Abbott owned or leased properties totaling approximately 43 million square feet, of which approximately 65% is owned by Abbott. Abbott’s principal corporate offices are located in Illinois and are owned by Abbott. Abbott operates 90 manufacturing facilities globally. Abbott’s facilities are deemed suitable and provide adequate productive capacity. The manufacturing facilities are used by Abbott’s reportable segments as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Manufacturing Reportable Segments ​ Sites Medical Devices 27 Diagnostic Products 24 Established Pharmaceutical Products 25 Nutritional Products 14 Worldwide Total 90 ​ Abbott’s research and development facilities in the United States are primarily located in California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Ohio. Abbott also has research and development facilities in various other countries, including China, Colombia, India, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. There are no material encumbrances on the properties. ​ ​ 15 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Abbott is involved in various claims, legal proceedings, and investigations, including (as of January 31, 2022) those described below. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Abbott is a defendant in numerous lawsuits involving certain of its specialty infant formula products administered to preterm infants. The lawsuits allege that preterm infants developed necrotizing enterocolitis as a result of being administered a cow’s milk-based preterm infant formula product, which resulted in personal injuries or death. As of January 31, 2022, there were 68 lawsuits pending in federal and state courts in which Abbott is a party. The plaintiffs seek various damages, including punitive damages. In January 2022, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation was asked to consolidate the federal court cases for pretrial purposes. In addition, on December 15, 2021, a purported class of Canadian preterm infants filed suit in British Columbia making similar allegations against Abbott. These plaintiffs seek various damages, including punitive damages. Many of the lawsuits name another infant formula manufacturer as a co-defendant. In June and July 2021, DexCom, Inc. (DexCom) initiated patent infringement litigation against Abbott over certain of Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring products, including those under the FreeStyle brand, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and in the Regional Court of Mannheim in Germany. In both jurisdictions, DexCom seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages. In all cases, Abbott asserts that it has a license to each of Dexcom’s asserted patents and that the patents are invalid and not infringed. In July 2021, Abbott sued DexCom for patent infringement over certain of DexCom’s continuous glucose monitoring products in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, the Regional Courts of Mannheim and Dusseldorf in Germany, and the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom. Abbott seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages. In December 2021, Abbott filed a breach of contract suit against DexCom in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that DexCom breached the parties’ 2014 Settlement and License Agreement by asserting infringement of patents against Abbott that DexCom previously licensed to Abbott. ​ ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and the measurement of net sales and costs is impacted by foreign currency translation. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. Sales in international markets comprise approximately 61 percent of consolidated net sales. In 2020 and 2021, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected Abbott’s diversified health care businesses in various ways. As is further described below, some businesses have performed at the levels required to successfully meet new demands, others have faced challenges during periods when the number of COVID-19 cases significantly increased, and still others have been relatively less impacted by the pandemic. Abbott’s Diagnostics segment experienced the most significant change in sales from 2019 to 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 and 2021, Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch various new diagnostic tests for COVID-19. In March 2020, Rapid Diagnostics launched a molecular test to detect COVID-19 on its ID NOW ® rapid point-of-care platform in the U.S. pursuant to an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). In August 2020, Abbott launched its BinaxNOW ® COVID-19 Ag Card test, a portable, lateral flow rapid test to detect COVID-19 pursuant to an EUA in the U.S. In December 2020, Abbott received an EUA in the U.S. for virtually guided at-home use of its BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card rapid test and launched the product for at-home use. In March 2021, Abbott announced that it had received an EUA in the U.S. for its over-the-counter, non-prescription BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Self Test for individuals with or without symptoms. In the first quarter of 2021, Abbott also received EUAs in the U.S. that allow the non-prescription use of the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card Home Test and the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test for professional use for individuals with or without symptoms. Outside the U.S., in September 2020, Rapid Diagnostics launched its Panbio ® rapid antigen test to detect COVID-19 pursuant to a CE Mark. In October 2020, Abbott received approval by the World Health Organization for emergency use listing for the Panbio antigen test. In January 2021, Abbott received CE Mark for two new uses of its Panbio rapid antigen test: asymptomatic testing and self-swabbing under the supervision of a healthcare worker. In June 2021, Abbott announced that it had received CE Mark for its over-the-counter Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test for individuals with or without symptoms. In 2020, Molecular Diagnostics developed and launched molecular tests to detect COVID-19 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods on its m2000 ® RealTi m e lab-based platform and its Alinity ® m system pursuant to EUAs in the U.S. and CE Marks. Molecular Diagnostics also developed and launched its multiplex molecular test on its Alinity m system to detect COVID-19, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in one test. This multiplex molecular test was launched pursuant to a CE Mark in December 2020 and an EUA in the U.S. in March 2021. In 2020 and 2021, Core Laboratory Diagnostics developed and launched various lab-based serology blood tests on its ARCHITECT ® i1000SR ® and ARCHITECT i2000SR ® laboratory instruments and on its Alinity i system for the detection of an antibody to determine if someone was previously infected with the virus. The tests were launched under EUAs in the U.S. and CE Marks. In 2020 and 2021, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $3.9 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, led by sales related to Abbott’s BinaxNOW, Panbio and ID NOW rapid testing platforms. 2021 volumes were affected by fluctuations in the number of COVID-19 cases, especially in the U.S., over the course of the year. In the second quarter of 2021, demand for COVID-19 tests decreased from the previous quarter as COVID-19 vaccines were administered, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations declined, and the U.S. health authority updated its guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. However, in the second half of 2021, as the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 spread and the number of new COVID-19 cases increased, demand for rapid COVID-19 tests increased significantly. With respect to other products sold by the Diagnostics segment, demand for routine diagnostic testing generally fluctuated as the number of COVID-19 cases changed in various geographic regions throughout the two-year period. In 2020, in addition to negatively impacting routine core diagnostic testing volumes, the pandemic negatively affected the number of cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures performed by health care providers globally, thereby reducing the demand for Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices and routine diagnostic tests. The decrease began in February 2020 in China as that country implemented quarantine restrictions and postponed non-emergency health care activities. The negative impact on cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures and routine diagnostic tests expanded to other countries and geographic regions as COVID-19 spread geographically in the first half of 2020 and health care systems in these countries shifted their focus to fighting COVID-19. 22 The extent of the impact and the timing of a recovery in the number of procedures and routine testing in a particular country or geographic region depended upon the progression of COVID-19 cases in that country or region as well as the actions taken by the government in that country related to COVID-19. In 2020, the recovery in procedures and routine testing volumes in China began in March 2020. In other parts of the world, such as the U.S. and Europe, volumes improved across Abbott’s hospital-based businesses as the second quarter progressed and the improvement continued in the third quarter. However, in the fourth quarter of 2020, the improving trends in the demand for procedures and routine testing flattened or were negatively impacted depending upon the business and the region as many countries, including the U.S., experienced an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. While routine diagnostic testing and cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedure volumes were negatively impacted early in 2021 by elevated COVID-19 case rates, overall volumes improved over the course of the year until the latter part of 2021 when demand softened in several geographies with the emergence of another variant. While Abbott’s branded generic pharmaceuticals business was also negatively affected by the pandemic in 2020 as COVID-19 spread across emerging market countries in the second and third quarters of 2020, volumes recovered and grew in 2021. Abbott’s nutritional and diabetes care businesses were the least affected by the pandemic as is further discussed below. Abbott is continually monitoring the effects of the pandemic on its operations. Throughout the pandemic, Abbott has continued to ensure that its operations throughout the world are aligned with the specific governmental orders and guidelines affecting each location. Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure to COVID-19 and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees. The demand for COVID-19 tests has been highly volatile. Abbott expects this volatility to continue as the possible emergence and severity of new variants are unpredictable. Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which the pandemic will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. While Abbott’s 2021 and 2020 sales were most significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in total sales over the last three years also reflects the introduction of new products across various businesses as well as higher sales of various existing products. Sales in emerging markets, which represent approximately 35 percent of total company sales, increased 19.6 percent in 2021 and 2.0 percent in 2020, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. (Emerging markets include all countries except the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.) Over the last three years, Abbott’s operating margin as a percentage of sales increased from 14.2 percent in 2019 to 15.5 percent in 2020 and 19.6 percent in 2021. The increase in 2021 from 2020 reflects the impact of sales volume increases for COVID-19 tests in Rapid Diagnostics and growth across virtually all of Abbott’s businesses due, in part, to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges on various manufacturing inputs and transportation costs, an increase in restructuring costs, and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The increase in 2020 reflects the sales volume increases in the rapid and molecular diagnostics businesses, partially offset by lower Medical Devices sales due to the impact of the pandemic and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. In addition, a reduction in the costs associated with business acquisitions and restructuring activities drove an improvement in operating margins from 2019 to 2020. In 2021, Abbott experienced availability issues with some services and materials used in its products. To date, Abbott has been able to manage the various supply chain challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for services, raw materials and supplies. While Abbott expects inflationary pressures on various raw materials, packaging materials and transportation costs to continue in 2022, the impact of such cost increases is expected to be at least partially mitigated by price increases in certain businesses and the impact of continued gross margin improvement initiatives. To the extent that supply chain challenges in the industries in which Abbott operates normalize over time, this may lessen inflationary pressures. With respect to the performance of each reportable segment over the last three years, sales in the Medical Devices segment, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 19.4 percent in 2021 and decreased 3.8 percent in 2020. The sales increase in 2021 was driven by double-digit growth across all of Abbott’s Medical Devices divisions, led by Diabetes Care, Structural Heart and Electrophysiology. The sales decrease in 2020 was driven by Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due primarily to reduced procedure volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care. In 2021, operating earnings for the Medical Devices segment increased 48.6 percent. The operating margin profile increased from 30.8 percent of sales in 2019 to 31.4 percent in 2021 primarily due to higher sales volumes in Diabetes Care and Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses. This growth was partially offset by pricing pressures on drug eluting stents (DES) as a result of market competition in the U.S. and other major markets. 23 In 2021, key product approvals in the Medical Devices segment included: In Abbott’s worldwide diagnostics business, sales increased 42.7 percent in 2021 and 40.6 percent in 2020, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As was discussed above, sales growth in 2021 was driven by demand for Abbott's portfolio of rapid diagnostics tests for COVID-19 and higher routine diagnostics testing in the core laboratory business, partially offset by lower demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based tests for COVID-19 in the molecular diagnostics business. Growth in 2020 was driven by demand for Abbott's portfolio of COVID-19 diagnostics tests across its rapid and lab-based platforms, partially offset by lower volumes of routine laboratory testing due to the pandemic. Abbott has regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, China, and other markets for the “Alinity c” and “Alinity i” instruments and has continued to build out its test menu for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics. Abbott has obtained regulatory approval for the “Alinity h” instrument for hematology in Europe and Japan. Abbott has also obtained regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe and other markets for the “Alinity s” (blood screening) and “Alinity m” (molecular) instruments and several testing assays. In 2021, operating earnings for the Diagnostics segment increased 68.0 percent. The operating margin profile increased from 24.8 percent of sales in 2019 to 40.0 percent in 2021 primarily due to higher sales in Rapid Diagnostics in 2020 and 2021 and increased routine diagnostics testing in 2021 in Core Laboratory Diagnostics. In Abbott’s worldwide nutritional products business, sales over the last three years were positively impacted by numerous new product introductions, including the roll-outs of human milk oligosaccharide, or HMO, in infant formula, that leveraged Abbott’s strong brands. Sales over the last two years were also positively impacted by consumers’ interest in nutrients that help support their immune systems. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total adult nutrition sales increased 12.8 percent in 2021 and 10.3 percent in 2020, led by the continued growth of Ensure ® , Abbott’s market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna ® , Abbott’s market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand, across several countries. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total pediatric nutrition sales increased 3.3 percent in 2021 and 0.3 percent in 2020 driven by the Pedialyte ® , PediaSure ® and Similac ® brands in the U.S. as well as infant and toddler product growth across several international markets, partially offset by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China. Operating margins for the worldwide nutritional products business decreased from 23.0 percent in 2019 to 21.3 percent in 2021. The decrease was driven by higher manufacturing and distribution costs, including commodity prices, partially offset by the impact of gross margin improvement initiatives. The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Established Pharmaceutical sales increased 10.4 percent in 2021 and 1.9 percent in 2020. The sales increases in 2021 and 2020 reflect higher sales in several geographies including India, China, Brazil and Russia. Operating margins decreased from 20.1 percent of sales in 2019 to 18.8 percent in 2021 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, higher product costs and product mix, partially offset by the impact of gross margin improvement initiatives. With respect to Abbott’s financial position, at December 31, 2021, Abbott’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments total approximately $10.2 billion compared to $7.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Abbott’s long-term debt and short-term borrowings total $18.1 billion and $18.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Abbott declared dividends of $1.82 per share in 2021 compared to $1.53 per share in 2020, an increase of approximately 19 percent. Dividends paid totaled $3.202 billion in 2021 compared to $2.560 billion in 2020. The year-over-year change in the amount of dividends paid primarily reflects the increase in the dividend rate. In December 2021, Abbott increased the company’s quarterly dividend by 4.4 percent to $0.47 per share from $0.45 per share, effective with the dividend paid in February 2022. In December 2020, Abbott increased the company’s quarterly dividend by 25 percent to $0.45 per share from $0.36 per share, effective with the dividend paid in February 2021. 24 In 2022, Abbott will focus on continuing to meet the demand for COVID-19 tests and will continue to invest in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth over the next several years. In its diagnostics business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving market adoption and geographic expansion of its Alinity suite of diagnostics instruments. In the Medical Devices segment, Abbott will focus on expanding its market position across the various businesses. In its nutritionals business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving growth globally and further enhancing its portfolio with the introduction of line extensions of its science-based products. In the established pharmaceuticals business, Abbott will continue to focus on growing its business with the depth and breadth of its portfolio in emerging markets. Critical Accounting Policies Sales Rebates — In 2021, approximately 45 percent of Abbott’s consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances in 2021 are in the Nutritional Products and Diabetes Care businesses. Abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019 amounted to approximately $3.9 billion, $3.3 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, or 17.5 percent, 20.1 percent and 19.1 percent of gross sales, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $22.3 billion, $16.6 billion and $16.3 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one-percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $223 million in 2021. Abbott considers a one-percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $268 million, $207 million and $169 million for cash discounts in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $211 million, $232 million and $192 million for returns in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott’s historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals. In the WIC business, estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott holds the WIC contract. The state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price, is reliably determinable. Rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years. Except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the states submitting rebate claims. The USDA, which administers the WIC program, has been making its data available for many years. Management also estimates the states' processing lag time based on sales and claims data. Inventory in the retail distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management has access to several large customers' inventory management data, which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel. At December 31, 2021, Abbott had WIC business in 36 states. Historically, adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. 25 Income Taxes — Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items is often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. In accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. Pension and Post-Employment Benefits — Abbott offers pension benefits and post-employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for years, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. The impact of higher interest rates and improved asset returns during 2021 significantly decreased the net actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 2021, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were net losses of $3.1 billion for Abbott’s defined benefit plans and net losses of $373 million for Abbott’s medical and dental plans. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post-employment benefits. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five-year period. Valuation of Intangible Assets — Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott’s critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. At December 31, 2021, goodwill amounted to $23.2 billion and net intangibles amounted to $12.7 billion. Amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $2.0 billion in 2021, $2.1 billion in 2020 and $1.9 billion in 2019. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Litigation — Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $30 million to $45 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Accruals of approximately $40 million have been recorded at December 31, 2021 for these proceedings and exposures. These accruals represent management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” ​ 26 Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last two years: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Components of % Change ​ ​ Total ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2021 vs. 2020 24.5 (1.5) 24.4 1.6 2020 vs. 2019 8.5 (0.4) 10.2 (1.3) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total U.S. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 vs. 2020 27.8 (1.9) 29.7 — 2020 vs. 2019 14.2 (1.1) 15.3 — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total International ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 vs. 2020 22.5 (1.3) 21.2 2.6 2020 vs. 2019 5.3 0.1 7.2 (2.0) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Established Pharmaceutical Products Segment ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 vs. 2020 9.6 4.2 6.2 (0.8) 2020 vs. 2019 (4.1) 2.7 (0.8) (6.0) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritional Products Segment ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 vs. 2020 8.5 1.0 6.7 0.8 2020 vs. 2019 3.2 0.8 3.9 (1.5) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostic Products Segment ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 vs. 2020 44.8 (6.2) 48.9 2.1 2020 vs. 2019 40.1 (0.8) 41.4 (0.5) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices Segment ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 vs. 2020 21.9 (0.9) 20.3 2.5 2020 vs. 2019 (3.7) (1.9) (1.9) 0.1 ​ The increase in Total Net Sales in 2021 reflects volume growth across all of Abbott’s segments. In 2021, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $7.7 billion led by combined sales of approximately $6.6 billion related to Abbott’s BinaxNOW, Panbio, and ID NOW rapid testing platforms. In 2021, excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 15.2 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales in 2021 increased 13.7 percent. The price decline related to the Diagnostic Products segment in 2021 primarily reflects lower pricing for COVID-19 tests. The increase in Total Net Sales in 2020 reflects volume growth in the Diagnostics and Nutritional Products segments. In 2020, COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $3.9 billion. In Medical Devices, the 2020 impact of COVID-19 on Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses was partially offset by double-digit volume growth in Diabetes Care. The price declines related to the Medical Devices segment in 2021 and 2020 primarily reflect DES pricing pressures as a result of market competition in the U.S. and other major markets. 27 A comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total Impact of Total Change ​ ​ 2021 2020 Change Exchange Excl.

Total Established Pharmaceutical Products sales increased 10.4 percent in 2021 and 1.9 percent in 2020, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is focused on several key emerging markets including India, Russia, China and Brazil. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total sales in these key emerging markets increased 11.9 percent in 2021 and 2.6 percent in 2020 due to higher sales in several geographies including India, China, Russia and Brazil. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales in Established Pharmaceuticals’ other emerging markets increased 6.0 percent in 2021 and decreased 0.5 percent in 2020. Total Nutritional Products sales increased 7.7 percent in 2021 and 4.7 percent in 2020, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In 2021, International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 3.2 percent as lower sales in China, the Middle East and various countries in Southeast Asia were partially offset by higher volumes sold in various countries in Latin America and Europe. The 4.1 percent decrease in 2020 International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was due to challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China that more than offset growth across Abbott’s pediatric products in various countries in Southeast Asia. In the U.S. Pediatric Nutritional business, sales increased 10.3 percent in 2021 and 5.8 percent in 2020, reflecting growth in Pedialyte, Similac and PediaSure. In International Adult Nutritionals, sales increased 17.0 percent and 13.6 percent in 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to continued growth of Ensure and Glucerna in several countries. U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 5.6 percent in 2021, primarily due to growth of Ensure and Glucerna. In 2020, U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 4.9 percent, primarily due to growth of Ensure. 29 In the Diagnostics segment, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 12.4 percent in 2021 and decreased 2.8 percent in 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In 2021, growth was driven by increased volume of routine diagnostic testing performed in hospitals and other laboratories, partially offset by lower sales of Abbott’s laboratory-based tests for the detection of the IgG and IgM antibodies, which determine if someone was previously infected with the COVID-19 virus. In 2020, the decrease was due to the lower volume of routine testing performed in hospital and other laboratories due to COVID-19, partially offset by sales of Abbott’s COVID-19 laboratory-based tests for the detection of the IgG and IgM antibodies. Core Laboratory Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were $204 million and $262 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 16.9 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 14.4 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. In Molecular Diagnostics, sales decreased 2.9 percent and increased 225.7 percent in 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In 2021, the decrease was due to lower demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 on its m2000 platform, partially offset by growth in the base business from the continued roll-out of the Alinity m platform. In 2020, the increase reflects higher volumes due to demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19. Abbott received U.S. FDA approval in March 2020 for its Alinity m molecular diagnostics system. Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $891 million and $1.0 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 29.2 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 27.0 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 93.3 percent and 112.3 percent in 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to strong demand for Abbott’s point-of-care COVID-19 molecular test on its ID NOW platform and its BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test in the U.S. as well as international demand for COVID-19 rapid tests on its Panbio platform. The sales increase for 2021 also included the recovery of routine diagnostic testing. The sales increase for 2020 also included increased testing in the first quarter for the flu in the U.S., partially offset by the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on routine diagnostic testing in 2020. Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $6.6 billion and $2.6 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, Rapid Diagnostics sales increased 10.4 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 9.2 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. In Medical Devices, sales increased 19.4 percent and decreased 3.8 percent in 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In 2021, the increase was driven by double-digit growth across all divisions, led by Diabetes Care, Structural Heart and Electrophysiology. In 2020, double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was more than offset by decreases in Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower vascular sales in China in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of a new national tender program. The 2021 and 2020 growth in Diabetes Care revenue was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre, Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, internationally and in the U.S. In 2021, FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $3.7 billion, which reflected a 36.8 percent increase over 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. FreeStyle Libre sales in 2020 were $2.6 billion, which reflected a 42.6 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over 2019 when sales totaled $1.8 billion. While procedure volumes across Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were negatively impacted early in 2021 by elevated COVID-19 case rates in certain countries, including the U.S., overall volumes improved over the course of 2021 across various businesses. The year-over-year increases in the various businesses reflect a recovery from the 2020 levels when the pandemic reduced procedure volumes as well as sales growth from pre-pandemic levels in Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, and Heart Failure, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In January 2021, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services expanded reimbursement coverage eligibility for MitraClip ® , Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR), a leaky heart valve. The growth in Structural Heart during 2021 was broad-based across several areas of the business, including MitraClip and TriClip ® , the world’s first minimally invasive, clip-based device for repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve which was launched in Europe in May 2020. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non-strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbott’s revenue recognition policies as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were not significant in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. There are no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to materially affect Abbott. 30 Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 52.2 percent of net sales in 2021, 50.5 percent in 2020 and 52.5 percent in 2019. In 2021, the increase primarily reflects the effects of higher sales volume, higher manufacturing utilization, and the nonrecurrence of the 2020 impairment of intangible assets, partially offset by increases in various manufacturing costs and the impact of higher restructuring charges. In 2020, the decrease primarily reflects the mix of sales across Abbott’s various businesses and operational inefficiencies due to the impact of COVID-19, as well as the increase in intangible asset amortization, the impairment of intangible assets and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on gross margin. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $2.7 billion in 2021, and $2.4 billion in both 2020 and 2019. The increase in 2021 R&D spending was primarily driven by higher spending on various projects to advance products in development. R&D spending in 2020 was relatively flat compared to 2019 as the impact of the immediate expensing in 2019 of an R&D asset valued at $102 million that was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc. was partially offset by the $55 million impairment of an in-process R&D intangible asset in 2020. R&D expense in 2020 also reflects lower integration and restructuring costs in 2020 related to R&D, partially offset by higher spending on various projects. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 16.8 percent in 2021 due primarily to higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses and the nonrecurrence of $100 million of income in 2020 from a litigation settlement. The increase in 2021 also includes charges related to certain litigation. SG&A expenses were basically flat in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2020, the favorable effect of foreign exchange, income of approximately $100 million from a litigation settlement in 2020, lower spending due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, and the impact of various cost saving initiatives were offset by higher spending to drive growth in various businesses. Restructurings On May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter included fixed asset write-downs of $80 million, inventory-related charges of $248 million, and other exit costs, which included contract cancellations and employee-related costs of $171 million. In the second half of 2021, as the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 spread and the number of new COVID-19 cases increased significantly, particularly in the U.S., demand for rapid COVID-19 tests increased significantly. As a result, in the second half of 2021, Abbott sold approximately $181 million of inventory that was previously estimated to have no net realizable value under the second quarter restructuring action. In addition, the estimate of other exit costs was reduced by a net $58 million as Abbott fulfilled its purchase obligations under certain contracts for which a liability was recorded in the second quarter or Abbott settled with the counterparty in the second half of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $23 million and primarily represent severance obligations. From 2017 to 2021, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2018, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $41 million. From 2019 to 2021, Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges totaling approximately $95 million, comprised of $10 million in 2021, $13 million in 2020, and $72 million in 2019. Approximately $31 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $5 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $59 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense over the last three years. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $9 million. From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. As of December 31, 2018, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $70 million. From 2019 to 2020, Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges totaling approximately $102 million, comprised of $36 million in 2020 and $66 million in 2019. Approximately $22 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $30 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $50 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense over the two years. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $24 million. 31 In 2021, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the diagnostics, established pharmaceuticals and nutritional businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $68 million. Approximately $16 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $4 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $48 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $61 million and primarily represent severance obligations. Interest Expense and Interest (Income) Interest expense, net decreased $10 million in 2021 due to the reduction of interest expense driven by lower interest rates in 2021. The effects of higher cash and short-term investment balances were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates on interest income in 2021. In 2020, interest expense, net decreased $76 million due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in November 2019, the repayment of debt in December 2019 and a lower interest rate environment in 2020. Debt Extinguishment Costs On December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.9% Notes due 2021. Abbott incurred a charge of $63 million related to the early repayment of this debt. Other (Income) Expense, net Other (income) expense, net includes income of approximately $270 million, $205 million and $225 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. Other (income) expense, net also includes a gain on the sale of an equity method investment in 2021 and equity investment impairments that totaled approximately $115 million in 2020. Taxes on Earnings The income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 13.9 percent in 2021, 10.0 percent in 2020, and 9.6 percent in 2019. In 2021, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $145 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and approximately $55 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, and approximately $100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $26 million increase to the transition tax liability associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The $26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.53 billion. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining balance of Abbott’s transition tax obligation is approximately $794 million, which will be paid over the next five years as allowed by the TCJA. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2020 reflect the recognition of $24 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included approximately $100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, an $86 million reduction of the transition tax and $68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India. The $86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2019. Exclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore, and Malta. Abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules, tax rulings, grants, and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate. Research and Development Programs Abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development. 32 Research and Development Process In the Established Pharmaceuticals segment, the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment’s existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. As Established Pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity. Depending upon the product, the phases of development may include: The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to six or more years for complex formulations, new indications, or geographic expansion in specific countries, such as China. In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include: The regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions. In the U.S., the FDA classifies diagnostic products into classes (I, II, or III) and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval. While the Diagnostics segment has products in all three classes, the vast majority of its products are categorized as Class I or Class II. Submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for Class I products. Class II devices typically require pre-market notification to the FDA through a regulatory filing known as a 510(k) submission. Most Class III products are subject to the FDA’s Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. Other Class III products, such as those used to screen blood, require the submission and approval of a Biological License Application (BLA). In the European Union (EU), diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process, which has been governed by the European In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive, depends upon the category, with certain product categories requiring review and approval by an independent company, known as a Notified Body, before the manufacturer can affix a CE mark to the product to declare conformity to the Directive. Other products only require a self-certification process. In 2017, the EU adopted the new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) which replaces the existing directive in the EU for in vitro diagnostic products and imposes additional premarket and post-market regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. In December 2021, the IVDR was amended to extend the regulation’s previous two-year transition period by one to three years, with the transition period extending to May 2027 for certain devices. However, the amendment does not delay the date of application of the IVDR itself which will take effect on May 26, 2022. In the Medical Devices segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product’s safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications. Similar to the diagnostic products discussed above, in the U.S., medical devices are classified as Class I, II, or III. Most of Abbott’s medical device products are classified as Class II devices that follow the 510(k) regulatory process or Class III devices that are subject to the PMA process. 33 In the EU, medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which had been governed by the European Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, varies by class. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) which replaced the existing directives in the EU for medical devices and imposes additional premarket and post-market regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. The MDR applies to manufacturers as of May 26, 2021 after a four-year transition period. Each product must bear a CE mark to show compliance with the MDR. Some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to CE marking of the device. For other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self-certify its ability to apply the CE mark to the product. Outside the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions. After approval and commercial launch of some medical devices, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority. In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product’s efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. In the U.S., the FDA requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products. Prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the FDA’s confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. For other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products. Areas of Focus In 2022 and beyond, Abbott’s significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following: Established Pharmaceuticals — Abbott focuses on building country-specific portfolios made up of high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. Over the next several years, Abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of being among the first to launch new off-patent and differentiated medicines. In addition, Abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. Abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as Creon™, Duphaston™, Duphalac™ and Influvac™. Depending on the product, the activities focus on development of new data, markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications. Medical Devices — Abbott’s research and development programs focus on: 34 Nutritionals — Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastro intestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years. Core Laboratory Diagnostics — Abbott continues to commercialize its next-generation blood and plasma screening, immunoassay, clinical chemistry and hematology systems, along with assays, including a focus on unmet medical need, in various areas including infectious disease, cardiac care, metabolics, and oncology, as well as informatics solutions to help optimize diagnostics laboratory performance and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories. Molecular Diagnostics — Several new molecular in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests are in various stages of development and launch. Rapid Diagnostics — Abbott’s research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for infectious disease, cardiometabolic disease and toxicology. In addition, the Diagnostics segment is pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory process for various COVID-19 tests for which EUAs were obtained. Given the diversity of Abbott’s business, its intention to remain a broad-based health care company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott’s total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott’s overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott’s 2021 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations. While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott’s ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device, diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is targeted at approximately 7 percent of total Abbott sales in 2022. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period. Goodwill At December 31, 2021, goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled $23.2 billion. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs, using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. The results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities amounted to $10.5 billion, $7.9 billion and $6.1 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in Net cash from operating activities in 2021 was primarily due to the favorable cash flow impact of higher segment operating earnings and improved working capital management partially offset by higher cash taxes paid and the net impact of litigation settlements. The increase in Net cash from operating activities in 2020 was primarily due to the favorable cash flow impact of higher segment operating earnings, lower payments related to interest, integration expenses, and restructuring actions, and the proceeds from a litigation settlement partially offset by an increased investment in working capital and higher income tax payments. A substantial portion of Abbott’s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021, is held by Abbott affiliates outside of the U.S. If these funds were needed for operations in the U.S., Abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds. Abbott funded $418 million in 2021, $400 million in 2020 and $382 million in 2019 to defined benefit pension plans. Abbott expects pension funding of approximately $415 million in 2022 for its pension plans. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbott’s capital expenditures and cash dividends. 35 Debt and Capital At December 31, 2021, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was A+ by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A2 by Moody’s. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. The lines of credit are part of a Five Year Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) that Abbott entered into on November 12, 2020. At that time, Abbott also terminated its 2018 revolving credit agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2018 revolving credit agreement at the time of its termination. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on November 12, 2025. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest, at Abbott’s option, based on either a base rate or Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings. In 2021, Abbott repaid approximately $195 million on a short-term facility upon maturity. After the repayment, Abbott has no short-term debt, and as of December 31, 2021, Abbott’s total debt is $18.1 billion. In 2020, financing activities related to the issuance and repayment of long-term debt included the following: In 2019, Abbott committed to reducing its debt levels which had increased as part of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere in 2017. On February 24, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $500 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.80% Notes due 2020. In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. This bond redemption authorization superseded the board’s previous authorization under which $700 million had not yet been redeemed. On December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion outstanding principal amount of its 2.90% Notes due 2021. Of the $5 billion authorization, $2.15 billion remains available as of December 31, 2021. On November 19, 2019, Abbott’s wholly owned subsidiary, Abbott Ireland Financing DAC, completed a euro debt offering of €1.180 billion of long-term debt. The proceeds equated to approximately $1.3 billion. The Notes are guaranteed by Abbott. On November 21, 2019, Abbott borrowed ¥59.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The term loan bears interest at TIBOR plus a fixed spread, and the interest rate is reset quarterly. The proceeds equated to approximately $550 million. In total, these 2019 transactions resulted in the repayment of approximately of $1.6 billion of debt, net of borrowings. In September 2014, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. Under the program authorized in 2014, Abbott repurchased 48.5 million shares at a cost of $2.205 billion from 2015 through 2018, 6.3 million shares at a cost of $525 million in 2019 and 1.6 million shares at a cost of $173 million in 2020 for a total of approximately $2.9 billion. In October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. In 2021, Abbott repurchased 16.6 million of its common shares for $2.016 billion which fully utilized the authorization remaining under the 2014 share repurchase program and a portion of the 2019 authorization. In December 2021, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. The new authorization is in addition to the $1.081 billion unused portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2019. Abbott declared dividends of $1.82 per share in 2021 compared to $1.53 per share in 2020, an increase of approximately 19 percent. Dividends paid were $3.202 billion in 2021 compared to $2.560 billion in 2020. The year-over-year change in dividends paid primarily reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate. 36 Working Capital Working capital was $11.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was due in large part to the higher level of cash and cash equivalents, which was due primarily to the increase in cash generated from operating activities, partially offset by the classification of $750 million of Senior Notes due 2022 as current liabilities at December 31, 2021 and an increase in accounts payable associated with the growth of the business. Abbott monitors the credit worthiness of customers and establishes an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.9 billion in 2021, $2.2 billion in 2020 and $1.6 billion in 2019 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers. The 2020 increase in capital expenditures primarily reflects the building of capacity for the manufacture of COVID-19 diagnostics tests. Contractual Obligations Abbott believes that its available cash and cash equivalents along with its ability to generate operating cash flow and continued access to debt markets are sufficient to fund existing and planned cash requirements. Abbott's material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: Debt — Principal payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 are $754 million in 2022, $2.3 billion in 2023, $1.2 billion in 2024, $1.5 billion in 2025, $3.0 billion in 2026 and $9.3 billion in 2027 and thereafter. Interest payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 are $579 million in 2022, $569 million in 2023, $526 million in 2024, $494 million in 2025, $463 million in 2026 and $5.8 billion in 2027 and thereafter. Operating leases — As of December 31, 2021, estimated contractual obligations for operating lease payments were $1.351 billion, with $272 million due within 12 months. In addition, Abbott enters into purchase commitments in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements. The majority of outstanding purchase commitments generally do not extend past one year. Contingent Obligations Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. Legislative Issues Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. 37 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses , which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments and Risk Management Market Price Sensitive Investments The fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $11 million and $20 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2021 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $391 million and $366 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments, as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings. Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $90 million and $113 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $15 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $2.9 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $21.2 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.4% and 3.3% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively) with maturities through 2046. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values. Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Abbott held $8.6 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2021 will mature in 2022 or 2023 depending upon the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2020 matured in 2021 or will mature in 2022 depending upon the contract. 38 Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Abbott held $12.2 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next 13 months. In November 2019, Abbott borrowed ¥59.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The proceeds equated to approximately $550 million. The value of this long-term debt was approximately $521 million and $577 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 ​ 2020 ​ ​ ​ Weighted Fair and ​ ​ Weighted Fair and ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ Carrying Value ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ Carrying Value ​ ​ Contract ​ Exchange ​ Receivable/ ​ Contract ​ Exchange ​ Receivable/ (dollars in millions) ​ Amount ​ Rate ​ (Payable) ​ Amount ​ Rate ​ (Payable) Primarily U.S. dollars to be exchanged for the following currencies: ​ ​ ​ ​ Euro ​ $ 8,698 1.1360 ​ $ 90 ​ $ 7,781 1.1821 ​ $ (91) Chinese Yuan ​ 2,148 6.5744 ​ (35) ​ 2,401 6.4900 ​ (99) Japanese Yen ​ 1,497 111.7260 ​ 31 ​ 1,589 105.3861 ​ (20) All other currencies ​ 8,426 n/a ​ 109 ​ 7,369 n/a ​ (198) Total ​ $ 20,769 ​ ​ $ 195 ​ $ 19,140 ​ $ (408) ​ ​ ​ 39 ITEM 8.

Financial Statements Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies NATURE OF BUSINESS — Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. USE OF ESTIMATES — The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for sales rebates, income taxes, pension and other post-employment benefits, valuation of intangible assets, litigation, derivative financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION — The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. REVENUE RECOGNITION — Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Revenue from the launch of a new product, from an improved version of an existing product, or for shipments in excess of a customer’s normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve for such revenue, if necessary. In certain of Abbott’s businesses, primarily within diagnostics, Abbott participates in selling arrangements that include multiple performance obligations (e.g., instruments, reagents, procedures, and service agreements). The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Sales of product rights for marketable products are recorded as revenue upon disposition of the rights. INCOME TAXES — Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when the taxes are paid. No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, the TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Abbott treats the GILTI tax as a period expense and provides for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings. EARNINGS PER SHARE — Unvested restricted stock units and awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $ 7.042 billion, $ 4.449 billion and $ 3.666 billion, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $ 7.042 billion, $ 4.473 billion and $ 3.666 billion, respectively. PENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS — Abbott accrues for the actuarially determined cost of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a five-year period. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. ​ 47 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS — For assets and liabilities that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs are valued by reference to similar assets or liabilities, adjusted for contract restrictions and other terms specific to that asset or liability. For these items, a significant portion of fair value is derived by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets. For all remaining assets and liabilities, fair value is derived using a fair value model, such as a discounted cash flow model or Black-Scholes model. Purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value. The fair value of significant purchased intangible assets is based on independent appraisals. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION — The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards and units are amortized over their requisite service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible, with a charge to compensation expense. LITIGATION — Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. Legal fees are recorded as incurred. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS — Cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits, U.S. government securities, money market funds and U.S. treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less. Abbott holds certain investments with a carrying value of $ 256 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments held in a rabbi trust and investments in publicly traded equity securities are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. Investments in equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. TRADE RECEIVABLE VALUATIONS — Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. Accounts receivable are charged off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted. INVENTORIES — Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost includes material and conversion costs. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT — Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table shows estimated useful lives of property and equipment: ​ ​ ​ ​ Classification Estimated Useful Lives Buildings 10 to 50 years Equipment 2 to 20 years ​ PRODUCT LIABILITY — Abbott accrues for product liability claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The liabilities are adjusted quarterly as additional information becomes available. Product liability losses are self-insured. ​ 48 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS — Internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) — The initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completed and are then amortized over the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant. CONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES — Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. Product warranties are not significant. Abbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. ​ ​ ​ Note 2 — New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses , which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ Note 3 — Revenue Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. 49 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) The following tables provide detail by sales category: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 ​ 2020 ​ 2019 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ ​ $ — ​ $ 3,539 ​ $ 3,539 ​ $ — ​ $ 3,209 ​ $ 3,209 ​ $ — ​ $ 3,392 ​ $ 3,392 Other ​ ​ — ​ 1,179 ​ 1,179 ​ — ​ 1,094 ​ 1,094 ​ ​ — ​ 1,094 ​ 1,094 Total ​ ​ — ​ 4,718 ​ 4,718 ​ — ​ 4,303 ​ 4,303 ​ ​ — ​ 4,486 ​ 4,486 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ ​ 2,192 ​ 2,106 ​ 4,298 ​ 1,987 ​ 2,140 ​ 4,127 ​ ​ 1,879 ​ 2,282 ​ 4,161 Adult Nutritionals ​ ​ 1,364 ​ 2,632 ​ 3,996 ​ 1,292 ​ 2,228 ​ 3,520 ​ ​ 1,231 ​ 2,017 ​ 3,248 Total ​ ​ 3,556 ​ 4,738 ​ 8,294 ​ 3,279 ​ 4,368 ​ 7,647 ​ ​ 3,110 ​ 4,299 ​ 7,409 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ ​ 1,145 ​ 3,983 ​ 5,128 ​ 1,166 ​ 3,309 ​ 4,475 ​ ​ 1,086 ​ 3,570 ​ 4,656 Molecular ​ ​ 566 ​ 861 ​ 1,427 ​ 621 ​ 817 ​ 1,438 ​ ​ 149 ​ 293 ​ 442 Point of Care ​ ​ 384 ​ 152 ​ 536 ​ 369 ​ 147 ​ 516 ​ ​ 438 ​ 123 ​ 561 Rapid Diagnostics ​ ​ 5,034 ​ 3,519 ​ 8,553 ​ 2,618 ​ 1,758 ​ 4,376 ​ ​ 1,214 ​ 840 ​ 2,054 Total ​ ​ 7,129 ​ 8,515 ​ 15,644 ​ 4,774 ​ 6,031 ​ 10,805 ​ ​ 2,887 ​ 4,826 ​ 7,713 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ ​ 1,018 ​ 1,180 ​ 2,198 ​ 903 ​ 1,011 ​ 1,914 ​ ​ 1,057 ​ 1,087 ​ 2,144 Electrophysiology ​ ​ 778 ​ 1,129 ​ 1,907 ​ 660 ​ 918 ​ 1,578 ​ ​ 742 ​ 979 ​ 1,721 Heart Failure ​ ​ 654 ​ 235 ​ 889 ​ 547 ​ 193 ​ 740 ​ ​ 574 ​ 195 ​ 769 Vascular ​ ​ 915 ​ 1,739 ​ 2,654 ​ 853 ​ 1,486 ​ 2,339 ​ ​ 1,047 ​ 1,803 ​ 2,850 Structural Heart ​ ​ 730 ​ 880 ​ 1,610 ​ 540 ​ 707 ​ 1,247 ​ ​ 616 ​ 784 ​ 1,400 Neuromodulation ​ ​ 616 ​ 165 ​ 781 ​ 564 ​ 138 ​ 702 ​ ​ 660 ​ 171 ​ 831 Diabetes Care ​ ​ ​ 1,212 ​ ​ 3,116 ​ ​ 4,328 ​ ​ 864 ​ ​ 2,403 ​ ​ 3,267 ​ ​ 678 ​ ​ 1,846 ​ ​ 2,524 Total ​ ​ 5,923 ​ 8,444 ​ 14,367 ​ 4,931 ​ 6,856 ​ 11,787 ​ ​ 5,374 ​ 6,865 ​ 12,239 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ ​ 34 ​ 18 ​ 52 ​ 38 ​ 28 ​ 66 ​ ​ 27 ​ 30 ​ 57 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ ​ $ 16,642 ​ $ 26,433 ​ $ 43,075 ​ $ 13,022 ​ $ 21,586 ​ $ 34,608 ​ $ 11,398 ​ $ 20,506 ​ $ 31,904 ​ Abbott recognizes revenue from product sales upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. For maintenance agreements that provide service beyond Abbott’s standard warranty and other service agreements, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. A time-based measure of progress appropriately reflects the transfer of services to the customer. Payment terms between Abbott and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant. Management exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Abbott provides rebates to government agencies, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other private entities. 50 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Other allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott’s historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant. Abbott also applies judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts that include multiple performance obligations. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. For goods or services for which observable standalone selling prices are not available, Abbott uses an expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2021, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 4 billion in the Diagnostic Products segment and approximately $ 435 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months , approximately 16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in ASC 606-10-50 -14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. Assets Recognized for Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer Abbott has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and records as an expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers in the period of occurrence when the amortization period of the asset that Abbott otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Upfront commission fees paid to sales personnel as a result of obtaining or renewing contracts with customers are incremental to obtaining the contract. Abbott capitalizes these amounts as contract costs. Capitalized commission fees are amortized based on the contract duration to which the assets relate which ranges from two to ten years . The amounts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were not significant. Additionally, the cost of transmitters provided to customers that use Abbott’s remote monitoring service with respect to certain medical devices are capitalized as contract costs. Capitalized transmitter costs are amortized based on the timing of the transfer of services to which the assets relate, which typically ranges from eight to ten years . The amounts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were not significant. Other Contract Assets and Liabilities Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. ​ 51 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Contract Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 294 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ 505 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ( 394 ) Balance at December 31, 2020 ​ ​ 405 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ ​ 615 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ​ ( 500 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 ​ $ 520 ​ ​ Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information Other (income) expense, net, for 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes approximately $ 270 million, $ 205 million and $ 225 million of income, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. The following summarizes the activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 228 Impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 ​ ​ 7 Provisions/charges to income ​ 88 Amounts charged off and other deductions ​ ( 35 ) Balance at December 31, 2020 ​ ​ 288 Provisions/charges to income ​ ​ 51 Amounts charged off and other deductions ​ ​ ( 26 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 ​ $ 313 ​ The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. The detail of various balance sheet components is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 Long-term Investments: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 748 ​ $ 776 Other ​ 68 ​ 45 Total ​ $ 816 ​ $ 821 ​ The decrease in Abbott’s long-term investments as of December 31, 2021 versus the balance as of December 31, 2020 primarily relates to the sale of an equity method investment partially offset by the acquisition of additional investments. ​ 52 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) Abbott’s equity securities as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, include $ 391 million and $ 366 million, respectively, of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. Abbott also holds certain investments as of December 31, 2021 with a carrying value of $ 256 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of $ 90 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. An approximately $ 60 million impairment of an investment was recorded in 2020 for which Abbott had previously recorded an unrealized gain of approximately $ 50 million in 2018. In September 2021, Abbott acquired 100 percent of Walk Vascular, LLC (Walk Vascular), a commercial-stage medical device company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system designed to remove peripheral blood clots. Walk Vascular’s peripheral thrombectomy system will be incorporated into Abbott’s existing endovascular portfolio. The purchase price, the allocation of acquired assets and liabilities, and the revenue and net income contributed by Walk Vascular since the date of acquisition are not material to Abbott’s consolidated financial statements. In 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc., Abbott acquired a research & development (R&D) asset valued at $ 102 million, which was immediately expensed. The $ 102 million of expense was recorded in the Research and development line of Abbott’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 Other Accrued Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Accrued rebates payable to government agencies ​ $ 364 ​ $ 316 Accrued other rebates (a) ​ 1,082 ​ 805 All other ​ 3,735 ​ 4,044 Total ​ $ 5,181 ​ $ 5,165 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 Post-employment Obligations and Other Long-term Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical and dental plans for significant plans ​ $ 2,738 ​ $ 3,119 Deferred income taxes ​ 1,392 ​ 1,406 Operating lease liabilities ​ ​ 956 ​ ​ 902 All other (b) ​ 3,685 ​ 3,684 Total ​ $ 8,771 ​ $ 9,111 ​ 53 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The components of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income taxes, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gains (Losses) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative ​ Net Actuarial ​ on Derivative ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreign ​ (Losses) and ​ Instruments ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Currency ​ Prior Service ​ Designated as ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Translation ​ (Costs) and ​ Cash Flow ​ ​ ​ (in millions) Adjustments Credits Hedges Total Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ ( 4,924 ) ​ $ ( 3,540 ) ​ $ ( 1 ) ​ $ ( 8,465 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ​ 65 ​ ( 523 ) ​ ( 140 ) ​ ( 598 ) (Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (a) ​ ​ — ​ 192 ​ ( 75 ) ​ 117 Net current period other comprehensive income (loss) ​ ​ 65 ​ ( 331 ) ​ ( 215 ) ​ ( 481 ) Balance at December 31, 2020 ​ ​ ( 4,859 ) ​ ​ ( 3,871 ) ​ ​ ( 216 ) ​ ​ ( 8,946 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ​ ( 980 ) ​ 954 ​ 137 ​ 111 (Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (a) ​ ​ — ​ 247 ​ 214 ​ 461 Net current period other comprehensive income (loss) ​ ​ ( 980 ) ​ ​ 1,201 ​ ​ 351 ​ ​ 572 Balance at December 31, 2021 ​ $ ( 5,839 ) ​ $ ( 2,670 ) ​ $ 135 ​ $ ( 8,374 ) Note 6 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 23.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and $ 23.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by $ 532 million in 2021 and increased goodwill by $ 550 million in 2020. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at December 31, 2021 was $ 2.8 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.7 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.4 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There were no reductions of goodwill relating to impairments in 2021 and 2020. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&D acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 919 million and $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease is due to IPR&D assets primarily related to the Medical Devices segment that became amortizable in 2021, partially offset by an increase of approximately $ 80 million related to a recent acquisition. In 2020, a $ 55 million impairment of an IPR&D intangible asset related to the Medical Devices segment was recorded in the Research and development line of Abbott’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $ 27.7 billion and $ 27.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $ 15.9 billion and $ 14.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortizable intangible assets increased by approximately $ 120 million as a result of a recent acquisition and the additional assets are being amortized over 9 years . Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $ 197 million in 2021 and increased intangible assets by $ 67 million in 2020. In 2021, asset impairments related to the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment decreased intangible assets by $ 14 million. In 2020, asset impairments related to the Medical Devices segment decreased intangible assets by $ 148 million. The impairments were recorded in the Cost of products sold, excluding amortization of intangible assets line of Abbott’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2021 is approximately $ 2.1 billion in 2022, $ 2.0 billion in 2023, $ 1.9 billion in 2024, $ 1.7 billion in 2025 and $ 1.6 billion in 2026. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over 2 to 20 years . 54 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7 — Restructuring Plans On May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $ 499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter included fixed asset write-downs of $ 80 million, inventory-related charges of $ 248 million, and other exit costs, which included contract cancellations and employee-related costs of $ 171 million. In the second half of 2021, as the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 spread and the number of new COVID-19 cases increased significantly, particularly in the U.S., demand for rapid COVID-19 tests increased significantly. As a result, in the second half of 2021, Abbott sold approximately $ 181 million of inventory that was previously estimated to have no net realizable value under the second quarter restructuring action. In addition, the estimate of other exit costs was reduced by a net $ 58 million as Abbott fulfilled its purchase obligations under certain contracts for which a liability was recorded in the second quarter or Abbott settled with the counterparty in the second half of 2021. The following summarizes the activity related to this restructuring action and the status of the related accruals as of December 31, 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Inventory- ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Related ​ Fixed Asset ​ Other Exit ​ ​ ​ (in millions) Charges Write-Downs Costs Total Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 ​ $ 248 ​ $ 80 ​ $ 113 ​ $ 441 Payments ​ — ​ — ​ ( 90 ) ​ ( 90 ) Other non-cash ​ ( 248 ) ​ ( 80 ) ​ — ​ ( 328 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2021 ​ $ — ​ $ — ​ $ 23 ​ $ 23 ​ From 2017 to 2021, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2018, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $ 41 million. From 2019 to 2021, Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges totaling approximately $ 95 million, comprised of $ 10 million in 2021, $ 13 million in 2020, and $ 72 million in 2019. Approximately $ 31 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 5 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $ 59 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense over the last three years. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $ 9 million. From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. As of December 31, 2018, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $ 70 million. From 2019 to 2020, Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges totaling approximately $ 102 million, comprised of $ 36 million in 2020 and $ 66 million in 2019. Approximately $ 22 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 30 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $ 50 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense over the two years. As of December 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $ 24 million. In 2021, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the diagnostics, established pharmaceuticals, nutritional, and medical devices businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $ 68 million. Approximately $ 16 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 4 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $ 48 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. 55 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7 — Restructuring Plans (Continued) The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Restructuring charges in 2021 ​ $ 68 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 7 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2021 ​ $ 61 ​ ​ Note 8 — Incentive Stock Program The 2017 Incentive Stock Program authorizes the granting of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards, foreign benefits and other share-based awards. Stock options and restricted stock awards and units comprise the majority of benefits that have been granted and are currently outstanding under this program and a prior program. In 2021, Abbott granted 2,865,115 stock options, 497,373 restricted stock awards and 4,721,696 restricted stock units under this program. Under Abbott’s stock incentive programs, the purchase price of shares under option must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the maximum term of an option is 10 years . Options generally vest equally over three years . Restricted stock awards generally vest over three years , with no more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year upon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target. Restricted stock units vest over three years and upon vesting, the recipient receives one share of Abbott stock for each vested restricted stock unit. The aggregate fair market value of options and restricted stock awards and units is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which may be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant. Restricted stock awards and settlement of vested restricted stock units are issued out of treasury shares. Abbott generally issues new shares for exercises of stock options. As a policy, Abbott does not purchase its shares relating to its share-based programs. In April 2017, Abbott’s shareholders authorized the 2017 Incentive Stock Program under which a maximum of 170 million shares were available for issuance. At December 31, 2021, approximately 102 million shares remained available for future issuance. The following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2021. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ Average ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ Remaining ​ Aggregate (intrinsic values in millions) Options Exercise Price Life (Years) Intrinsic Value Outstanding at December 31, 2020 ​ 28,919,886 ​ $ 55.65 6.0 $ 1,557 Granted 2,865,115 ​ 123.70 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Exercised ( 4,495,454 ) ​ 40.48 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Lapsed ( 89,696 ) ​ 106.80 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding at December 31, 2021 27,199,851 ​ $ 65.16 5.7 $ 2,056 Exercisable at December 31, 2021 ​ 20,387,490 ​ $ 53.49 ​ 4.9 ​ $ 1,779 ​ 56 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 8 — Incentive Stock Program (Continued) The following table summarizes restricted stock awards and units activity for the year ended December 31, 2021. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ ​ ​ Grant-Date ​ ​ Share Units ​ Fair Value Outstanding at December 31, 2020 12,492,868 ​ $ 78.19 Granted 5,219,069 ​ 123.85 Vested ( 6,507,761 ) ​ 73.54 Forfeited ( 645,651 ) ​ 98.13 Outstanding at December 31, 2021 10,558,525 ​ $ 102.40 ​ The fair market value of restricted stock awards and units vested in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 809 million, $ 631 million and $ 588 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 393 million, $ 279 million and $ 315 million, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to all share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2021 amounted to approximately $ 450 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . Total non-cash stock compensation expense charged against income from continuing operations in 2021, 2020 and 2019 for share-based plans totaled approximately $ 640 million, $ 546 million and $ 519 million, respectively, and the tax benefit recognized was approximately $ 267 million, $ 200 million and $ 197 million, respectively. Stock compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory is not significant.

Dividend yield is based on the option’s exercise price and annual dividend rate at the time of grant. 57 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit The following is a summary of long-term debt at December 31: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 2.55 % Notes, due 2022 ​ $ 750 ​ $ 750 0.875 % Notes, due 2023 ​ ​ 1,294 ​ ​ 1,398 3.40 % Notes, due 2023 ​ ​ 1,050 ​ ​ 1,050 5-year term loan due 2024 ​ ​ 521 ​ ​ 577 0.10 % Notes, due 2024 ​ ​ 670 ​ ​ 724 3.875 % Notes, due 2025 ​ ​ 500 ​ ​ 500 2.95 % Notes, due 2025 ​ ​ 1,000 ​ ​ 1,000 1.50 % Notes, due 2026 ​ ​ 1,294 ​ ​ 1,398 3.75 % Notes, due 2026 ​ ​ 1,700 ​ ​ 1,700 0.375 % Notes, due 2027 ​ ​ 670 ​ ​ 724 1.15 % Notes, due 2028 ​ ​ 650 ​ ​ 650 1.40 % Notes, due 2030 ​ ​ 650 ​ ​ 650 4.75 % Notes, due 2036 ​ ​ 1,650 ​ ​ 1,650 6.15 % Notes, due 2037 ​ 547 ​ 547 6.00 % Notes, due 2039 ​ 515 ​ 515 5.30 % Notes, due 2040 ​ 694 ​ 694 4.75 % Notes, due 2043 ​ 700 ​ 700 4.90 % Notes, due 2046 ​ ​ 3,250 ​ ​ 3,250 Unamortized debt issuance costs ​ ​ ( 78 ) ​ ​ ( 87 ) Other, including fair value adjustments relating to interest rate hedge contracts designated as fair value hedges ​ 23 ​ 144 Total carrying amount of long-term debt ​ 18,050 ​ 18,534 Less: Current portion ​ 754 ​ 7 Total long-term portion ​ $ 17,296 ​ $ 18,527 ​ On June 24, 2020, Abbott completed the issuance of $ 1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $ 650 million of its 1.15 % Notes due 2028 and $ 650 million of its 1.40 % Notes due 2030. On September 28, 2020, Abbott repaid the € 1.140 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.00 % Notes due 2020 upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $ 1.3 billion. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $ 5 billion on an unsecured basis. The lines of credit are part of a Five Year Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) that Abbott entered into on November 12, 2020. At that time, Abbott also terminated its 2018 revolving credit agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2018 revolving credit agreement at the time of its termination. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on November 12, 2025. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest, at Abbott’s option, based on either a base rate or Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings. In 2019, Abbott’s long-term borrowings and debt issuance included the following: 58 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit (Continued) In 2019, Abbott’s repayment of long-term debt included the following: The 2.80 % Notes were redeemed under a bond redemption authorization approved by the board of directors in 2018. The 2.9 % Notes were redeemed under a bond redemption authorization approved by the board of directors in September 2019 for the early redemption of up to $ 5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. The 2019 bond redemption authorization superseded the board’s 2018 authorization. Of the $ 5 billion authorization, $ 2.15 billion remains available as of December 31, 2021. Principal payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 are $ 754 million in 2022, $ 2.3 billion in 2023, $ 1.2 billion in 2024, $ 1.5 billion in 2025, $ 3.0 billion in 2026 and $ 9.3 billion in 2027 and thereafter. At December 31, 2021, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was A+ by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A2 by Moody’s. In December 2021, Abbott repaid a short-term facility for approximately $ 195 million. After the repayment, Abbott has no short-term borrowings. Abbott’s weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings was 0.4 % at December 31, 2020 and 2019. ​ Note 10 — Leases Leases where Abbott is the Lessee Abbott has entered into operating leases as the lessee for office space, manufacturing facilities, R&D laboratories, warehouses, vehicles and equipment. Finance leases are not significant. Abbott’s operating leases generally have remaining lease terms of 1 to 10 years . Some leases include options to extend beyond the original lease term , generally up to 10 years and some include options to terminate early . These options have been included in the determination of the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. For all of its asset classes, Abbott elected the practical expedient allowed under FASB ASC No. 842, “Leases” to account for each lease component (e.g., the right to use office space) and the associated non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services) as a single lease component. Abbott also elected the short-term lease accounting policy for all asset classes; therefore, Abbott is not recognizing a lease liability or right of use (ROU) asset for any lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that Abbott is reasonably certain to exercise. As Abbott’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the interest rate used to determine the present value of the payments under each lease typically reflects Abbott’s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. Abbott’s incremental borrowing rates at January 1, 2019 were used for operating leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019 when ASC No. 842 was adopted. 59 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 10 — Leases (Continued) The following table provides information related to Abbott’s operating leases: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions, except weighted averages) 2021 2020 ​ 2019 ​ Operating lease cost (a) ​ $ 359 ​ $ 329 ​ $ 314 ​ Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities ​ ​ 287 ​ ​ 264 ​ ​ 253 ​ ROU assets arising from entering into new operating lease obligations ​ ​ 343 ​ ​ 396 ​ ​ 310 ​ Weighted average remaining lease term at December 31 (in years) ​ ​ 8 ​ ​ 8 ​ ​ 8 ​ Weighted average discount rate at December 31 ​ ​ 2.7 % ​ 3.2 % ​ 3.9 % Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2021 were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ 2022 ​ $ 272 2023 ​ 234 2024 ​ 178 2025 ​ 142 2026 ​ 118 Thereafter ​ 407 Total future minimum lease payments – undiscounted ​ 1,351 Less: imputed interest ​ ( 150 ) Present value of lease liabilities ​ $ 1,201 ​ The following table summarizes the amounts and location of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Balance Sheet Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Lease - ROU Asset ​ $ 1,153 ​ $ 1,101 ​ Deferred income taxes and other assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Lease Liability: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Current ​ $ 245 ​ $ 241 ​ Other accrued liabilities Non-current ​ 956 ​ ​ 902 ​ Post-employment obligations and other long-term liabilities Total Liability ​ $ 1,201 ​ $ 1,143 ​ ​ ​ 60 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 10 — Leases (Continued) Leases where Abbott is the Lessor Certain assets, primarily diagnostics instruments, are leased to customers under contractual arrangements that typically include an operating or sales-type lease as well as performance obligations for reagents and other consumables. Sales-type leases are not significant. Contract terms vary by customer and may include options to terminate the contract or options to extend the contract. Where instruments are provided under operating lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g., reagent) sales. The allocation of revenue between the lease and non-lease components is based on standalone selling prices. Operating lease revenue represented less than 3 percent of Abbott’s total net sales in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Assets related to operating leases are reported within Net property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $ 3.5 billion and $ 1.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $ 3.3 billion and $ 1.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. ​ Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 8.6 billion at December 31, 2021, and $ 8.1 billion at December 31, 2020, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2021 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Abbott held gross notional amounts of $ 12.2 billion and $ 11.0 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. In November 2019, Abbott borrowed ¥ 59.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The proceeds equated to approximately $ 550 million. The value of this long-term debt was approximately $ 521 million and $ 577 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. 61 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.

These amounts are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line. The interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The hedged debt is marked to market, offsetting the effect of marking the interest rate swaps to market. 62 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of December 31 are shown in the table below. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.

The fair value of the debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. Contingent consideration relates to businesses acquired by Abbott. The increase in contingent consideration during the year primarily reflects the fair value of the contingent consideration that resulted from a recent acquisition; the fair value of such contingent consideration was determined based on an independent appraisal. The maximum amount for certain contingent consideration is not determinable as it is based on a percent of certain sales. Excluding such contingent consideration, the maximum amount that may be due under the other contingent consideration arrangements was estimated at December 31, 2021 to be approximately $ 230 million, which is dependent upon attaining certain sales thresholds or upon the occurrence of certain events, such as regulatory approvals. The increase from the estimate at December 31, 2020 of approximately $ 200 million reflects the additional contingent consideration that resulted from a recent acquisition, partially offset by the expiration of certain contingent consideration arrangements. Note 12 — Litigation and Environmental Matters Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 30 million to $ 45 million. The recorded accrual balance at December 31, 2021 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 40 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ​ 64 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13 — Post-Employment Benefits Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution and medical and dental plans.

The $ 1.3 billion of defined benefit plan losses in 2020 that increased the projected benefit obligations primarily reflect the year-over-year decline in the discount rates used to measure the obligations. The projected benefit obligations for non-U.S. defined benefit plans were $ 3.7 billion and $ 4.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligations for all defined benefit plans were $ 11.5 billion and $ 11.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For plans where the projected benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the projected benefit obligations and the aggregate plan assets were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 Projected benefit obligation ​ $ 2,632 ​ $ 8,946 Fair value of plan assets ​ 1,057 ​ 7,010 ​ 65 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) For plans where the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligations, the projected benefit obligations and the aggregate plan assets were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 Accumulated benefit obligation ​ $ 1,406 ​ $ 2,459 Projected benefit obligation ​ 1,554 ​ 2,773 Fair value of plan assets ​ 136 ​ 965 ​ The components of the net periodic benefit cost were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical and ​ ​ Defined Benefit Plans ​ Dental Plans (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 ​ 2021 2020 2019 Service cost — benefits earned during the year ​ $ 391 ​ $ 336 ​ $ 250 ​ $ 56 ​ $ 46 ​ $ 23 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations ​ 248 ​ 300 ​ 337 ​ 33 ​ 42 ​ 52 Expected return on plans’ assets ​ ( 843 ) ​ ( 770 ) ​ ( 710 ) ​ ( 27 ) ​ ( 28 ) ​ ( 27 ) Amortization of actuarial losses ​ 317 ​ 255 ​ ​ 132 ​ ​ 29 ​ ​ 21 ​ ​ 22 Amortization of prior service cost (credits) ​ ​ 1 ​ ​ 1 ​ ​ 1 ​ ​ ( 28 ) ​ ​ ( 28 ) ​ ​ ( 32 ) Total net cost ​ $ 114 ​ $ 122 ​ $ 10 ​ $ 63 ​ $ 53 ​ $ 38 ​ Other comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year includes the amortization of actuarial losses and prior service costs (credits) as noted in the previous table. Other comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year also includes: net actuarial gains of $ 1.141 billion for defined benefit plans and a gain of $ 45 million for medical and dental plans in 2021; net actuarial losses of $ 611 million for defined benefit plans and a gain of $ 23 million for medical and dental plans in 2020, and net actuarial losses of $ 944 million for defined benefit plans and a loss of $ 190 million for medical and dental plans in 2019. The net actuarial gains in 2021 are primarily due to the favorable impact of actual asset returns in excess of expected returns and the year-over-year increase in discount rates. The net actuarial losses in 2020 are primarily due to the year-over-year decline in discount rates partially offset by the impact of actual asset returns in excess of expected returns. The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 2020 2019 Discount rate 2.7 % 2.3 % 3.0 % Expected aggregate average long-term change in compensation 4.3 % 4.3 % 4.3 % ​ The weighted average assumptions used to determine the net cost for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 2020 2019 Discount rate 2.3 % 3.0 % 4.0 % Expected return on plan assets 7.5 % 7.5 % 7.5 % Expected aggregate average long-term change in compensation 4.3 % 4.3 % 4.3 % ​ The assumed health care cost trend rates for medical and dental plans at December 31 were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 2020 2019 Health care cost trend rate assumed for the next year 7 % 8 % 9 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to 5 % 5 % 5 % Year that rate reaches the assumed ultimate rate 2026 ​ 2025 ​ 2025 ​ ​ 66 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are forward projections of health care costs as of the measurement date.

Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. For approximately half of these funds, investments may be redeemed once per week or month, with a required 2 to 30 day notice period. For the remaining funds, daily redemption of an investment is allowed. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry recognized vendors. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to fixed income funds at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Fixed income securities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. For the majority of these funds, investments may be redeemed either weekly or monthly, with a required 2 to 14 day notice period. For the remaining funds, investments may be generally redeemed daily. Absolute return funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. All private funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund on a one-quarter lag adjusted for known cash flows and significant events through the reporting date. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to absolute return funds at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Investments in these funds may be generally redeemed monthly or quarterly with required notice periods ranging from 5 to 90 days . For approximately $ 290 million and $ 150 million of the absolute return funds, redemptions are subject to a 33 percent gate and a 25 percent gate, respectively, and $ 50 million is subject to a lock until 2022. Investments in the private funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2022 to 2031. Abbott’s unfunded commitment in these funds was $ 585 million and $ 523 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, as well as balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities with lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The plans do not directly hold any securities of Abbott. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plans’ assets. Abbott’s medical and dental plans’ assets are invested in a similar mix as the pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation percentages at year end are consistent with the company’s targeted asset allocation percentages. The plans’ expected return on assets, as shown above is based on management’s expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. Abbott funds its domestic pension plans according to IRS funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. Abbott funded $ 418 million in 2021 and $ 400 million in 2020 to defined pension plans. Abbott expects to contribute approximately $ 415 million to its pension plans in 2022. 68 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which includes payments funded from company assets, as well as paid from the plans, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined ​ Medical and (in millions) Benefit Plans Dental Plans 2022 ​ $ 350 ​ $ 75 2023 ​ ​ 365 ​ ​ 75 2024 ​ ​ 387 ​ ​ 77 2025 ​ ​ 408 ​ ​ 78 2026 ​ ​ 429 ​ ​ 79 2027 to 2031 ​ ​ 2,485 ​ ​ 410 ​ The Abbott Stock Retirement Plan is the principal defined contribution plan. Abbott’s contributions to this plan were $ 181 million in 2021, $ 164 million in 2020 and $ 158 million in 2019. ​ Note 14 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the annual effective rates, including charges for interest and penalties. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. In 2021, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $ 145 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and approximately $ 55 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $ 170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $ 140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, and approximately $ 100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $ 26 million increase to the transition tax liability associated with the 2017 TCJA. The $ 26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $ 1.53 billion. The one-time transition tax is based on Abbott’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 E&P considered held in cash and other specified assets. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining balance of Abbott’s transition tax obligation is approximately $ 794 million, which will be paid over the next five years as allowed by the TCJA. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in 2020 reflect the recognition of $ 24 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included approximately $ 100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, an $ 86 million reduction of the transition tax and $ 68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India. The $ 86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2019. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. There are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which are individually significant. Reserves for interest and penalties are not significant. 69 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued) Earnings from continuing operations before taxes, and the related provisions for taxes on earnings from continuing operations, were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Taxes: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Domestic ​ $ 3,264 ​ $ 1,588 ​ $ 889 Foreign ​ 4,947 ​ 3,380 ​ ​ 3,188 Total ​ $ 8,211 ​ $ 4,968 ​ $ 4,077 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Taxes on Earnings From Continuing Operations: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Current: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Domestic ​ $ 859 ​ $ 39 ​ $ 291 Foreign ​ 790 ​ 566 ​ ​ 590 Total current ​ 1,649 ​ 605 ​ ​ 881 Deferred: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Domestic ​ ( 355 ) ​ ( 18 ) ​ ​ ( 305 ) Foreign ​ ( 154 ) ​ ( 90 ) ​ ​ ( 186 ) Total deferred ​ ( 509 ) ​ ( 108 ) ​ ​ ( 491 ) Total ​ $ 1,140 ​ $ 497 ​ $ 390 ​ Differences between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2021 2020 2019 Statutory tax rate on earnings from continuing operations 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Impact of foreign operations ( 3.9 ) ​ ( 3.3 ) ​ ( 5.0 ) ​ Impact of TCJA and other related items ​ — ​ 0.5 ​ ( 2.1 ) ​ Foreign-derived intangible income benefit ​ ( 1.1 ) ​ ( 1.0 ) ​ ( 2.0 ) ​ Domestic impairment loss ​ ( 0.1 ) ​ ( 2.7 ) ​ — ​ Excess tax benefits related to stock compensation ​ ( 1.7 ) ​ ( 1.9 ) ​ ( 2.5 ) ​ Research tax credit ​ ( 0.6 ) ​ ( 1.0 ) ​ ( 1.2 ) ​ Resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years ( 0.7 ) ​ ( 2.8 ) ​ — ​ Intercompany restructurings and integration ​ 0.1 ​ 0.5 ​ — ​ State taxes, net of federal benefit 0.4 ​ 0.5 ​ 0.8 ​ All other, net 0.5 ​ 0.2 ​ 0.6 ​ Effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations 13.9 % 10.0 % 9.6 % ​ Impact of foreign operations is primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore, and Malta. 70 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued) The tax effect of the differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Compensation and employee benefits $ 618 ​ $ 1,003 Other, primarily reserves not currently deductible, and NOL’s and credit carryforwards ​ ​ 2,425 ​ ​ 2,483 Trade receivable reserves ​ ​ 206 ​ ​ 196 Inventory reserves ​ ​ 169 ​ ​ 146 Lease liabilities ​ ​ 273 ​ ​ 259 Deferred intercompany profit ​ ​ 261 ​ ​ 254 Total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance ​ ​ 3,952 ​ ​ 4,341 Valuation allowance ​ ​ ( 1,180 ) ​ ​ ( 1,160 ) Total deferred tax assets ​ ​ 2,772 ​ ​ 3,181 Deferred tax liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Depreciation ​ ​ ( 330 ) ​ ​ ( 297 ) Right of Use lease assets ​ ​ ( 264 ) ​ ​ ( 251 ) Other, primarily the excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets ​ ​ ( 2,364 ) ​ ​ ( 2,876 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ​ ​ ( 2,958 ) ​ ​ ( 3,424 ) Total net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ ( 186 ) ​ $ ( 243 ) ​ Abbott has incurred losses in a foreign jurisdiction where realization of the future economic benefit is so remote that the benefit is not reflected as a deferred tax asset. The following table summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such unrecognized tax benefits were settled: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 January 1 ​ $ 1,210 ​ $ 1,175 Increase due to current year tax positions ​ 143 ​ ​ 190 Increase due to prior year tax positions ​ 748 ​ ​ 97 Decrease due to prior year tax positions ​ ( 119 ) ​ ​ ( 144 ) Settlements ​ ( 35 ) ​ ​ ( 27 ) Lapse of statute ​ ​ ( 39 ) ​ ​ ( 81 ) December 31 ​ $ 1,908 ​ $ 1,210 ​ The 2021 increase due to prior year tax positions includes approximately $ 714 million of international tax positions for which a deferred tax asset has not been recorded because recognition of the future benefit is not expected. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is approximately $ 1.12 billion. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within a range of $ 50 million to $ 60 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. ​ 71 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15 — Segment and Geographic Area Information Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.

Long-lived asset balances associated with other countries were not material on an individual country basis in either of the two years. ​ ​ ​ 74 ​ Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Abbott Laboratories is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Abbott’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Abbott’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2021, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. Abbott’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 78. Robert B. Ford Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Robert E. Funck, Jr. Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Philip P. Boudreau Vice President, Finance and Controller February 18, 2022 ​ 75 ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders’ investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 76 ​ Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. ​ ​ Income taxes – Unrecognized tax benefits Description of the Matter ​ As described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2021. Unrecognized tax benefits are assessed by management quarterly for identification and measurement, or more frequently if there are any indicators suggesting change in unrecognized tax benefits. Assessing tax positions involves judgement including interpreting tax laws of multiple jurisdictions and assumptions relevant to the measurement of an unrecognized tax benefit, including the estimated amount of tax liability that may be incurred should the tax position not be sustained upon inspection by a tax authority. These judgements and assumptions can significantly affect unrecognized tax benefits. How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit ​ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s identification and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, as well as its process for the assessment of events that may indicate a change in unrecognized tax benefits is warranted. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the completeness of identified unrecognized tax benefits, as well as controls over management’s review of significant assumptions used within the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits. With the support of our tax professionals, among other audit procedures performed, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s judgement with respect to the interpretation of tax laws of multiple jurisdictions by reading and evaluating management’s documentation, including relevant accounting policies, and by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, affected management’s judgments. We tested the completeness of management’s assessment of the identification of unrecognized tax benefits and possible outcomes related to it including evaluation of technical merits of the unrecognized tax benefits. We also tested, with the support of our valuation specialists, appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and significant assumptions associated with the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, including assessing the estimated amount of tax liability that may be incurred should the tax position not be sustained upon inspection by a tax authority. ​ /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. Chicago , Illinois February 18, 2022 ​ 77 ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated February 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 18, 2022 ​ 78 ​ ITEM 9.

Benefits under the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program (the “2009 Program”) include non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, other share-based awards (including stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and recognition awards), awards to non-employee directors, and foreign benefits. The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2009 Program may be issued in connection with any one of these benefits and may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards are satisfied from treasury shares). ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ If there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 2009 Program without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program (the “2017 Program”). If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2009 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2009 Program. ​ ​ ​ 80 ​ ​ ​ In April 2017, the 2009 Program was replaced by the 2017 Program. No further awards will be granted under the 2009 Program. ​ ​ ​ ​ (ii) Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program . Benefits under the 2017 Program include non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, other share-based awards (including stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and recognition awards), awards to non-employee directors, and foreign benefits. The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2017 Program may be issued in connection with any one of these benefits and may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards are satisfied from treasury shares). ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ If there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 2017 Program without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program. If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2017 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program. ​ ​ ​ ​ (iii) Abbott Laboratories Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees . Eligible employees of participating non-U.S. affiliates of Abbott may participate in this plan. An eligible employee may authorize payroll deductions at the rate of 1% to 10% of eligible compensation (in multiples of one percent) subject to a limit of US $12,500 during any purchase cycle. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Purchase cycles are generally six months long and usually begin on August 1 and February 1. On the last day of each purchase cycle, Abbott uses participant contributions to acquire Abbott common shares. The shares may be either authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares acquired on the open market. The purchase price is typically 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date or on the first day of that purchase cycle. As the number of shares subject to outstanding options is indeterminable, columns (a) and (b) of the above table do not include information on the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2021, an aggregate of 10,638,639 common shares were available for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, including shares subject to purchase during the current purchase cycle. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ In April 2017, the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees was amended and restated as the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees. ​ ​ ​ (2) ​ Not included in the table: St. Jude Medical, Inc. Plans . In 2017, in connection with the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc., options outstanding under the St. Jude Medical, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated (2014) were assumed by Abbott and converted into Abbott options of substantially equivalent value. As of December 31, 2021, 589,916 options remained outstanding under these plans. These options have a weighted average purchase price of $30.61.

BUSINESS GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS Abbott Laboratories is an Illinois corporation, incorporated in 1900. Abbott’s* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. Established Pharmaceutical Products These products include a broad line of branded generic pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide and marketed and sold outside the United States in emerging markets. These products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with, or licensed from, other companies. The principal products included in the broad therapeutic area portfolios of the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment are: The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment directs its primary marketing efforts toward building strong brands with key stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Government agencies are also important customers. Competition in the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is generally from other health care and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors may increase competitive pressures. * As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the term “Abbott” refers to Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois corporation, or Abbott Laboratories and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. 1 Diagnostic Products These products include a broad line of diagnostic systems and tests manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, clinics, physicians’ offices, retailers, government agencies, alternate care testing sites, and plasma protein therapeutic companies from Abbott owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors. The principal products included in the Diagnostic Products segment are: The Diagnostic Products segment’s products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, instrument warranty provisions, product performance, laboratory efficiency, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. Nutritional Products These products include a broad line of pediatric and adult nutritional products manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to consumers and to institutions, wholesalers, retailers, health care facilities, government agencies, and third-party distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers or third-party distributors. The principal products included in the Nutritional Products segment are: 2 * These products are available with 2'‐FL HMO (Human Milk Oligosaccharide) in several markets. Primary marketing efforts for nutritional products are directed toward consumers or to securing the recommendation of Abbott’s brand of products by physicians or other health care professionals. In addition, certain nutritional products sold as Similac ® , Gain™, Grow™, Eleva™, PediaSure ® , PediaSure SideKicks ® , Pedialyte ® , Ensure ® , Zone Perfect ® , and Glucerna ® are also promoted directly to the public by consumer marketing efforts in select markets where appropriate. Competition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers’ products may increase competitive pressure. Medical Devices These products include a broad line of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care products for people with diabetes, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally marketed and sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, physicians’ offices, and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. The principal products included in the Medical Devices segment are: 3 These products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, product performance, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ABBOTT’S BUSINESS IN GENERAL Sources and Availability of Raw Materials Abbott purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to Abbott’s operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and around the world. There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies. Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses Abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products. Accordingly, where possible, patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for Abbott’s products in the United States and countries of interest to Abbott. Abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications. Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 through 4. These, and various patents which expire during the period 2021 to 2041, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Abbott’s business. Abbott believes that no single patent, license, or trademark is material in relation to Abbott’s business as a whole. Seasonal Aspects, Customers, and Renegotiation There are no significant seasonal aspects to Abbott’s business. Abbott has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on Abbott. No material portion of Abbott’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government. Environmental Matters Abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. Abbott’s capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2020 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2021. Abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which are owned by Abbott, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, Abbott believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Human Capital The sustainability of Abbott’s business depends on attracting, engaging and developing talented people with diverse backgrounds who share Abbott’s mission to help people live their healthiest possible lives. Abbott provides its employees opportunities to grow and develop their careers, market competitive compensation and benefit programs, and the satisfaction of being part of a global company dedicated to improving health in more than 160 countries. 4 As of December 31, 2020, Abbott employed approximately 109,000 people, 70% of whom were employed outside of the U.S. Women represented 47% of Abbott’s U.S. workforce, 45% of its global workforce, and 39% of its managers. Health and Safety The health, safety and wellness of its employees is an Abbott priority embedded at every level of its business. Abbott’s integrated Environmental, Health and Safety organization governs health, safety and wellness at Abbott’s facilities. Abbott also maintains global policies and standards for managing employee health and safety. Abbott takes a holistic approach to employee well-being. Abbott’s global wellness programs are designed to meet the unique needs of employees across businesses and geographies and offer a wide range of programs, including supporting the mental, financial and physical health of employees and their families. For example, for over 20 years, Abbott has annually offered Exercise Across Abbott, which is a four-week physical wellness program that encourages employees to team up with colleagues and track how many minutes they exercise each day. Over 22,000 Abbott employees across 72 countries took part in 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees, including implementing mandatory temperature screening and social distancing, providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, and at most U.S. facilities, onsite COVID-19 testing. Talent Management Abbott has an integrated global talent management process that is designed to identify and assess talent across the organization and provide equal and consistent opportunities for employees to develop their skills. All levels of employees participate in Abbott’s annual performance management process to create development plans that support their particular career objectives, and Abbott provides a broad range of training, mentoring and other development opportunities to help its employees meet these objectives. The board of directors conducts an annual Talent Management Review, focusing on development of talent, diversity, and succession planning for critical positions. Similar reviews take place at every level of Abbott to develop talent and diversity across the organization. Diversity and Inclusion Abbott is committed to developing a workplace that is inclusive for all. Abbott ties executive compensation to human capital management, including diversity outcomes, to sustain an inclusive culture and the fair and balanced treatment of Abbott’s employees. Abbott’s employee networks play an important role in building an inclusive culture across all Abbott operations. A member of Abbott’s senior management serves as a sponsor for each of these networks, helping to align their objectives with Abbott’s business strategies. Abbott has ten such networks, which are: Advancing Professionals Network (supporting early career employees), Asian Leadership and Cultural Network, Black Business Network, Flex Network (employees with part-time and flexible schedules), LA VOICE Network (supporting Hispanic and Latino employees), People with Disabilities Network, PRIDE (supporting LGBTQ employees), Veterans Network, Women Leaders of Abbott, and Women in STEM. Abbott offers professional development programs, which provide recent college graduates the opportunity to rotate through different areas of Abbott, often with the chance to work outside their home country. In 2020, 52% of the participants were women. Also, Abbott hosts hundreds of college students for paid internships. In 2020, 55% of the U.S. interns were women and 39% were minorities. Further, Abbott has operated a STEM internship program for high school students in the U.S. since 2012. The program’s objective is to increase the number of students pursuing STEM-related careers and contribute to a more diverse talent pipeline for Abbott. In 2020, 58% of the STEM interns were women and 71% were minorities. 5 Compensation and Benefits Abbott is committed to building, retaining, and motivating a diverse talent pipeline that can meet the current and future needs of its businesses. To that end, Abbott provides market competitive compensation, healthcare benefits, pension and/or retirement savings plans, and several programs to facilitate employees building an ownership stake in Abbott, including a global long-term incentive program for employees generally beginning at the manager level. Abbott also has procedures and processes focused on providing employees equitable compensation, regardless of race or gender or other personal characteristics. Regulation The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott’s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar international regulatory agencies. Government regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott’s products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott’s clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many pandemic-related products (including diagnostic tests) were authorized by regulators for emergency use solely during the pandemic. In addition, many governments enacted policies to expedite or promote access to health care in order to slow or stop the spread of the virus. Examples include expansion of telehealth coverages and increased reimbursements for diagnostic testing. It is uncertain when the public health emergency will end and to what extent these policies will continue or revert back to previous policies. Abbott’s international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott’s investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products. Abbott’s laboratory facilities and home monitoring services, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to third-party payors. In the United States, Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria. Abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott’s business. Among other effects, health care regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Device Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions, including suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory’s certification, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties. 6 Abbott’s business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in many countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. Abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products. Many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, or coverage limitations. Budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on Abbott’s products for the foreseeable future. In the United States, the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices, diagnostics, supplies, and other products, as well as the procedures in which these products may be used. The government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home, and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time. For example, Medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment (including diabetes products), enteral nutrition products, and supplies. Additionally, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act established a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests in 2018. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. In October 2018, the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required, beginning with reports filed in 2022. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. Policy changes or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to health care systems. In the United States, this could include potential modification, including expansion or repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act. The regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information (including patient health information, financial information and other sensitive personal information), is increasing. For example, the European Union, various other countries, and various U.S. states (e.g., California) have enacted stricter data protection laws that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information, and the FDA has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices. In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering “data localization” laws, which limit companies’ ability to transfer protected data across country borders. Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties. Transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended, and Abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area. Governmental cost containment efforts also affect Abbott’s nutritional products business. In the United States, for example, under regulations governing the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula. As a result, through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program. 7 Abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture, quality assurance requirements, marketing authorization processes, post-market surveillance requirements, availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services, as well as data privacy and security. Abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing health care products or services to market, access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical, nutrition, diagnostic, and medical device industries, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above.

These reports and other information are also available, free of charge, at www.sec.gov. Abbott’s corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of Abbott’s audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy committee are all available on Abbott’s investor relations website ( www.abbottinvestor.com ). ​ 8 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott’s securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott’s actual results. Abbott’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Business and Operational Risks Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott’s credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity. Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s results of operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties. Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties. Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Similarly, there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers like Abbott. Any significant breach, attack or other disruption involving Abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business. 9 Abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested. Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott’s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer. The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer. The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability. Abbott has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility. As of December 31, 2020, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $18.7 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Further, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition. Additionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility. 10 Legal and Regulatory Risks Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. Abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, or diagnostic product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs. In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott’s products, and criminal prosecution. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott’s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott’s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability and financial condition. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. Abbott’s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott’s business. Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott’s products’ coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott’s products or the prices that Abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them. Further, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services. These provisions may be modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law. For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” 11 The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott’s future revenues and operating income. Many of Abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott’s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott’s intellectual property rights, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “Legal Proceedings.” Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition. Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for, or injury to, patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition. Economic and Industry Risks Abbott is subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic. As a global healthcare company, public health crises, such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact Abbott's operations. Health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause significant reductions in demand for routine diagnostic testing and medical device procedures or increased difficulty in serving customers, disrupt manufacturing and supply chains, and negatively affect our operations as well as the operations of our suppliers, distributors and other third-party partners. Furthermore, such widespread outbreaks may impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for several COVID-19 related products in 2020, including Abbott diagnostic tests. EUAs are authorized for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency unless sooner terminated or revoked. Abbott is actively pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory approval process for these diagnostic tests which has uncertainty as discussed in “ Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. ” in “Legal and Regulatory Risks” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. A more detailed discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott’s business is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. 12 Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income. In the United States and other countries, Abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “Regulation.” To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Competitors’ intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition. Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition. New products and technological advances by Abbott’s competitors may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations. Abbott’s products face intense competition from competitive products. Competitors’ products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott’s products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products. Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and Abbott’s ability to realize projected sales and earnings. Although Abbott’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2020 made up approximately 62 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott’s assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks. Information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott’s financial results is contained in the “Financial Review — Results of Operations” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott’s 2020 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this report. Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott’s customers depend on payment by government health care systems. The international nature of Abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. Abbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2020 made up approximately 62 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott’s international operations include: 13 Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect Abbott’s profitability and its financial condition, including: 14 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, and projections.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. Sales in international markets comprise approximately 62 percent of consolidated net sales. In 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected Abbott’s diversified health care businesses in various ways. As is further described below, some businesses have performed at the levels required to successfully meet new demands, others have faced challenges, and still others have been relatively less impacted by the pandemic. Abbott’s Diagnostics business experienced the most significant change in sales from 2019 to 2020 as sales from new tests and other related products to detect COVID-19 more than outweighed the negative impact of COVID-19 on routine diagnostic testing volumes. Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch the following new diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in 2020: 21 In 2020, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing related sales totaled approximately $3.884 billion, led by sales related to Abbott’s BinaxNOW, Panbio and ID NOW rapid testing platforms. In addition to negatively impacting routine core diagnostic testing volumes, the pandemic negatively affected the number of cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures performed by health care providers globally, thereby reducing the demand for Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices and routine diagnostic tests in 2020. The decrease began in February in China as that country implemented quarantine restrictions and postponed non-emergency health care activities. The negative impact on cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures and routine diagnostic tests expanded to other countries and geographic regions as COVID-19 spread geographically in the first half of 2020 and health care systems in these countries shifted their focus to fighting COVID-19. The extent of the impact and the timing of a recovery in the number of procedures and routine testing in a particular country or geographic region depended upon the progression of COVID-19 cases in the country or region. The recovery in procedures and routine testing volumes in China began in March. In other parts of the world, such as the U.S. and Europe, volumes improved across Abbott’s hospital-based businesses as the second quarter progressed and the improvement continued in the third quarter. However, in the fourth quarter, the improving trends in the demand for procedures and routine testing flattened or were negatively impacted depending upon the business and the region as many countries experienced an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Abbott’s branded generic pharmaceuticals business was also negatively affected by the pandemic in 2020 as COVID-19 spread across emerging market countries in the second and third quarters of 2020. Abbott’s nutritional and diabetes care businesses were the least affected by the pandemic as is further discussed below. Abbott is continually implementing business continuity plans in the face of the pandemic. Due to the critical nature of its products and services, Abbott was generally exempt from governmental orders issued during the first quarter of 2020 in the U.S. and other countries requiring businesses to cease operations. The majority of its office-based work was conducted remotely during the period of such governmental orders and the company implemented strict travel restrictions. As some governmental orders were lifted in May and June 2020, Abbott entered a new phase in its operations whereby some office-based employees started working at Abbott’s offices on a rotational basis. As various governmental orders and guidelines were modified in the fourth quarter to put in place new restrictions, Abbott continued to ensure that its guidance was aligned with such restrictions. Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees. Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. While Abbott’s 2020 sales were most significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in total sales over the last three years also reflects volume growth due to the introduction of new products across various businesses as well as higher sales of various existing products. Sales in emerging markets, which represent approximately 37 percent of total company sales, increased 2.0 percent in 2020 and 8.2 percent in 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. (Emerging markets include all countries except the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.) Over the last three years, Abbott’s operating margin as a percentage of sales increased from 11.9 percent in 2018 to 14.2 percent in 2019 and 15.5 percent in 2020. The increase in 2020 reflects the sales volume increases in the rapid and molecular diagnostics businesses, partially offset by lower Medical Devices sales due to the impact of the pandemic and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. In addition, a reduction in the costs associated with business acquisitions and restructuring activities drove an improvement in operating margins from 2018 to 2020. In 2019, the increase in Abbott’s operating margin also reflects margin improvement in various businesses and lower intangible amortization expense compared to 2018. With respect to the performance of each reportable segment over the last three years, sales in the Medical Devices segment excluding the impact of foreign exchange decreased 3.8 percent in 2020 and increased 10.5 percent in 2019. The sales decrease in 2020 was driven by Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due primarily to reduced procedure volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care. The sales increase in 2019 was driven primarily by higher Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure sales. 22 In 2020, operating earnings for the Medical Devices segment decreased 19.4 percent. The operating margin profile decreased from 30.8 percent of sales in 2019 to 25.8 percent in 2020 primarily due to lower sales and manufacturing volumes as a result of the pandemic and pricing pressures on drug eluting stents (DES) as a result of market competition in the U.S. and other major markets. In 2020, key product approvals in the Medical Devices segment included: In Abbott’s worldwide diagnostics business, sales increased 40.6 percent in 2020 and 5.9 percent in 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As was discussed above, sales growth in 2020 was driven by demand for Abbott's portfolio of COVID-19 diagnostics tests across its rapid and lab-based platforms, partially offset by lower volumes of routine laboratory testing due to the pandemic. Growth in 2019 reflected continued market penetration by the core laboratory business in the U.S. and internationally. The 2019 growth included the continued adoption by customers of Alinity, which is Abbott’s integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems and solutions that are designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space, generating test results faster and minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results. Abbott has regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, China, and other markets for the “Alinity c” and “Alinity i” instruments and has continued to build out its test menu for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics. Abbott has obtained regulatory approval for the “Alinity h” instrument for hematology in Europe and Japan. Abbott has also obtained regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe for the “Alinity s” (blood screening) and “Alinity m” (molecular) instruments and several testing assays. In 2020, operating earnings for the Diagnostics segment increased 94.8 percent. The operating margin profile increased from 24.9 percent of sales in 2018 to 34.5 percent in 2020 primarily due to higher sales in 2020 in Rapid Diagnostics and Molecular Diagnostics, partially offset by lower volumes of routine testing in Core Laboratory. 23 In Abbott’s worldwide nutritional products business, sales over the last three years were positively impacted by numerous new product introductions, including the roll-outs of human milk oligosaccharide, or HMO, in infant formula and of high-protein Ensure ® , that leveraged Abbott’s strong brands. Sales were also positively affected by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total adult nutrition sales increased 10.3 percent in 2020 and 6.6 percent in 2019 led by the continued growth of Ensure, Abbott’s market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna ® , Abbott’s market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand, across several countries. The 2019 sales growth was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the discontinuation of a non-core product line in the U.S. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total pediatric nutrition sales increased 0.3 percent in 2020 and 3.4 percent in 2019 driven by the PediaSure ® and Pedialyte ® brands in the U.S. as well as infant and toddler product growth across several markets in Asia and Latin America, partially offset by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China. The 2020 increase was also driven by higher Similac ® sales in the U.S. The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Established Pharmaceutical sales increased 1.9 percent in 2020 and 7.3 percent in 2019. The sales increases in 2020 and 2019 reflect higher sales in several geographies including India, China, Brazil and Russia. Operating margins decreased from 20.2 percent of sales in 2018 to 18.5 percent in 2020 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, product mix and lower gross margins. With respect to Abbott’s financial position, at December 31, 2020, Abbott’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments total approximately $7.1 billion compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Abbott’s long-term debt and short-term borrowings total $18.7 billion and $18.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Abbott declared dividends of $1.53 per share in 2020 compared to $1.32 per share in 2019, an increase of approximately 16 percent. Dividends paid totaled $2.560 billion in 2020 compared to $2.270 billion in 2019. The year-over-year change in the amount of dividends paid primarily reflects the increase in the dividend rate. In December 2020, Abbott increased the company’s quarterly dividend by 25 percent to $0.45 per share from $0.36 per share, effective with the dividend paid in February 2021. In 2021, Abbott will focus on continuing to meet the demand for COVID-19 tests and will continue to invest in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth over the next several years. In its diagnostics business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving market adoption and geographic expansion of its Alinity suite of diagnostics instruments. In the medical devices business, Abbott will continue to focus on expanding its market position in various areas including diabetes care, structural heart, electrophysiology, and heart failure. In its nutritionals business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving growth globally and further enhancing its portfolio with the introduction of line extensions of its science-based products. In the established pharmaceuticals business, Abbott will continue to focus on growing its business with the depth and breadth of its portfolio in emerging markets. 24 Critical Accounting Policies Sales Rebates — In 2020, approximately 41 percent of Abbott’s consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances in 2020 are in the Nutritional Products and Diabetes Care businesses. Abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to approximately $3.3 billion, $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, or 20.1 percent, 19.1 percent and 19.0 percent of gross sales, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $16.6 billion, $16.3 billion and $16.0 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one-percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $166 million in 2020. Abbott considers a one-percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $207 million, $169 million and $175 million for cash discounts in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $232 million, $192 million and $191 million for returns in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott’s historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals. In the WIC business, estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott holds the WIC contract. The state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price, is reliably determinable. Rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years. Except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the states submitting rebate claims. The USDA, which administers the WIC program, has been making its data available for many years. Management also estimates the states' processing lag time based on sales and claims data. Inventory in the retail distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management has access to several large customers' inventory management data, which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel. At December 31, 2020, Abbott had WIC business in 27 states. Historically, adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. Income Taxes — Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items is often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. In accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. 25 Pension and Post-Employment Benefits — Abbott offers pension benefits and post-employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for years, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. Low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 2020, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were net losses of $4.6 billion for Abbott’s defined benefit plans and net losses of $419 million for Abbott’s medical and dental plans. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post-employment benefits. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five-year period. Valuation of Intangible Assets — Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott’s critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. At December 31, 2020, goodwill amounted to $23.7 billion and net intangibles amounted to $14.8 billion. Amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $2.1 billion in 2020, $1.9 billion in 2019 and $2.2 billion in 2018. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Litigation — Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $90 million to $120 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Accruals of approximately $105 million have been recorded at December 31, 2020 for these proceedings and exposures. These accruals represent management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” 26 Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last two years: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Components of % Change ​ ​ Total ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ % Change Price Volume Exchange Total Net Sales 2020 vs. 2019 8.5 (0.4) 10.2 (1.3) 2019 vs. 2018 4.3 0.2 7.3 (3.2) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total U.S. ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 vs. 2019 14.2 (1.1) 15.3 — 2019 vs. 2018 5.2 (0.4) 5.6 — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total International ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 vs. 2019 5.3 0.1 7.2 (2.0) 2019 vs. 2018 3.9 0.5 8.3 (4.9) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Established Pharmaceutical Products Segment ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 vs. 2019 (4.1) 2.7 (0.8) (6.0) 2019 vs. 2018 1.4 3.0 4.3 (5.9) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritional Products Segment ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 vs. 2019 3.2 0.8 3.9 (1.5) 2019 vs. 2018 2.5 0.9 3.9 (2.3) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostic Products Segment ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 vs. 2019 40.1 (0.8) 41.4 (0.5) 2019 vs. 2018 2.9 (0.5) 6.4 (3.0) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices Segment ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 vs. 2019 (3.7) (1.9) (1.9) 0.1 2019 vs. 2018 7.6 (0.9) 11.4 (2.9) ​ The increase in Total Net Sales in 2020 reflects volume growth in the Diagnostics and Nutritional Products segments. In Medical Devices, the impact of COVID-19 on Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses was partially offset by double-digit volume growth in Diabetes Care. The increase in Total Net Sales in 2019 reflects volume growth across all of Abbott’s segments. The price declines related to the Medical Devices segment in 2020 and 2019 primarily reflect DES pricing pressures as a result of market competition in the U.S. and other major markets. 27 A comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows.

Total Established Pharmaceutical Products sales increased 1.9 percent in 2020 and 7.3 percent in 2019, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is focused on several key emerging markets including India, Russia, China and Brazil. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total sales in these key emerging markets increased 2.6 percent in 2020 and 7.9 percent in 2019 due to higher sales in several geographies including China, Brazil, India and Russia. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales in Established Pharmaceuticals’ other emerging markets decreased 0.5 percent in 2020 and increased 5.6 percent in 2019. Total Nutritional Products sales increased 4.7 percent in 2020 and 4.8 percent in 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In 2020, International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 4.1 percent as growth across Abbott’s pediatric products in various countries in Southeast Asia was more than offset by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China. The 4.6 percent increase in 2019 International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by growth across Abbott’s portfolio, including Similac and PediaSure in various countries in Asia and Latin America and Pedialyte in Latin America. This growth was partially offset by challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China. In the U.S. Pediatric Nutritional business, sales increased 5.8 percent in 2020 and 1.9 percent in 2019, reflecting growth in Similac in 2020 and growth in PediaSure and Pedialyte in both years. 29 In the International Adult Nutritional business, sales increased 13.6 percent and 10.9 percent in 2020 and 2019, respectively, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to continued growth of Ensure and Glucerna in several countries. In 2020 U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 4.9 percent, primarily due to growth of Ensure. In 2019, U.S. Adult Nutritional sales were unchanged from 2018 due to the impact of Abbott’s discontinuation of a non-core product line during the third quarter of 2018 that was offset by growth in other areas of the business. In the Diagnostics segment, Core Laboratory sales decreased 2.8 percent in 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, as the lower volume of routine testing performed in hospital and other laboratories due to COVID-19 was partially offset by sales of Abbott’s COVID-19 laboratory-based tests for the detection of the IgG and IgM antibodies, which determine if someone was previously infected with the virus. Core Laboratory antibody testing-related sales on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were $268 million in 2020. The 225.7 percent increase in Molecular Diagnostics sales in 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects higher volumes due to demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 on its m2000 and Alinity m platforms. Abbott received U.S. FDA approval in March 2020 for its Alinity m molecular diagnostics system. Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $1.023 billion in 2020. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 112.3 percent in 2020, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to strong demand for Abbott’s point-of-care COVID-19 molecular test on its ID NOW platform and its BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test in the U.S. as well as international demand for COVID-19 rapid tests on its Panbio system and increased testing in the first quarter for the flu in the U.S. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on routine diagnostic testing. Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $2.593 billion in 2020. In the Diagnostics segment, the sales increase in 2019 was driven by above-market growth in Core Laboratory in the U.S. and internationally, where Abbott achieved continued adoption of its Alinity family of diagnostic instruments. The 6.3 percent decrease in 2019 Molecular sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects the negative impact of lower non-governmental organization purchases in Africa. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales growth in 2019 in various areas, including infectious disease testing in developed markets and cardio-metabolic testing, was mostly offset by lower than expected infectious disease testing sales in Africa. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales decreased 3.8 percent and increased 10.5 percent in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was more than offset by decreases in Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower vascular sales in China in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of a new national tender program. The 2019 sales increase was driven by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure. The 2020 and 2019 growth in Diabetes Care revenue was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre, Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, internationally and in the U.S. In 2020, FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $2.635 billion, which reflected a 42.6 percent increase over 2019, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. FreeStyle Libre sales in 2019 were $1.842 billion, which reflected a 69.8 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over 2018 when sales totaled $1.128 billion. In 2019, growth in Structural Heart revenue was broad-based across several areas of the business, including MitraClip, Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR), a leaky heart valve. 2019 growth in Electrophysiology revenue reflects higher sales of cardiac diagnostic and ablation catheters in both the U.S. and internationally. The growth in Heart Failure revenue in 2019 was driven by rapid market adoption in the U.S. of Abbott's HeartMate 3 ® Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) following FDA approval in October 2018 as a destination (long-term use) therapy for people living with advanced heart failure as well as higher sales of Abbott’s CardioMEMS ® heart failure monitoring system. In Vascular, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, sales in 2019 were flat as the 1.3 percent increase in coronary and endovascular product sales, which includes drug-eluting stents, balloon catheters, guidewires, vascular imaging/diagnostics products, vessel closure, carotid and other coronary and peripheral products, was offset by reductions in royalty and contract manufacturing revenue. In Rhythm Management, higher 2019 international sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, were offset by a 4.4 percent decrease in U.S. revenue. In 2019, the 2.4 percent decline in Neuromodulation sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects a 4.2 percent decline in U.S. sales. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non-strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbott’s revenue recognition policies as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were not significant in 2020, 2019 and 2018. 30 The expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. There are no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to materially affect Abbott. In April 2017, Abbott received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA related to its manufacturing facility in Sylmar, CA which was acquired by Abbott on January 4, 2017 as part of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical). This facility manufactures implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, and monitors. Abbott prepared and executed a comprehensive plan of corrective actions. On April 28, 2020, Abbott received a letter from the FDA indicating that, based on the FDA’s evaluation, it appeared that Abbott had addressed the items in the warning letter. As a result, the warning letter is considered closed. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 50.5 percent of net sales in 2020, 52.5 percent in 2019 and 51.3 percent in 2018. In 2020, the decrease primarily reflects the mix of sales across Abbott’s various businesses and operational inefficiencies due to the impact of COVID-19, as well as the increase in intangible asset amortization, the impairment of intangible assets and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on gross margin in 2020. In 2019, the increase primarily reflects lower intangible amortization expense and lower integration and restructuring costs. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $2.4 billion in 2020 and 2019, and $2.3 billion in 2018. R&D spending in 2020 was relatively flat compared to 2019 as the impact of the immediate expensing in 2019 of an R&D asset valued at $102 million that was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc. (Cephea) was partially offset by the $55 million impairment of an in-process R&D intangible asset in 2020. R&D expense in 2020 also reflects lower integration and restructuring costs in 2020 related to R&D, partially offset by higher spending on various projects. R&D expenses in 2019 increased 6.1 percent, primarily reflecting the immediate expensing of the Cephea R&D asset as well as higher R&D spending in various businesses, primarily in Medical Devices, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange. In 2020, R&D expenditures totaled $1.3 billion for the Medical Devices segment, $608 million for the Diagnostic Products segment, $189 million for the Nutritional Products segment and $177 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were basically flat in 2020 and 2019 versus the respective prior years. In 2020, the favorable effect of foreign exchange, income of approximately $100 million from a litigation settlement in 2020, lower spending due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, and the impact of various cost saving initiatives were offset by higher spending to drive growth in various businesses. In 2019, the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower acquisition-related integration costs offset higher selling and marketing costs to drive continued growth across various businesses. Restructurings From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2017, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $68 million. From 2018 to 2020, Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges totaling approximately $137 million, comprised of $13 million in 2020, $72 million in 2019 and $52 million in 2018. Approximately $30 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $15 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $92 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense over the last three years. As of December 31, 2020, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $25 million and primarily represent severance obligations. From 2016 to 2020, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $36 million in 2020, $66 million in 2019 and $28 million in 2018. Approximately $6 million in 2020, $16 million in 2019 and $10 million in 2018 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $2 million in 2020, $28 million in 2019 and $2 million in 2018 are recorded in Research and development, and approximately $28 million in 2020, $22 million in 2019 and $16 million in 2018 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. 31 Interest Expense and Interest (Income) Interest expense, net decreased $76 million in 2020 due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in November 2019, the repayment of debt in December 2019 and a lower interest rate environment in 2020. In 2019, interest expense, net decreased $145 million due to the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in September 2018, as well as the repayment of debt in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. Debt Extinguishment Costs On December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.9% Notes due 2021. Abbott incurred a charge of $63 million related to the early repayment of this debt. On October 28, 2018, Abbott redeemed approximately $4 billion of debt, which included $750 million principal amount of its 2.00% Notes due 2020; $597 million principal amount of its 4.125% Notes due 2020; $900 million principal amount of its 3.25% Notes due 2023; $450 million principal amount of its 3.4% Notes due 2023; and $1.300 billion principal amount of its 3.75% Notes due 2026. Abbott incurred a net charge of $153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps. On March 22, 2018, Abbott redeemed all of the $947 million principal amount of its 5.125% Notes due 2019, as well as $1.055 billion of the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.35% Notes due 2019. Abbott incurred a net charge of $14 million related to the early repayment of this debt. Other (Income) Expense, net Other (income) expense, net, for 2020, 2019 and 2018 includes approximately $205 million, $225 million, and $160 million of income in each year, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. Other (income) expense, net for 2020 also includes equity investment impairments that totaled approximately $115 million. Taxes on Earnings The income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 10.0 percent in 2020, 9.6 percent in 2019 and 18.8 percent in 2018. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, and approximately $100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $26 million increase to the transition tax associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The $26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.53 billion. In 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included approximately $100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation, an $86 million reduction of the transition tax and $68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India. The $86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2019. In 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included $98 million of net tax expense related to the settlement of Abbott’s 2014-2016 federal income tax audit in the U.S., partial settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group’s 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in the U.S. and audit settlements in various countries as well as approximately $90 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2018, Abbott also recorded $130 million of additional tax expense related to the TCJA; the $130 million reflected a $120 million increase in the transition tax from $2.89 billion to $3.01 billion and a $10 million reduction in the net benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. 32 Exclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore, and Malta. Abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules, tax rulings, grants, and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate. Discontinued Operations The net earnings of discontinued operations include income tax benefits of $24 million in 2020 and $39 million in 2018. The 2020 tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to Abbott’s developed markets branded generic pharmaceuticals business which was sold to Mylan Inc. (Mylan) in 2015. The tax positions relate to years prior to the sale to Mylan. The 2018 tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to the operations of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) for years prior to the separation. Abbott completed the separation of AbbVie, which was formed to hold Abbott’s research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business, in January 2013. Abbott retained all liabilities for all U.S. federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation. Research and Development Programs Abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development. Research and Development Process In the Established Pharmaceuticals segment, the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment’s existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. As Established Pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity. Depending upon the product, the phases of development may include: The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations, new indications, or geographic expansion in specific countries, such as China. In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include: 33 The regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions. In the U.S., the FDA classifies diagnostic products into classes (I, II, or III) and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval. While the Diagnostics segment has products in all three classes, the vast majority of its products are categorized as Class I or Class II. Submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for Class I products. Class II devices typically require pre-market notification to the FDA through a regulatory filing known as a 510(k) submission. Most Class III products are subject to the FDA’s Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. Other Class III products, such as those used to screen blood, require the submission and approval of a Biological License Application (BLA). In the European Union (EU), diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process, which has been governed by the European In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive, depends upon the category, with certain product categories requiring review and approval by an independent company, known as a Notified Body, before the manufacturer can affix a CE mark to the product to declare conformity to the Directive. Other products only require a self-certification process. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) which replaces the existing directive in the EU for in vitro diagnostic products. The IVDR will apply after a five-year transition period and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. In the Medical Devices segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product’s safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications. Similar to the diagnostic products discussed above, in the U.S., medical devices are classified as Class I, II, or III. Most of Abbott’s medical device products are classified as Class II devices that follow the 510(k) regulatory process or Class III devices that are subject to the PMA process. In the EU, medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which has been governed by the European Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, varies by class. Each product must bear a CE mark to show compliance with the Directive. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) which replaces the existing directives in the EU for medical devices and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. While the MDR was previously adopted to apply after a three year transition period, in 2020 the European Parliament postponed the date of application by one year. Some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to CE marking of the device. For other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self-certify its ability to apply the CE mark to the product. Outside the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions. After approval and commercial launch of some medical devices, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority. In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product’s efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. In the U.S., the FDA requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products. Prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the FDA’s confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. For other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products. 34 Areas of Focus In 2021 and beyond, Abbott’s significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following: Established Pharmaceuticals — Abbott focuses on building country-specific portfolios made up of high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. Over the next several years, Abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of being among the first to launch new off-patent and differentiated medicines. In addition, Abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. Abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as Creon™, Duphaston™, Duphalac™ and Influvac™. Depending on the product, the activities focus on development of new data, markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications. One example includes the launch of Abbott’s quadrivalent influenza vaccination Influvac® Tetra in 12 markets and an expanded indication in 16 markets to cover children, adolescents and young adults from 3 to 17 years old. Medical Devices — Abbott’s research and development programs focus on: Nutritionals — Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastro intestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years. Core Laboratory Diagnostics — Abbott continues to commercialize its next-generation blood screening, immunoassay, clinical chemistry and hematology systems, along with assays, including a focus on unmet medical need, in various areas including infectious disease, cardiac care, metabolics, and oncology, as well as informatics solutions to help optimize diagnostics laboratory performance and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories. Molecular Diagnostics — Several new molecular in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests are in various stages of development and launch. Rapid Diagnostics — Abbott’s research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for infectious disease, cardiometabolic disease and toxicology. In addition, the Diagnostics Divisions are pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory process for various COVID-19 tests for which an EUA was obtained in 2020. 35 Given the diversity of Abbott’s business, its intention to remain a broad-based health care company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott’s total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott’s overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott’s 2020 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations. While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott’s ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device, diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is expected to approximate 7.0 percent of total Abbott sales in 2021. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period. Goodwill At December 31, 2020, goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled $23.7 billion. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs, using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. The results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities amounted to $7.9 billion, $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in Net cash from operating activities in 2020 was primarily due to the favorable cash flow impact of higher segment operating earnings, lower payments related to interest, integration expenses, and restructuring actions, and the proceeds from a litigation settlement partially offset by an increased investment in working capital and higher income tax payments. The decrease in Net cash from operating activities in 2019 was primarily due to an increased investment in working capital, timing of pension contributions relative to 2018 and higher income tax payments, partially offset by the favorable cash flow impact of improved segment operating earnings and lower interest and acquisition-related expenses. While a significant portion of Abbott’s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, are reinvested in foreign subsidiaries, Abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. Due to the enactment of the TCJA, if these funds were needed for operations in the U.S., Abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds. Abbott funded $400 million in 2020, $382 million in 2019 and $114 million in 2018 to defined benefit pension plans. Abbott expects pension funding of approximately $410 million in 2021 for its pension plans. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbott’s capital expenditures and cash dividends. Debt and Capital At December 31, 2020, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was A by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A3 by Moody’s. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. 36 Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. The lines of credit are part of a Five Year Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) that Abbott entered into on November 12, 2020. At that time, Abbott also terminated its 2018 revolving credit agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2018 revolving credit agreement at the time of its termination. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on November 12, 2025. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest, at Abbott’s option, based on either a base rate or Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings. In 2020, financing activities related to the issuance and repayment of long-term debt included the following: As of December 31, 2020, Abbott’s total debt is $18.7 billion. In 2018 and 2019, Abbott committed to reducing its debt levels which had increased as part of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere in 2017. In 2018, net repayments totaled approximately $8.3 billion of debt. On February 24, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $500 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.80% Notes due 2020. In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. This bond redemption authorization superseded the board’s previous authorization under which $700 million had not yet been redeemed. On December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion outstanding principal amount of its 2.90% Notes due 2021. $2.15 billion of the 2019 $5 billion redemption authorization remains available as of December 31, 2020. On November 19, 2019, Abbott’s wholly owned subsidiary, Abbott Ireland Financing DAC, completed a euro debt offering of €1.180 billion of long-term debt. The proceeds equated to approximately $1.3 billion. The Notes are guaranteed by Abbott. On November 21, 2019, Abbott borrowed ¥59.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The term loan bears interest at TIBOR plus a fixed spread, and the interest rate is reset quarterly. The proceeds equated to approximately $550 million. In total, these 2019 transactions resulted in the repayment of approximately of $1.6 billion of debt, net of borrowings. In September 2014, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. Under the program authorized in 2014, Abbott repurchased 36.2 million shares at a cost of $1.666 billion in 2015, 10.4 million shares at a cost of $408 million in 2016, 1.9 million shares at a cost of $130 million in 2018, 6.3 million shares at a cost of $525 million in 2019, and 1.6 million shares at a cost of $173 million in 2020 for a total of approximately $2.9 billion. In October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. The 2019 authorization is in addition to the approximately $100 million unused portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2014. On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. No shares have been issued under this authorization. Abbott declared dividends of $1.53 per share in 2020 compared to $1.32 per share in 2019, an increase of approximately 16 percent. Dividends paid were $2.560 billion in 2020 compared to $2.270 billion in 2019. The year-over-year change in dividends paid primarily reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate. 37 Working Capital Working capital was $8.5 billion at December 31, 2020 and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase was due in large part to the higher level of cash and cash equivalents, which was due primarily to the increase in cash generated from operating activities, and the repayment of the current portion of long term debt after the issuance of new long term notes in 2020. Working capital also increased due to the higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by an increase in accounts payable associated with the growth of the business. Abbott monitors the credit worthiness of customers and establishes an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $2.2 billion in 2020, $1.6 billion in 2019 and $1.4 billion in 2018 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers. The 2020 increase in capital expenditures primarily reflects the building of capacity for the manufacture of COVID-19 diagnostics tests. Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes Abbott’s estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Payments Due By Period ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2026 and (in millions) Total 2021 2022 ‑ 2023 2024 ‑ 2025 Thereafter Long‑term debt, including current maturities ​ $ 18,490 ​ $ 7 ​ $ 3,203 ​ $ 2,802 ​ $ 12,478 Interest on debt obligations ​ 9,011 ​ 596 ​ 1,152 ​ 1,024 ​ 6,239 Operating lease obligations ​ 1,315 ​ 272 ​ 405 ​ 231 ​ 407 Purchase commitments (a) ​ 4,757 ​ 4,192 ​ 478 ​ 77 ​ 10 Other long‑term liabilities (b) ​ 3,845 ​ — ​ 1,959 ​ 1,266 ​ 620 Total (c) ​ $ 37,418 ​ $ 5,067 ​ $ 7,197 ​ $ 5,400 ​ $ 19,754 ​ 38 Contingent Obligations Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. Legislative Issues Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2021. Adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on Abbott’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings (Earnings employed in the business). Abbott adopted the new standard at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result of the adoption of the new standard, approximately $337 million of stranded tax effects were reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Earnings employed in the business. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which requires the recognition of the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the period in which the transfer occurs. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that was not significant. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses , which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors. ​ ​ 39 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments and Risk Management Market Price Sensitive Investments The fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $20 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2020 by approximately $4 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $366 million and $346 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments, as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings. Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $113 million and $158 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $15 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $2.9 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2020 and 2019 amounted to $22.8 billion and $20.8 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.3% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019) with maturities through 2046. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values. Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Abbott held $8.1 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2020 will mature in 2021 or 2022 depending upon the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2019 matured in 2020 or will mature in 2021 depending upon the contract. Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Abbott held $11.0 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next 13 months. 40 In November 2019, Abbott borrowed ¥59.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The proceeds equated to approximately $550 million. The value of this long-term debt was approximately $577 million and $546 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 ​ 2019 ​ ​ ​ Weighted Fair and ​ ​ Weighted Fair and ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ Carrying Value ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ Carrying Value ​ ​ Contract ​ Exchange ​ Receivable/ ​ Contract ​ Exchange ​ Receivable/ (dollars in millions) ​ Amount ​ Rate ​ (Payable) ​ Amount ​ Rate ​ (Payable) Primarily U.S. Dollars to be exchanged for the following currencies: ​ ​ ​ ​ Euro ​ $ 7,781 1.1821 ​ $ (91) ​ $ 7,085 1.1189 ​ $ 65 Chinese Yuan ​ 2,401 6.4900 ​ (99) ​ 2,177 7.0216 ​ 4 Japanese Yen ​ 1,589 105.3861 ​ (20) ​ 1,092 106.8530 ​ 13 All other currencies ​ 7,369 n/a ​ (198) ​ 5,532 n/a ​ (23) Total ​ $ 19,140 ​ ​ $ (408) ​ $ 15,886 ​ $ 59 ​ ​ ​ 41 ITEM 8.

Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies NATURE OF BUSINESS — Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. USE OF ESTIMATES — The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for sales rebates, income taxes, pension and other post-employment benefits, valuation of intangible assets, litigation, derivative financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION — The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. REVENUE RECOGNITION — Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Revenue from the launch of a new product, from an improved version of an existing product, or for shipments in excess of a customer’s normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve for such revenue, if necessary. In certain of Abbott’s businesses, primarily within diagnostics, Abbott participates in selling arrangements that include multiple performance obligations (e.g., instruments, reagents, procedures, and service agreements). The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Sales of product rights for marketable products are recorded as revenue upon disposition of the rights. INCOME TAXES — Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when the taxes are paid. No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, the TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Abbott treats the GILTI tax as a period expense and provides for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings. EARNINGS PER SHARE — Unvested restricted stock units and awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $ 4.449 billion, $ 3.666 billion and $ 2.320 billion, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $ 4.473 billion, $ 3.666 billion and $ 2.353 billion, respectively. ​ 49 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) PENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS — Abbott accrues for the actuarially determined cost of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a five-year period. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS — For assets and liabilities that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs are valued by reference to similar assets or liabilities, adjusted for contract restrictions and other terms specific to that asset or liability. For these items, a significant portion of fair value is derived by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets. For all remaining assets and liabilities, fair value is derived using a fair value model, such as a discounted cash flow model or Black-Scholes model. Purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value. The fair value of significant purchased intangible assets is based on independent appraisals. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION — The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards and units are amortized over their requisite service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible, with a charge to compensation expense. LITIGATION — Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. Legal fees are recorded as incurred. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS — Cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits, U.S. government securities money market funds and U.S. treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less. Abbott holds certain investments with a carrying value of $ 277 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments held in a rabbi trust and investments in publicly traded equity securities are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. Investments in equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity, as management has both the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity, and are reported at cost, net of any unamortized premium or discount. Income relating to these securities is reported as interest income. TRADE RECEIVABLE VALUATIONS — Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. Accounts receivable are charged off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted. INVENTORIES — Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost includes material and conversion costs. ​ 50 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT — Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table shows estimated useful lives of property and equipment: ​ ​ ​ ​ Classification Estimated Useful Lives Buildings 10 to 50 years Equipment 2 to 20 years ​ PRODUCT LIABILITY — Abbott accrues for product liability claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The liabilities are adjusted quarterly as additional information becomes available. Product liability losses are self-insured. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS — Internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) — The initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completed and are then amortized over the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant. CONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES — Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. Product warranties are not significant. Abbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. ​ ​ Note 2 – New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings (Earnings employed in the business). Abbott adopted the new standard at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result of the adoption of the new standard, approximately $ 337 million of stranded tax effects were reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Earnings employed in the business. ​ 51 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2 — New Accounting Standards (Continued) In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which requires the recognition of the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the period in which the transfer occurs. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that was not significant. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses , which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2021. Adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on Abbott’s consolidated financial statements. ​ Note 3 — Revenue Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott's products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians' offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. ​ 52 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) The following tables provide detail by sales category: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 ​ 2019 ​ 2018 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 3,209 ​ $ 3,209 ​ $ — ​ $ 3,392 ​ $ 3,392 ​ $ — ​ $ 3,363 ​ $ 3,363 Other ​ — ​ 1,094 ​ 1,094 ​ — ​ 1,094 ​ 1,094 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 1,059 ​ ​ 1,059 Total ​ — ​ 4,303 ​ 4,303 ​ — ​ 4,486 ​ 4,486 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 4,422 ​ ​ 4,422 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 1,987 ​ 2,140 ​ 4,127 ​ 1,879 ​ 2,282 ​ 4,161 ​ ​ 1,843 ​ ​ 2,254 ​ ​ 4,097 Adult Nutritionals ​ 1,292 ​ 2,228 ​ 3,520 ​ 1,231 ​ 2,017 ​ 3,248 ​ ​ 1,232 ​ ​ 1,900 ​ ​ 3,132 Total ​ 3,279 ​ 4,368 ​ 7,647 ​ 3,110 ​ 4,299 ​ 7,409 ​ ​ 3,075 ​ ​ 4,154 ​ ​ 7,229 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 1,166 ​ 3,309 ​ 4,475 ​ 1,086 ​ 3,570 ​ 4,656 ​ ​ 985 ​ ​ 3,401 ​ ​ 4,386 Molecular ​ 621 ​ 817 ​ 1,438 ​ 149 ​ 293 ​ 442 ​ ​ 152 ​ ​ 332 ​ ​ 484 Point of Care ​ 369 ​ 147 ​ 516 ​ 438 ​ 123 ​ 561 ​ ​ 432 ​ ​ 121 ​ ​ 553 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 2,618 ​ 1,758 ​ 4,376 ​ 1,214 ​ 840 ​ 2,054 ​ ​ 1,148 ​ ​ 924 ​ ​ 2,072 Total ​ 4,774 ​ 6,031 ​ 10,805 ​ 2,887 ​ 4,826 ​ 7,713 ​ ​ 2,717 ​ ​ 4,778 ​ ​ 7,495 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 903 ​ 1,011 ​ 1,914 ​ 1,057 ​ 1,087 ​ 2,144 ​ ​ 1,105 ​ ​ 1,093 ​ ​ 2,198 Electrophysiology ​ 660 ​ 918 ​ 1,578 ​ 742 ​ 979 ​ 1,721 ​ ​ 678 ​ ​ 883 ​ ​ 1,561 Heart Failure ​ 547 ​ 193 ​ 740 ​ 574 ​ 195 ​ 769 ​ ​ 467 ​ ​ 179 ​ ​ 646 Vascular ​ 853 ​ 1,486 ​ 2,339 ​ 1,047 ​ 1,803 ​ 2,850 ​ ​ 1,126 ​ ​ 1,803 ​ ​ 2,929 Structural Heart ​ 540 ​ 707 ​ 1,247 ​ 616 ​ 784 ​ 1,400 ​ ​ 488 ​ ​ 751 ​ ​ 1,239 Neuromodulation ​ 564 ​ 138 ​ 702 ​ 660 ​ 171 ​ 831 ​ ​ 690 ​ ​ 174 ​ ​ 864 Diabetes Care ​ ​ 864 ​ ​ 2,403 ​ ​ 3,267 ​ ​ 678 ​ ​ 1,846 ​ ​ 2,524 ​ ​ 457 ​ ​ 1,476 ​ ​ 1,933 Total ​ 4,931 ​ 6,856 ​ 11,787 ​ 5,374 ​ 6,865 ​ 12,239 ​ ​ 5,011 ​ ​ 6,359 ​ ​ 11,370 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 38 ​ 28 ​ 66 ​ 27 ​ 30 ​ 57 ​ ​ 36 ​ ​ 26 ​ ​ 62 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ $ 13,022 ​ $ 21,586 ​ $ 34,608 ​ $ 11,398 ​ $ 20,506 ​ $ 31,904 ​ $ 10,839 ​ $ 19,739 ​ $ 30,578 ​ Abbott recognizes revenue from product sales upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. For maintenance agreements that provide service beyond Abbott’s standard warranty and other service agreements, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. A time-based measure of progress appropriately reflects the transfer of services to the customer. Payment terms between Abbott and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant. ​ 53 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) Management exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Abbott provides rebates to government agencies, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Other allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott's historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant. Abbott also applies judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts that include multiple performance obligations. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. For goods or services for which observable standalone selling prices are not available, Abbott uses an expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2020, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 3.8 billion in the Diagnostic Products segment and approximately $ 430 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months , approximately 17 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in ASC 606-10-50 -14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. Assets Recognized for Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer Abbott has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and records as an expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers in the period of occurrence when the amortization period of the asset that Abbott otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Upfront commission fees paid to sales personnel as a result of obtaining or renewing contracts with customers are incremental to obtaining the contract. Abbott capitalizes these amounts as contract costs. Capitalized commission fees are amortized based on the contract duration to which the assets relate which ranges from two to ten years . The amounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not significant. ​ 54 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) Additionally, the cost of transmitters provided to customers that use Abbott’s remote monitoring service with respect to certain medical devices are capitalized as contract costs. Capitalized transmitter costs are amortized based on the timing of the transfer of services to which the assets relate, which typically ranges from eight to ten years . The amounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not significant. Other Contract Assets and Liabilities Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Contract Liabilities ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2018 ​ $ 259 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ ​ 411 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ​ ( 376 ) Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ ​ 294 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ 505 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ( 394 ) Balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ 405 ​ ​ Note 4 — Discontinued Operations and Business Dispositions The net earnings of discontinued operations include income tax benefits of $ 24 million in 2020 and $ 39 million in 2018. The 2020 tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to Abbott’s developed markets branded generic pharmaceuticals business which was sold to Mylan Inc. (Mylan) in 2015. The tax positions relate to years prior to the sale to Mylan. The 2018 tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to the operations of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) for years prior to the separation. Abbott completed the separation of AbbVie, which was formed to hold Abbott’s research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business, in January 2013. Abbott retained all liabilities for all U.S. federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation. ​ Note 5 — Supplemental Financial Information Other (income) expense, net, for 2020, 2019 and 2018 includes approximately $ 205 million, $ 225 million and $ 160 million of income, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. 55 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) The following summarizes the activity for 2020 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 228 Impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 ​ ​ 7 Provisions/charges to income ​ 88 Amounts charged off and other deductions ​ ( 35 ) Balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ 288 ​ The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. The detail of various balance sheet components is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Long-term Investments: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 776 ​ $ 836 Other ​ 45 ​ 47 Total ​ $ 821 ​ $ 883 ​ Abbott’s long-term investments as of December 31, 2020 declined versus the balance as of December 31, 2019 due primarily to investment impairments totaling approximately $ 115 million, recorded in Other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, which was partially offset by approximately $ 35 million of additional investments during 2020. Abbott’s equity securities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, include $ 366 million and $ 346 million, respectively, of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. Abbott also holds certain investments as of December 31, 2020 with a carrying value of $ 277 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of $ 113 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The $ 113 million carrying value is net of an approximately $ 60 million impairment of an investment in 2020 for which Abbott had previously recorded an unrealized gain of approximately $ 50 million in 2018. ​ 56 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) In 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc., Abbott acquired a research & development (R&D) asset valued at $ 102 million, which was immediately expensed. The $ 102 million of expense was recorded in the R&D line of Abbott's Consolidated Statement of Earnings. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Other Accrued Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Accrued rebates payable to government agencies ​ $ 316 ​ $ 212 Accrued other rebates (a) ​ 805 ​ 655 All other ​ 4,044 ​ 3,168 Total ​ $ 5,165 ​ $ 4,035 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Post-employment Obligations and Other Long-term Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical and dental plans for significant plans ​ $ 3,119 ​ $ 2,817 Deferred income taxes ​ 1,406 ​ 1,546 Operating lease liabilities ​ ​ 902 ​ ​ 755 All other (b) ​ 3,684 ​ 3,944 Total ​ $ 9,111 ​ $ 9,062 ​ ​ 57 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 6 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The components of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income taxes, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gains (Losses) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative ​ Net Actuarial ​ on Derivative ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreign ​ (Losses) and ​ Instruments ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Currency ​ Prior Service ​ Designated as ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Translation ​ (Costs) and ​ Cash Flow ​ ​ ​ (in millions) Adjustments Credits Hedges Total Balance at December 31, 2018 ​ $ ( 4,912 ) ​ $ ( 2,726 ) ​ $ 52 ​ $ ( 7,586 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ​ ( 12 ) ​ ( 719 ) ​ 2 ​ ( 729 ) (Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (a) ​ ​ — ​ ( 95 ) ​ ( 55 ) ​ ( 150 ) Net current period other comprehensive income (loss) ​ ​ ( 12 ) ​ ( 814 ) ​ ( 53 ) ​ ( 879 ) Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ ​ ( 4,924 ) ​ ​ ( 3,540 ) ​ ​ ( 1 ) ​ ​ ( 8,465 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ​ 65 ​ ( 523 ) ​ ( 140 ) ​ ( 598 ) (Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (a) ​ ​ — ​ 192 ​ ( 75 ) ​ 117 Net current period other comprehensive income (loss) ​ ​ 65 ​ ​ ( 331 ) ​ ​ ( 215 ) ​ ​ ( 481 ) Balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ ( 4,859 ) ​ $ ( 3,871 ) ​ $ ( 216 ) ​ $ ( 8,946 ) ​ ​ Note 7 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 23.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and $ 23.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Foreign currency translation adjustments increased goodwill by approximately $ 550 million in 2020 and decreased goodwill $ 103 million in 2019. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at December 31, 2020 was $ 3.0 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.8 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.6 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2020 and 2019. The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $ 27.8 billion and $ 27.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $ 14.2 billion and $ 11.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Foreign currency translation adjustments increased intangible assets by approximately $ 67 million in 2020 and decreased intangible assets by $ 71 million in 2019. In 2020, asset impairments related to the Medical Devices segment decreased intangible assets by $ 148 million. The impairment was recorded in the Cost of products sold, excluding amortization of intangible assets line of Abbott’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2020 is approximately $ 2.0 billion in 2021, $ 2.0 billion in 2022, $ 1.9 billion in 2023, $ 1.9 billion in 2024 and $ 1.9 billion in 2025. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over 2 to 20 years . 58 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Continued) Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&D acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease is due to an IPR&D intangible asset related to the Medical Devices segment that became amortizable in 2020 and a $ 55 million impairment of an IPR&D intangible asset related to the Medical Devices segment that was recorded in the Research and development line of Abbott’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings in 2020. ​ Note 8 — Restructuring Plans From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2017, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $ 68 million. From 2018 to 2020, Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges totaling approximately $ 137 million, comprised of $ 13 million in 2020, $ 72 million in 2019 and $ 52 million in 2018. Approximately $ 30 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 15 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $ 92 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense over the last three years. As of December 31, 2020, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $ 25 million and primarily represent severance obligations. From 2016 to 2020, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $ 36 million in 2020, $ 66 million in 2019 and $ 28 million in 2018. Approximately $ 6 million in 2020, $ 16 million in 2019 and $ 10 million in 2018 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 2 million in 2020, $ 28 million in 2019 and $ 2 million in 2018 are recorded in Research and development, and approximately $ 28 million in 2020, $ 22 million in 2019 and $ 16 million in 2018 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2017 ​ $ 119 Restructuring charges ​ ​ 28 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 77 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2018 ​ ​ 70 Restructuring charges ​ ​ 66 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 57 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2019 ​ ​ 79 Restructuring charges ​ ​ 36 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 45 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ 70 ​ ​ Note 9 — Incentive Stock Program The 2017 Incentive Stock Program authorizes the granting of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards, foreign benefits and other share-based awards. Stock options and restricted stock awards and units comprise the majority of benefits that have been granted and are currently outstanding under this program and a prior program. In 2020, Abbott granted 4,015,420 stock options, 569,961 restricted stock awards and 5,239,575 restricted stock units under this program. 59 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 9 — Incentive Stock Program (Continued) Under Abbott’s stock incentive programs, the purchase price of shares under option must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the maximum term of an option is 10 years . Options generally vest equally over three years . Restricted stock awards generally vest over 3 years , with no more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year upon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target. Restricted stock units vest over three years and upon vesting, the recipient receives one share of Abbott stock for each vested restricted stock unit. The aggregate fair market value of options and restricted stock awards and units is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which may be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant. Restricted stock awards and settlement of vested restricted stock units are issued out of treasury shares. Abbott generally issues new shares for exercises of stock options. As a policy, Abbott does not purchase its shares relating to its share-based programs. In April 2017, Abbott’s shareholders authorized the 2017 Incentive Stock Program under which a maximum of 170 million shares were available for issuance. At December 31, 2020, approximately 113 million shares remained available for future issuance. The following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2020. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ Average ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ Remaining ​ Aggregate (intrinsic values in millions) Options Exercise Price Life (Years) Intrinsic Value Outstanding at December 31, 2019 ​ 29,877,915 ​ $ 48.78 6.2 $ 1,138 Granted 4,015,420 ​ 87.84 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Exercised ( 4,872,830 ) ​ 39.62 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Lapsed ( 100,619 ) ​ 75.22 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding at December 31, 2020 28,919,886 ​ $ 55.65 6.0 $ 1,557 Exercisable at December 31, 2020 ​ 20,390,745 ​ $ 46.16 ​ 5.0 ​ $ 1,291 ​ The following table summarizes restricted stock awards and units activity for the year ended December 31, 2020. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ ​ ​ Grant-Date ​ ​ Share Units ​ Fair Value Outstanding at December 31, 2019 14,463,314 ​ $ 65.51 Granted 5,809,536 ​ 87.83 Vested ( 7,167,631 ) ​ 60.67 Forfeited ( 612,351 ) ​ 75.16 Outstanding at December 31, 2020 12,492,868 ​ $ 78.19 ​ The fair market value of restricted stock awards and units vested in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 631 million, $ 588 million and $ 458 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 279 million, $ 315 million and $ 249 million, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to all share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2020 amounted to approximately $ 407 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . 60 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 9 — Incentive Stock Program (Continued) Total non-cash stock compensation expense charged against income from continuing operations in 2020, 2019 and 2018 for share-based plans totaled approximately $ 546 million, $ 519 million and $ 477 million, respectively, and the tax benefit recognized was approximately $ 200 million, $ 197 million and $ 185 million, respectively. Stock compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory is not significant. The table below summarizes the fair value of an option granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 and the assumptions included in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model used to estimate the fair value: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 2019 2018 ​ Fair value ​ $ 14.39 ​ $ 14.50 ​ $ 10.93 ​ Risk-free interest rate ​ 1.3 % ​ 2.5 % ​ 2.7 % Average life of options (years) ​ 6.0 ​ ​ 6.0 ​ ​ 6.0 ​ Volatility ​ 19.4 % ​ 19.8 % ​ 19.0 % Dividend yield ​ 1.6 % ​ 1.7 % ​ 1.9 % ​ The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates available at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected life. The average life of an option is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Abbott’s stock and historical volatility of Abbott’s stock over the expected life of the option. Dividend yield is based on the option’s exercise price and annual dividend rate at the time of grant. ​ 61 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 10 — Debt and Lines of Credit The following is a summary of long-term debt at December 31: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 0.00 % Notes, due 2020 ​ $ — ​ $ 1,272 2.55 % Notes, due 2022 ​ ​ 750 ​ ​ 750 0.875 % Notes, due 2023 ​ ​ 1,398 ​ ​ 1,272 3.40 % Notes, due 2023 ​ ​ 1,050 ​ ​ 1,050 5-year term loan due 2024 ​ ​ 577 ​ ​ 546 0.10 % Notes, due 2024 ​ ​ 724 ​ ​ 658 3.875 % Notes, due 2025 ​ ​ 500 ​ ​ 500 2.95 % Notes, due 2025 ​ ​ 1,000 ​ ​ 1,000 1.50 % Notes, due 2026 ​ ​ 1,398 ​ ​ 1,272 3.75 % Notes, due 2026 ​ ​ 1,700 ​ ​ 1,700 0.375 % Notes, due 2027 ​ ​ 724 ​ ​ 658 1.15 % Notes, due 2028 ​ ​ 650 ​ ​ — 1.40 % Notes, due 2030 ​ ​ 650 ​ ​ — 4.75 % Notes, due 2036 ​ ​ 1,650 ​ ​ 1,650 6.15 % Notes, due 2037 ​ 547 ​ 547 6.00 % Notes, due 2039 ​ 515 ​ 515 5.30 % Notes, due 2040 ​ 694 ​ 694 4.75 % Notes, due 2043 ​ 700 ​ 700 4.90 % Notes, due 2046 ​ ​ 3,250 ​ ​ 3,250 Unamortized debt issuance costs ​ ​ ( 87 ) ​ ​ ( 90 ) Other, including fair value adjustments relating to interest rate hedge contracts designated as fair value hedges ​ 144 ​ ( 6 ) Total carrying amount of long-term debt ​ 18,534 ​ 17,938 Less: Current portion ​ 7 ​ 1,277 Total long-term portion ​ $ 18,527 ​ $ 16,661 ​ On June 24, 2020, Abbott completed the issuance of $ 1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $ 650 million of its 1.15 % Notes due 2028 and $ 650 million of its 1.40 % Notes due 2030. On September 28, 2020, Abbott repaid the € 1.140 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.00 % Notes due 2020 upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $ 1.3 billion. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $ 5 billion on an unsecured basis. The lines of credit are part of a Five Year Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) that Abbott entered into on November 12, 2020. At that time, Abbott also terminated its 2018 revolving credit agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2018 revolving credit agreement at the time of its termination. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on November 12, 2025. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest, at Abbott’s option, based on either a base rate or Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings. ​ 62 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 10 — Debt and Lines of Credit (Continued) In 2019, Abbott’s long-term borrowings and debt issuance included the following: In 2019, Abbott’s repayment of long-term debt included the following: The 2.80 % Notes were redeemed under the board of directors’ 2018 bond redemption authorization discussed below. The 2.9 % Notes were redeemed under a bond redemption authorization approved by the board of directors in September 2019 for the early redemption of up to $ 5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. The 2019 bond redemption authorization superseded the board’s 2018 authorization. $ 2.15 billion of the $ 5 billion authorization remans available as of December 31, 2020. On January 5, 2018, Abbott repaid $ 2.8 billion under a 5-year term loan agreement and $ 1.15 billion of borrowings under its lines of credit. On February 16, 2018, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $ 5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. 2018 redemptions under this authorization include the following: Abbott incurred a net charge of $ 14 million related to the March 22, 2018 early repayment of debt. On September 17, 2018, Abbott repaid upon maturity the $ 500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2.00 % Senior Notes due 2018. On September 27, 2018, Abbott’s wholly owned subsidiary, Abbott Ireland Financing DAC, completed a euro debt offering of € 3.420 billion of long-term debt consisting of € 1.140 billion of non-interest bearing Senior Notes due 2020 at 99.727 % of par value; € 1.140 billion of 0.875 % Senior Notes due 2023 at 99.912 % of par value; and € 1.140 billion of 1.50 % Senior Notes due 2026 at 99.723 % of par value. The proceeds equated to approximately $ 4 billion. The notes are guaranteed by Abbott. 63 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 10 — Debt and Lines of Credit (Continued) On October 28, 2018, Abbott redeemed approximately $ 4 billion of debt, which included $ 750 million principal amount of its 2.00 % Notes due 2020; $ 597 million principal amount of its 4.125 % Notes due 2020; $ 900 million principal amount of its 3.25 % Notes due 2023; $ 450 million principal amount of its 3.4 % Notes due 2023; and $ 1.300 billion principal amount of its 3.75 % Notes due 2026. These amounts were in addition to the $ 5 billion authorization in 2018 discussed above. In conjunction with the redemption, Abbott unwound approximately $ 1.1 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 3.40 % Note due in 2023 and the 3.75 % Note due in 2026. Abbott incurred a net charge of $ 153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps. Principal payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 are $ 7 million in 2021, $ 753 million in 2022, $ 2.4 billion in 2023, $ 1.3 billion in 2024, $ 1.5 billion in 2025 and $ 12.5 billion in 2026 and thereafter. At December 31, 2020, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was A by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A3 by Moody’s. Abbott’s weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings was 0.4 %at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. ​ Note 11 — Leases Leases where Abbott is the Lessee Abbott has entered into operating leases as the lessee for office space, manufacturing facilities, R&D laboratories, warehouses, vehicles and equipment. Finance leases are not significant. Abbott’s operating leases generally have remaining lease terms of 1 to 10 years . Some leases include options to extend beyond the original lease term , generally up to 10 years and some include options to terminate early . These options have been included in the determination of the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. For all of its asset classes, Abbott elected the practical expedient allowed under FASB ASC No. 842, “Leases” to account for each lease component (e.g., the right to use office space) and the associated non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services) as a single lease component. Abbott also elected the short-term lease accounting policy for all asset classes; therefore, Abbott is not recognizing a lease liability or right of use (ROU) asset for any lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that Abbott is reasonably certain to exercise. As Abbott’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the interest rate used to determine the present value of the payments under each lease typically reflects Abbott’s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. Abbott’s incremental borrowing rates at January 1, 2019 were used for operating leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019 when ASC 842 was adopted. ​ 64 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11 — Leases (Continued) The following table provides information related to Abbott’s operating leases: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions, except weighted averages) 2020 2019 ​ Operating lease cost (a) ​ $ 329 ​ $ 314 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities ​ ​ 264 ​ ​ 253 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ROU assets arising from entering into new operating lease obligations ​ ​ 396 ​ ​ 310 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted average remaining lease term at December 31 (in years) ​ ​ 8 ​ ​ 8 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted average discount rate at December 31 ​ ​ 3.2 % ​ 3.9 % Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2020 were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ 2021 ​ $ 272 2022 ​ 228 2023 ​ 177 2024 ​ 131 2025 ​ 100 Thereafter ​ 407 Total future minimum lease payments – undiscounted ​ 1,315 Less: imputed interest ​ ( 172 ) Present value of lease liabilities ​ $ 1,143 ​ The following table summarizes the amounts and location of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Balance Sheet Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Lease - ROU Asset ​ $ 1,101 ​ $ 934 ​ Deferred income taxes and other assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Lease Liability: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Current ​ $ 241 ​ $ 205 ​ Other accrued liabilities Non-current ​ 902 ​ ​ 755 ​ Post-employment obligations and other long-term liabilities Total Liability ​ $ 1,143 ​ $ 960 ​ ​ 65 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11 — Leases (Continued) Leases where Abbott is the Lessor Certain assets, primarily diagnostics instruments, are leased to customers under contractual arrangements that typically include an operating or sales-type lease as well as performance obligations for reagents and other consumables. Sales-type leases are not significant. Contract terms vary by customer and may include options to terminate the contract or options to extend the contract. Where instruments are provided under operating lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g., reagent) sales. The allocation of revenue between the lease and non-lease components is based on stand-alone selling prices. Operating lease revenue represented less than 3 percent of Abbott’s total net sales in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Assets related to operating leases are reported within Net property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $ 3.3 billion and $ 1.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and $ 2.8 billion and $ 1.2 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. ​ Note 12 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 8.1 billion at December 31, 2020, and $ 6.8 billion at December 31, 2019, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2020 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Abbott held gross notional amounts of $ 11.0 billion and $ 9.1 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. In November 2019, Abbott borrowed ¥ 59.8 billion under a 5 -year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The proceeds equated to approximately $ 550 million. The value of this long-term debt was approximately $ 577 million and $ 546 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. In October 2018, Abbott unwound approximately $ 1.1 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 3.40 % Note due in 2023 and the 3.75 % Note due in 2026. As a part of the unwinding, Abbott paid approximately $ 90 million in cash, which was included in the Financing Activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in 2018. ​ 66 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 12 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of December 31: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value — Assets ​ Fair Value — Liabilities (in millions) 2020 2019 Balance Sheet Caption 2020 2019 Balance Sheet Caption Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ ​ $ 210 ​ $ 48 Deferred income taxes and other assets ​ $ — ​ $ — Post-employment obligations and other long-term liabilities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Hedging instruments ​ ​ 30 ​ 110 Other prepaid expenses and receivables ​ 433 ​ 56 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges ​ ​ 60 ​ 38 ​ Other prepaid expenses and receivables ​ 65 ​ 33 ​ Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ n/a ​ ​ 577 ​ ​ 546 ​ Long-term debt ​ ​ ​ $ 300 ​ $ 196 ​ ​ ​ $ 1,075 ​ $ 635 ​ ​ ​ The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gain (loss) Recognized in ​ Income (expense) and ​ ​ ​ ​ Other Comprehensive ​ Gain (loss) Reclassified ​ ​ ​ ​ Income (loss) ​ into Income ​ ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Income Statement Caption Foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges ​ $ ( 207 ) ​ $ 9 ​ $ 73 ​ $ 102 ​ $ 79 ​ $ ( 114 ) ​ Cost of products sold Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ ( 31 ) ​ 4 ​ — ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ n/a n/a Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ 162 ​ 148 ​ ( 97 ) Interest expense ​ A loss of $ 171 million, a gain of $ 75 million and a loss of $ 100 million were recognized in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as hedges. These amounts are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line. The interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The hedged debt is marked to market, offsetting the effect of marking the interest rate swaps to market. ​ 67 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 12 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of December 31 are shown in the table below.

The fair value of the debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. Contingent consideration relates to businesses acquired by Abbott. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on an independent appraisal adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. The maximum amount for certain contingent consideration is not determinable as it is based on a percent of certain sales. Excluding such contingent consideration, the maximum amount estimated to be due is approximately $ 200 million, which is dependent upon attaining certain sales thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events, such as regulatory approvals. 69 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13 — Litigation and Environmental Matters Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 90 million to $ 120 million. The recorded accrual balance at December 31, 2020 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 105 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ​ Note 14 — Post-Employment Benefits Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution and medical and dental plans.

The projected benefit obligations for non-U.S. defined benefit plans were $ 4.1 billion and $ 3.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligations for all defined benefit plans were $ 11.9 billion and $ 10.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For plans where the projected benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the projected benefit obligations and the aggregate plan assets were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 Projected benefit obligation ​ $ 8,946 ​ $ 7,585 Fair value of plan assets ​ 7,010 ​ 5,936 ​ For plans where the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligations, the projected benefit obligations and the aggregate plan assets were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 Accumulated benefit obligation ​ $ 2,459 ​ $ 1,985 Projected benefit obligation ​ 2,773 ​ 2,266 Fair value of plan assets ​ 965 ​ 821 ​ The components of the net periodic benefit cost were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical and ​ ​ ​ Defined Benefit Plans ​ Dental Plans (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Service cost — benefits earned during the year ​ ​ $ 336 ​ $ 250 ​ $ 293 ​ $ 46 ​ $ 23 ​ $ 26 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations ​ ​ 300 ​ 337 ​ 308 ​ 42 ​ 52 ​ 48 Expected return on plans' assets ​ ​ ( 770 ) ​ ( 710 ) ​ ( 680 ) ​ ( 28 ) ​ ( 27 ) ​ ( 33 ) Amortization of actuarial losses ​ ​ 255 ​ 132 ​ ​ 205 ​ ​ 21 ​ ​ 22 ​ ​ 33 Amortization of prior service cost (credits) ​ ​ ​ 1 ​ ​ 1 ​ ​ 1 ​ ​ ( 28 ) ​ ​ ( 32 ) ​ ​ ( 45 ) Total net cost ​ ​ $ 122 ​ $ 10 ​ $ 127 ​ $ 53 ​ $ 38 ​ $ 29 ​ Other comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year includes the amortization of actuarial losses and prior service costs (credits) as noted in the previous table.

The net actuarial losses in 2020 and 2019 are primarily due to the year-over-year decline in discount rates partially offset by the impact of actual asset returns in excess of expected returns in each of the period. ​ 71 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 2019 2018 Discount rate 2.3 % 3.0 % 4.0 % Expected aggregate average long-term change in compensation 4.3 % 4.3 % 4.3 % ​ The weighted average assumptions used to determine the net cost for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 2019 2018 Discount rate 3.0 % 4.0 % 3.4 % Expected return on plan assets 7.5 % 7.5 % 7.7 % Expected aggregate average long-term change in compensation 4.3 % 4.3 % 4.4 % ​ The assumed health care cost trend rates for medical and dental plans at December 31 were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 2019 2018 Health care cost trend rate assumed for the next year 8 % 9 % 9 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to 5 % 5 % 5 % Year that rate reaches the assumed ultimate rate 2025 ​ 2025 ​ 2025 ​ ​ The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are forward projections of health care costs as of the measurement date. ​ 72 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) The following table summarizes the bases used to measure the defined benefit and medical and dental plan assets at fair value: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Basis of Fair Value Measurement ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Quoted ​ Significant ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Prices in ​ Other ​ Significant ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding ​ Active ​ Observable ​ Unobservable ​ Measured at (in millions) Balances Markets Inputs Inputs NAV (j) December 31, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ U.S. large cap (a) ​ $ 3,410 ​ $ 2,202 ​ $ — ​ $ — ​ $ 1,208 U.S. mid and small cap (b) ​ ​ 775 ​ ​ 721 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 3 ​ ​ 51 International (c) ​ ​ 2,654 ​ ​ 542 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 2,112 Fixed income securities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ U.S. government securities (d) ​ ​ 475 ​ ​ 23 ​ ​ 289 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 163 Corporate debt instruments (e) ​ ​ 1,408 ​ ​ 425 ​ ​ 908 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 75 Non-U.S. government securities (f) ​ ​ 523 ​ ​ 16 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 507 Other (g) ​ ​ 503 ​ ​ 159 ​ ​ 72 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 272 Absolute return funds (h) ​ ​ 1,618 ​ ​ 462 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 1,156 Cash and Cash Equivalents ​ ​ 281 ​ ​ 77 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 204 Other (i) ​ ​ 724 ​ ​ 9 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 715 ​ ​ $ 12,371 ​ $ 4,636 ​ $ 1,269 ​ $ 3 ​ $ 6,463 December 31, 2019: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ U.S. large cap (a) ​ $ 2,873 ​ $ 1,647 ​ $ — ​ $ — ​ $ 1,226 U.S. mid and small cap (b) ​ 648 ​ ​ 548 ​ ​ 4 ​ ​ 2 ​ ​ 94 International (c) ​ 2,202 ​ ​ 464 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 1,738 Fixed income securities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ U.S. government securities (d) ​ 562 ​ ​ 52 ​ ​ 357 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 153 Corporate debt instruments (e) ​ 1,266 ​ ​ 362 ​ ​ 724 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 180 Non-U.S. government securities (f) ​ 445 ​ ​ 3 ​ ​ 2 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 440 Other (g) ​ 320 ​ ​ 69 ​ ​ 27 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 224 Absolute return funds (h) ​ 1,557 ​ ​ 424 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 1,133 Cash and Cash Equivalents ​ ​ 182 ​ ​ 84 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 98 Other (i) ​ 582 ​ ​ 8 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 1 ​ ​ 573 ​ ​ $ 10,637 ​ $ 3,661 ​ $ 1,114 ​ $ 3 ​ $ 5,859 73 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) Equities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. For approximately half of these funds, investments may be redeemed once per month, with a required 7 to 30 day notice period. For the remaining funds, daily redemption of an investment is allowed. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry recognized vendors. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to fixed income funds at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Fixed income securities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. For the majority of these funds, investments may be redeemed either weekly or monthly, with a required 2 to 14 day notice period. For the remaining funds, investments may be generally redeemed daily. Absolute return funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. All private funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund on a one-quarter lag adjusted for known cash flows and significant events through the reporting date. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to absolute return funds at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Investments in these funds may be generally redeemed monthly or quarterly with required notice periods ranging from 5 to 90 days . For approximately $ 245 million and $ 110 million of the absolute return funds, redemptions are subject to a 33 percent gate and a 25 percent gate, respectively, and $ 60 million is subject to a lock until 2022. Investments in the private funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2021 to 2030. Abbott’s unfunded commitment in these funds was $ 523 million and $ 579 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, as well as balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities with lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The plans do not directly hold any securities of Abbott. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plans’ assets. Abbott’s medical and dental plans’ assets are invested in a similar mix as the pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation percentages at year end are consistent with the company’s targeted asset allocation percentages. The plans’ expected return on assets, as shown above is based on management’s expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. Abbott funds its domestic pension plans according to IRS funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. Abbott funded $ 400 million in 2020 and $ 382 million in 2019 to defined pension plans. Abbott expects to contribute approximately $ 410 million to its pension plans in 2021. 74 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which includes payments funded from company assets, as well as paid from the plans, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined ​ Medical and (in millions) Benefit Plans Dental Plans 2021 ​ $ 340 ​ $ 72 2022 ​ ​ 355 ​ ​ 73 2023 ​ ​ 373 ​ ​ 74 2024 ​ ​ 395 ​ ​ 75 2025 ​ ​ 415 ​ ​ 76 2026 to 2030 ​ ​ 2,410 ​ ​ 394 ​ The Abbott Stock Retirement Plan is the principal defined contribution plan. Abbott’s contributions to this plan were $ 164 million in 2020, $ 158 million in 2019 and $ 146 million in 2018. The 2018 contributions include amounts related to participants of the St. Jude Medical Retirement Plan which was terminated in January 2018. ​ Note 15 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the annual effective rates, including charges for interest and penalties. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the recognition of approximately $ 170 million of tax benefits associated with the impairment of certain assets, approximately $ 140 million of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years, and approximately $ 100 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include a $ 26 million increase to the transition tax associated with the 2017 TCJA. The $ 26 million increase to the transition tax liability was the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. This adjustment increased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $ 1.53 billion. The one-time transition tax is based on Abbott’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 E&P considered held in cash and other specified assets. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining balance of Abbott’s transition tax obligation is approximately $ 805 million, which will be paid over the next six years as allowed by the TCJA. In 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included an $ 86 million reduction of the transition tax and $ 68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India. The $ 86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2019. In 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included $ 98 million of net tax expense related to the settlement of Abbott’s 2014-2016 federal income tax audit in the U.S., partial settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group’s 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in the U.S. and audit settlements in various countries. In 2018, Abbott also recorded $ 130 million of additional tax expense related to the TCJA; the $ 130 million reflected a $ 120 million increase in the transition tax from $ 2.89 billion to $ 3.01 billion and a $ 10 million reduction in the net benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled. There are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which are individually significant. Reserves for interest and penalties are not significant. 75 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued) Earnings from continuing operations before taxes, and the related provisions for taxes on earnings from continuing operations, were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Taxes: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Domestic ​ $ 1,588 ​ $ 889 ​ $ ( 430 ) Foreign ​ 3,380 ​ 3,188 ​ ​ 3,303 Total ​ $ 4,968 ​ $ 4,077 ​ $ 2,873 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Taxes on Earnings From Continuing Operations: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Current: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Domestic ​ $ 39 ​ $ 291 ​ $ ( 812 ) Foreign ​ 566 ​ 590 ​ ​ 606 Total current ​ 605 ​ 881 ​ ​ ( 206 ) Deferred: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Domestic ​ ( 18 ) ​ ( 305 ) ​ ​ 832 Foreign ​ ( 90 ) ​ ( 186 ) ​ ​ ( 87 ) Total deferred ​ ( 108 ) ​ ( 491 ) ​ ​ 745 Total ​ $ 497 ​ $ 390 ​ $ 539 ​ Differences between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2020 2019 2018 Statutory tax rate on earnings from continuing operations 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Impact of foreign operations ( 3.3 ) ​ ( 5.0 ) ​ ( 5.4 ) ​ Impact of TCJA and other related items ​ 0.5 ​ ( 2.1 ) ​ 6.3 ​ Foreign-derived intangible income benefit ​ ( 1.0 ) ​ ( 2.0 ) ​ ( 1.9 ) ​ Domestic impairment loss ​ ( 2.7 ) ​ — ​ ( 2.1 ) ​ Excess tax benefits related to stock compensation ​ ( 1.9 ) ​ ( 2.5 ) ​ ( 3.1 ) ​ Research tax credit ​ ( 1.0 ) ​ ( 1.2 ) ​ ( 1.8 ) ​ Resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years ( 2.8 ) ​ — ​ 3.4 ​ Intercompany restructurings and integration ​ 0.5 ​ — ​ — ​ State taxes, net of federal benefit 0.5 ​ 0.8 ​ 0.4 ​ All other, net 0.2 ​ 0.6 ​ 2.0 ​ Effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations 10.0 % 9.6 % 18.8 % ​ Impact of foreign operations is primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, Singapore, and Malta. ​ 76 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued) The tax effect of the differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Compensation and employee benefits $ 1,003 ​ $ 982 Other, primarily reserves not currently deductible, and NOL’s and credit carryforwards ​ ​ 2,383 ​ ​ 2,378 Trade receivable reserves ​ ​ 196 ​ ​ 190 Inventory reserves ​ ​ 146 ​ ​ 110 Lease liabilities ​ ​ 259 ​ ​ 209 Deferred intercompany profit ​ ​ 254 ​ ​ 259 Total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance ​ ​ 4,241 ​ ​ 4,128 Valuation allowance ​ ​ ( 1,060 ) ​ ​ ( 978 ) Total deferred tax assets ​ ​ 3,181 ​ ​ 3,150 Deferred tax liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Depreciation ​ ​ ( 297 ) ​ ​ ( 219 ) Right of Use lease assets ​ ​ ( 251 ) ​ ​ ( 209 ) Other, primarily the excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets ​ ​ ( 2,876 ) ​ ​ ( 3,258 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ​ ​ ( 3,424 ) ​ ​ ( 3,686 ) Total net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ ( 243 ) ​ $ ( 536 ) ​ Abbott has incurred losses in a foreign jurisdiction where realization of the future economic benefit is so remote that the benefit is not reflected as a deferred tax asset.

Abbott’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Abbott’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2020, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. Abbott’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 84. Robert B. Ford President and Chief Executive Officer Robert E. Funck, Jr. Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Philip P. Boudreau Vice President, Finance and Controller February 19, 2021 ​ 81 ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders’ investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 82 ​ Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. ​ ​ Income taxes – Unrecognized tax benefits Description of the Matter ​ As described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020. Unrecognized tax benefits are assessed by management quarterly for identification and measurement, or more frequently if there are any indicators suggesting change in unrecognized tax benefits. Assessing tax positions involves judgement including interpreting tax laws of multiple jurisdictions and assumptions relevant to the measurement of an unrecognized tax benefit, including the estimated amount of tax liability that may be incurred should the tax position not be sustained upon inspection by a tax authority. These judgements and assumptions can significantly affect unrecognized tax benefits. How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit ​ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s identification and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, as well as its process for the assessment of events that may indicate a change in unrecognized tax benefits is warranted. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the completeness of identified unrecognized tax benefits, as well as controls over management’s review of significant assumptions used within the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits. With the support of our tax professionals, among other audit procedures performed, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s judgement with respect to the interpretation of tax laws of multiple jurisdictions by reading and evaluating management’s documentation, including relevant accounting policies, and by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, affected management’s judgments. We tested the completeness of management’s assessment of the identification of unrecognized tax benefits and possible outcomes related to it including evaluation of technical merits of the unrecognized tax benefits. We also tested, with the support of our valuation specialists, appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and significant assumptions associated with the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, including assessing the estimated amount of tax liability that may be incurred should the tax position not be sustained upon inspection by a tax authority. ​ /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. Chicago, Illinois February 19, 2021 ​ 83 ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 19, 2021 ​ 84 ​ ITEM 9.

If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2017 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program. ​ ​ ​ ​ (iii) Abbott Laboratories Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees . Eligible employees of participating non-U.S. affiliates of Abbott may participate in this plan. An eligible employee may authorize payroll deductions at the rate of 1% to 10% of eligible compensation (in multiples of one percent) subject to a limit of US $12,500 during any purchase cycle. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Purchase cycles are generally six months long and usually begin on August 1 and February 1. On the last day of each purchase cycle, Abbott uses participant contributions to acquire Abbott common shares. The shares may be either authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares acquired on the open market. The purchase price is typically 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date or on the first day of that purchase cycle. As the number of shares subject to outstanding options is indeterminable, columns (a) and (b) of the above table do not include information on the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2020, an aggregate of 11,611,818 common shares were available for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, including shares subject to purchase during the current purchase cycle. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ In April 2017, the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees was amended and restated as the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees. ​ ​ ​ (2) ​ Not included in the table: St. Jude Medical, Inc. Plans . In 2017, in connection with the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc., options outstanding under the St. Jude Medical, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated (2014) were assumed by Abbott and converted into Abbott options of substantially equivalent value. As of December 31, 2020, 885,521 options remained outstanding under these plans. These options have a weighted average purchase price of $30.46. No further awards will be granted under these plans. ​ 87 ​ For additional information concerning the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program, the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program, and the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees, see the discussion in Note 9 entitled “Incentive Stock Program” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” (b) Information Concerning Security Ownership .

Abbott’s* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. On October 3, 2017, Abbott completed the acquisition of Alere Inc., a diagnostic device and service provider, for an aggregate consideration of approximately $4.5 billion in cash. On February 27, 2017, Abbott completed the sale of Abbott Medical Optics, its vision care business, to Johnson & Johnson for $4.325 billion in cash. On January 4, 2017, Abbott completed the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc., a global medical device manufacturer. Based on the closing Abbott share price on January 4, 2017, the aggregate implied value of the consideration paid in connection with the acquisition was approximately $23.6 billion, including approximately $13.6 billion in cash and approximately $10 billion in Abbott common shares. Established Pharmaceutical Products These products include a broad line of branded generic pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide and marketed and sold outside the United States in emerging markets. These products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with, or licensed from, other companies. The principal products included in the broad therapeutic area portfolios of the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment are: * As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the term “Abbott” refers to Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois corporation, or Abbott Laboratories and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires. ​ 1 The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment directs its primary marketing efforts toward building strong brands with key stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Government agencies are also important customers. Competition in the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is generally from other health care and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors may increase competitive pressures. Diagnostic Products These products include a broad line of diagnostic systems and tests manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, clinics, physicians’ offices, government agencies, alternate care testing sites, and plasma protein therapeutic companies from Abbott owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors. The principal products included in the Diagnostic Products segment are: The Diagnostic Products segment’s products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, instrument warranty provisions, product performance, laboratory efficiency, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. Nutritional Products These products include a broad line of pediatric and adult nutritional products manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to consumers and to institutions, wholesalers, retailers, health care facilities, government agencies, and third-party distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers or third-party distributors. The principal products included in the Nutritional Products segment are: 2 * These products are available with 2'‐FL HMO (Human Milk Oligosaccharide) in several markets. Primary marketing efforts for nutritional products are directed toward consumers or to securing the recommendation of Abbott’s brand of products by physicians or other health care professionals. In addition, certain nutritional products sold as Similac ® , Gain™, Grow™, Eleva™, PediaSure ® , PediaSure SideKicks ® , Pedialyte ® , Ensure ® , Zone Perfect ® , and Glucerna ® are also promoted directly to the public by consumer marketing efforts in select markets where appropriate. Competition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers’ products may increase competitive pressure. Medical Devices These products include a broad line of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care products for people with diabetes, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally marketed and sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, physicians’ offices, and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. The principal products included in the Medical Devices segment are: 3 These products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, product performance, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ABBOTT’S BUSINESS IN GENERAL Sources and Availability of Raw Materials Abbott purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to Abbott’s operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and around the world. There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies. Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses Abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products. Accordingly, where possible, patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for Abbott’s products in the United States and countries of interest to Abbott. Abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications. Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 through 4. These, and various patents which expire during the period 2020 to 2040, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Abbott’s business. Abbott believes that no single patent, license, or trademark is material in relation to Abbott’s business as a whole. Seasonal Aspects, Customers, Backlog, and Renegotiation There are no significant seasonal aspects to Abbott’s business. Abbott has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on Abbott. Orders for Abbott’s products are generally filled on a current basis, and order backlog is not material to Abbott’s business. No material portion of Abbott’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government. Environmental Matters Abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. Abbott’s capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2019 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2020. Abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which are owned by Abbott, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, Abbott believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Employees Abbott employed approximately 107,000 people as of December 31, 2019. 4 Regulation The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott’s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar international regulatory agencies. Government regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott’s products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott’s clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections. Abbott’s international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott’s investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products. Abbott’s laboratory facilities and home monitoring services, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to third-party payors. In the United States, Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria. Abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott’s business. Among other effects, health care regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Device Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions, including suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory’s certification, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties. Abbott’s business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in many countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. Abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products. Many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, or coverage limitations. Budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on Abbott’s products for the foreseeable future. In the United States, the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices, diagnostics, supplies, and other products, as well as the procedures in which these products may be used. The government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) 5 payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home, and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time. For example, Medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment (including diabetes products), enteral nutrition products, and supplies. Additionally, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act establishes a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests, which became effective on January 1, 2018. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), imposed an excise tax on Abbott and other medical device manufacturers and importers. The excise tax was suspended from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 and was repealed as of January 1, 2020 by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020. The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. In October 2018, the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required, beginning with reports filed in 2022. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. Policy changes or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to health care systems. In the United States, this could include potential modification or repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act. The regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information (including patient health information and financial information), is increasing. For example, the European Union, various other countries, and various U.S. states (e.g., California) have enacted stricter data protection laws that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information, and the FDA has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices. In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering “data localization” laws, which limit companies’ ability to transfer protected data across country borders. Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties. Transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended, and Abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area. Governmental cost containment efforts also affect Abbott’s nutritional products business. In the United States, for example, under regulations governing the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula. As a result, through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program. Abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture, quality assurance requirements, marketing authorization processes, post-market surveillance requirements, availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services, as well as data privacy and security. Abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing health care products or services to market, access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical, nutrition, diagnostic, and medical device industries, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. 6 INTERNET INFORMATION Copies of Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through Abbott’s investor relations website ( www.abbottinvestor.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after Abbott electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission).

Abbott’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott’s credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity. Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income. In the United States and other countries, Abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “Regulation.” To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. Abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, or diagnostic product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs. In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott’s products, and criminal prosecution. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott’s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott’s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability and financial condition. 8 Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. Abbott’s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott’s business. Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to our products’ coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott’s products or the prices that Abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them. Further, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services. These provisions may be modified, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law. For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s results of operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties. Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties. Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Any significant attack or other disruption on Abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business. 9 Abbott has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility. As of December 31, 2019, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $18 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Further, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition. Additionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility. The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott’s future revenues and operating income. Many of Abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott’s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott’s intellectual property rights, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “Legal Proceedings.” Competitors’ intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition. Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition. Abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested. Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott’s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under 10 development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer. New products and technological advances by Abbott’s competitors may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations. Abbott’s products face intense competition from its competitors’ products. Competitors’ products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott’s products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products. The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer. The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability. Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition. Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition. Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and Abbott’s ability to realize projected sales and earnings. Although Abbott’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2019 made up approximately 64 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott’s assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks. 11 Information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott’s financial results is contained in the “Financial Review — Results of Operations” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott’s 2019 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in this report. Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott’s customers depend on payment by government health care systems. The international nature of Abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. Abbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2019 made up approximately 64 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott’s international operations include: Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect Abbott’s profitability and its financial condition, including: 12 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, and projections. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” variations of these words, and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Certain factors, including but not limited to those identified under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, estimates, projections, forecasts, and from past results. No assurance can be made that any expectation, estimate, or projection contained in a forward-looking statement will be achieved or will not be affected by the factors cited above or other unknown or future events. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as the result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ​ 13 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2019, Abbott owned or leased properties totaling approximately 42 million square feet, of which approximately 70% is owned by Abbott. Abbott’s principal corporate offices are located in Illinois and are owned by Abbott. Abbott operates 92 manufacturing facilities globally. Abbott’s facilities are deemed suitable and provide adequate productive capacity. The manufacturing facilities are used by Abbott’s reportable segments as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Manufacturing Reportable Segments ​ Sites Medical Devices 27 Diagnostic Products 23 Established Pharmaceutical Products 28 Nutritional Products 14 Worldwide Total 92 ​ Abbott’s research and development facilities in the United States are primarily located in California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Ohio. Abbott also has research and development facilities in various other countries, including China, Colombia, India, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. There are no material encumbrances on the properties. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Abbott is involved in various claims, legal proceedings and investigations. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ​ 14 INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Executive officers of Abbott are elected annually by the board of directors.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. Sales in international markets comprise approximately 64 percent of consolidated net sales. Over the last several years, Abbott proactively shaped the company with the strategic intent to deliver sustainable growth in all of its businesses. Significant steps over the last three years included: The increase in total sales over the last three years reflects both volume growth across Abbott’s businesses and the 2017 acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere. Volume growth reflects the introduction of new products as well as higher sales of existing products. Sales in emerging markets, which represent approximately 40 percent of total company sales, increased 8.2 percent in 2019 and 12.3 percent in 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. (Emerging markets include all countries except the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.) Over the last three years, Abbott’s operating margin was positively impacted by margin improvements in various businesses, including Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diabetes Care, Rapid Diagnostics, and Structural Heart. A reduction in the costs associated with the recent business acquisitions also drove the improvement in operating margins from 2017 to 2019. In 2019, Abbott’s operating margin increased by approximately 2 percentage points primarily due to lower intangible amortization expense and lower business integration and restructuring costs compared to 2018. In 2018, Abbott’s operating margin increased by approximately 6 percentage points primarily due to operating margin improvement in various businesses and lower inventory step-up amortization and integration costs associated with the acquisitions. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, the results of the Diabetes Care business, which had previously been included in the non-reportable segment category, were aggregated with the results of the businesses in the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation segment to comprise the Medical Devices reportable segment. Historic periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the Medical Devices segment increased 10.5 percent in 2019 and 9.0 percent in 2018. The sales increase in 2019 was driven primarily by higher Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure sales. The sales increase in 2018 was driven primarily by higher Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, and Neuromodulation sales. In 2019, operating earnings for this segment increased 7.7 percent. The operating margin profile increased from 29.2 percent of sales in 2017 to 30.8 percent in 2019 primarily due to sales volume growth and various cost improvement initiatives, partially offset by investment spending to drive the growth of new products. 20 In 2019, in the Medical Devices segment, product approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) included: In March 2019, Abbott announced new data from its MOMENTUM 3 clinical study, the largest randomized controlled trial to assess outcomes in patients receiving a heart pump to treat advanced heart failure, which demonstrated Abbott's HeartMate 3 ® Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) improved survival and clinical outcomes in this patient population. In October 2018, the FDA approved HeartMate 3 as a destination (long-term use) therapy for patients living with advanced heart failure. In December 2019, Abbott received CE Mark approval in Europe for its next-generation high-voltage implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices. In January 2020, Abbott received CE Mark approval in Europe for its Tendyne Transcatheter Mitral Valve Implantation system for the treatment of significant MR in patients requiring a heart valve replacement who are not candidates for open-heart surgery or transcatheter mitral valve repair. In Abbott’s worldwide diagnostics business, sales growth over the last three years reflected the acquisition of Alere in October 2017, as well as continued market penetration by the core laboratory business in the U.S. and internationally. Alere’s results are included in Abbott’s Diagnostic Products reportable segment from the date of acquisition. Worldwide diagnostic sales increased 5.9 percent in 2019 and 33.6 percent in 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of the Alere acquisition, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the Diagnostic Products segment increased 6.5 percent in 2018. The 2019 and 2018 growth includes the continued adoption by customers of Alinity ® , which is Abbott’s integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems and solutions that are designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space, generating test results faster and minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results. Abbott has regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, China, and other markets for the “Alinity c” and “Alinity i” instruments and multiple assays for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics, respectively. Abbott has obtained regulatory approval for the “Alinity h” instrument for hematology in Europe and Japan. In 2019, Abbott continued the roll-out in Europe of its “Alinity s” blood and plasma screening system and received U.S. FDA approval for “Alinity s” and several testing assays. In 2019, Abbott also announced that it had obtained CE Mark for its “Alinity m” (molecular) diagnostics system and several testing assays. In 2019, operating earnings for the Diagnostics segment increased 2.3 percent. The operating margin profile decreased from 26.1 percent of sales in 2017 to 24.8 percent in 2019 primarily due to dilution from the acquisition of Alere, the negative impact of foreign exchange, and costs to accelerate the roll-out of Alinity, partially offset by the continued focus on cost improvement. 21 In Abbott’s worldwide nutritional products business, sales over the last three years were positively impacted by numerous new product introductions, including the roll-out of HMO in infant formula, that leveraged Abbott’s strong brands. Sales were also positively affected by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets. In 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total adult nutrition sales increased 6.6 percent led by the continued growth of Ensure ® , Abbott’s market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna ® , Abbott’s market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand, across several countries, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the discontinuation of a non-core product line in the U.S. In 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total pediatric nutrition sales increased 3.4 percent driven by the PediaSure ® and Pedialyte ® brands in the U.S. as well as infant and toddler product growth across several markets in Asia and Latin America, partially offset by challenging conditions in the Greater China market. In 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the nutritional business experienced above-market growth in the worldwide pediatric business driven by the Similac ® and Pedialyte brands in the U.S. as well as growth across several markets in Asia. Worldwide, adult nutrition sales increased in 2018 led by the growth of Ensure and Glucerna. The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Established Pharmaceutical sales increased 7.3 percent in 2019 and 7.0 percent in 2018. The sales increase in 2019 was driven by growth in several geographies including China, Brazil, Russia and India. The sales increase in 2018 was driven by double-digit growth in India and China. Operating margins increased from 19.8 percent of sales in 2017 to 20.1 percent in 2019 primarily due to the continued focus on cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. In conjunction with the funding of the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions and the assumption of St. Jude Medical’s and Alere’s existing debt, Abbott’s total short-term and long-term debt increased from approximately $9.0 billion at December 31, 2015 to $27.9 billion at December 31, 2017. In 2018, Abbott repaid approximately $8.3 billion of debt, net of borrowings, bringing its total debt to $19.6 billion at December 31, 2018. In 2019, Abbott repaid approximately $1.6 billion of debt, net of borrowings, bringing its total debt to $18.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Abbott declared dividends of $1.32 per share in 2019 compared to $1.16 per share in 2018, an increase of approximately 14 percent. Dividends paid totaled $2.270 billion in 2019 compared to $1.974 billion in 2018. The year-over-year change in the amount of dividends paid primarily reflects the increase in the dividend rate. In December 2019, Abbott increased the company’s quarterly dividend by approximately 12.5 percent to $0.36 per share from $0.32 per share, effective with the dividend paid in February 2020. In 2020, Abbott will focus on continuing to invest in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth over the next several years. In its diagnostics business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving market adoption and geographic expansion of its Alinity suite of diagnostics instruments. In the medical devices business, Abbott will continue to focus on expanding its market position in various areas including diabetes care, structural heart, electrophysiology, and heart failure. In its nutritionals business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving growth globally and further enhancing its portfolio with the introduction of several new science-based products. In the established pharmaceuticals business, Abbott will continue to focus on growing its business with the depth and breadth of its portfolio in emerging markets. 22 Critical Accounting Policies Sales Rebates — In 2019, approximately 44 percent of Abbott’s consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances in 2019 are in the Nutritional Products and Diabetes Care businesses. Abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2019, 2018 and 2017 amounted to approximately $3.1 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, or 19.1 percent, 19.0 percent and 20.5 percent of gross sales, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $16.3 billion, $16.0 billion and $13.9 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one-percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $163 million in 2019. Abbott considers a one-percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $169 million, $175 million and $166 million for cash discounts in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $192 million, $191 million and $204 million for returns in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott’s historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals. In the WIC business, estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott holds the WIC contract. The state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price, is reliably determinable. Rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years. Except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the states submitting rebate claims. The USDA, which administers the WIC program, has been making its data available for many years. Management also estimates the states' processing lag time based on sales and claims data. Inventory in the retail distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management has access to several large customers' inventory management data, which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel. At December 31, 2019, Abbott had WIC business in 26 states. Historically, adjustments to prior years’ rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. Income Taxes — Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items is often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. In accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2015 and the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. 23 Pension and Post-Employment Benefits — Abbott offers pension benefits and post-employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for years, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. Low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 2019, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for Abbott’s defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of $4.1 billion and $434 million, respectively. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post-employment benefits. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five-year period. Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one-percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate; however, there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point. Valuation of Intangible Assets — Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott’s critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. At December 31, 2019, goodwill amounted to $23.2 billion and net intangibles amounted to $17.0 billion. Amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $1.9 billion in 2019, $2.2 billion in 2018 and $2.0 billion in 2017. There was no significant reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2019, 2018 and 2017. Litigation — Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $95 million to $130 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Accruals of approximately $110 million have been recorded at December 31, 2019 for these proceedings and exposures. These accruals represent management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” 24 Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last two years: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Components of % Change ​ ​ Business ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ Acquisitions/ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ % Change Divestitures ​ Price ​ Volume ​ Exchange Total Net Sales 2019 vs. 2018 4.3 — 0.2 7.3 (3.2) 2018 vs. 2017 11.6 4.9 (1.0) 8.1 (0.4) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total U.S. 2019 vs. 2018 5.2 — (0.4) 5.6 — 2018 vs. 2017 12.1 8.0 (1.1) 5.2 — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total International 2019 vs. 2018 3.9 — 0.5 8.3 (4.9) 2018 vs. 2017 11.4 3.2 (1.0) 9.7 (0.5) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Established Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2019 vs. 2018 1.4 — 3.0 4.3 (5.9) 2018 vs. 2017 3.2 — 2.2 4.8 (3.8) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritional Products Segment 2019 vs. 2018 2.5 — 0.9 3.9 (2.3) 2018 vs. 2017 4.4 — 0.2 4.7 (0.5) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostic Products Segment 2019 vs. 2018 2.9 — (0.5) 6.4 (3.0) 2018 vs. 2017 33.5 27.1 (2.0) 8.5 (0.1) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices Segment 2019 vs. 2018 7.6 — (0.9) 11.4 (2.9) 2018 vs. 2017 10.1 — (2.7) 11.7 1.1 Note: Diabetes Care sales, which had previously been reported in Other, are now included in the Medical Devices segment. Historic periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. The increase in Total Net Sales in 2019 reflects volume growth across all of Abbott’s segments. The increase in Total Net Sales in 2018 reflects the acquisition of Alere, as well as volume growth across all of Abbott’s segments. The price declines related to the Medical Devices segment in 2019 and 2018 primarily reflect pricing pressures on drug eluting stents (DES) as a result of market competition in the U.S. and other major markets. 25 A comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows.

Historic periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. In order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates, current year U.S. dollar sales are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates. Total Established Pharmaceutical Products sales increased 7.3 percent in 2019 and 7.0 percent in 2018, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is focused on several key emerging markets including India, Russia, China and Brazil. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total sales in these key emerging markets increased 7.9 percent in 2019 due to growth in several geographies including China, Brazil, Russia and India. In 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total sales in these key emerging markets increased 7.4 percent as sales in India and China experienced double-digit growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales in Established Pharmaceuticals’ other emerging markets increased 5.6 percent in 2019 and 5.8 percent in 2018. Total Nutritional Products sales increased 4.8 percent in 2019 and 4.9 percent in 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In 2019, the 4.6 percent increase in International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by growth across Abbott’s portfolio, including Similac and PediaSure in various countries in Asia and Latin America and Pedialyte in Latin America. This growth was partially offset by challenging market dynamics in the Greater China infant category. The 7.2 percent increase in 2018 International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven primarily by growth in Asia and Latin America. In the U.S. Pediatric Nutritional business, the 1.9 percent increase in 2019 sales reflects growth in Pedialyte and PediaSure. 2018 U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales increased 3.7 percent primarily due to above-market performance in Abbott’s infant and toddler brands, including Similac and Pedialyte. 27 In the International Adult Nutritional business, the 10.9 percent increase in 2019 sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects continued growth of Ensure, Abbott’s market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna, Abbott’s market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand in several countries. In 2018, the 8.0 percent sales increase in the International Adult Nutritional business, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was led by growth of Ensure and Glucerna in Asia and Latin America. In 2019, U.S. Adult Nutritional sales were unchanged from 2018 due to the impact of Abbott’s discontinuation of a non-core product line during the third quarter of 2018 that was offset by growth in other areas of the business. In 2018, the 1.7 percent decrease in U.S. Adult Nutritional was also primarily driven by the wind down of this non-core product line. Total Diagnostic Products sales increased 5.9 percent in 2019 and 33.6 percent in 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The sales increase in 2019 was driven by above-market growth in Core Laboratory in the U.S. and internationally, where Abbott is achieving continued adoption of its Alinity family of diagnostic instruments. In July 2019, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for its “Alinity s” blood and plasma screening system and several testing assays. The 6.3 percent decrease in 2019 Molecular sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects the negative impact of lower non-governmental organization purchases in Africa. In March 2019, Abbott announced that it obtained CE Mark for its “Alinity m” molecular diagnostics system and several testing assays. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales growth in 2019 in various areas, including infectious disease testing in developed markets and cardio-metabolic testing, was mostly offset by lower than expected infectious disease testing sales in Africa. In 2018, the increase in total Diagnostic Products sales included the acquisition of Alere, which was completed on October 3, 2017. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the Diagnostic Products segment in 2018 increased 6.5 percent. The 2018 increase in sales was primarily driven by above-market growth in Core Laboratory in the U.S. and internationally. In 2018, Abbott accelerated the roll out of its Alinity systems for Core Laboratory in Europe. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 10.5 percent and 9.0 percent in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2019 sales increase was driven by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure. The 2018 sales increase was driven by growth in several areas, including double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Electrophysiology and Structural Heart. The 2019 and 2018 growth in Diabetes Care revenue was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre, Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, internationally and in the U.S. In 2019, Freestyle Libre sales totaled $1.842 billion, which reflected a 69.8 percent increase over 2018 sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In July 2018, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval of its FreeStyle Libre 14 day sensor, making it the longest lasting wearable glucose sensor available. In October 2018, Abbott obtained CE Mark for its Freestyle Libre 2 system, a next-generation product offering with optional real-time alarms. The 2019 growth in Structural Heart revenue was broad-based across several areas of the business, including MitraClip, Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR), a leaky heart valve. During the first quarter of 2019, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for a new, expanded indication for MitraClip to treat clinically significant secondary MR as a result of underlying heart failure. This new indication expands the number of people with MR that can be treated with the MitraClip device. In July 2019, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval of the next generation of its MitraClip device, which includes a new leaflet grasping enhancement, an expanded range of clip sizes and facilitation of procedure assessment in real time to offer doctors further options when treating mitral valve disease. In 2018, growth in Structural Heart was driven by several product areas including MitraClip and the AMPLATZER ® PFO occluder, a device designed to close a hole-like opening in the heart. In September 2018, Abbott announced positive clinical results from its COAPT study, which demonstrated that MitraClip improved survival and clinical outcomes for select patients with functional MR. In September 2019, Abbott announced additional data from its COAPT trial that shows that MitraClip is projected to increase life expectancy and quality of life compared to guideline-directed medical therapy alone in heart failure patients with secondary MR. In 2019, the growth in Electrophysiology revenue reflects higher sales of cardiac diagnostic and ablation catheters in both the U.S. and internationally. In January 2019, Abbott announced U.S. FDA approval of its TactiCath ® contact force ablation catheter, Sensor Enabled™, which is designed to help physicians treat atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular heartbeat. In 2018, the growth in Electrophysiology was led by higher sales in cardiac mapping and ablation catheters. In May 2018, Abbott announced U.S. FDA clearance of the Advisor HD Grid Mapping Catheter, Sensor Enabled, which creates detailed maps of the heart and expands Abbott's electrophysiology product portfolio. 28 In 2019, the growth in Heart Failure revenue was driven by rapid market adoption in the U.S. of Abbott's HeartMate 3 ® Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) following FDA approval in October 2018 as a destination (long-term use) therapy for people living with advanced heart failure as well as higher sales of Abbott’s CardioMEMS ® heart failure monitoring system. In March 2019, Abbott announced new data from its MOMENTUM 3 clinical study, the largest randomized controlled trial to assess outcomes in patients receiving a heart pump to treat advanced heart failure, which demonstrated HeartMate 3 improved survival and clinical outcomes in this patient population. In 2018, growth in international Heart Failure sales was offset by lower U.S. sales. In Vascular, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, sales in 2019 were flat as the 1.3 percent increase in coronary and endovascular product sales, which includes drug-eluting stents, balloon catheters, guidewires, vascular imaging/diagnostics products, vessel closure, carotid and other coronary and peripheral products, was offset by reductions in royalty and contract manufacturing revenue. In 2018, growth in Vascular imaging, vessel closure and other endovascular revenues was partially offset by lower DES sales due to lower U.S. market share and price erosion in various markets. During the second quarter of 2018, Abbott received approval from the U.S. FDA for the XIENCE Sierra Drug Eluting Stent System, the newest generation of its coronary stent system. During the second quarter of 2018, the XIENCE Sierra Drug Eluting Stent System also received national reimbursement in Japan to treat people with coronary artery disease. In Rhythm Management, higher 2019 international sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, were offset by a 4.4 percent decrease in U.S. revenue. In 2018, market share gains in the new patient segment for Rhythm Management and the U.S. launch of Abbott’s Confirm Rx ® Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM), the world’s first and only smartphone-compatible ICM designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias, were partially offset by replacement cycle dynamics. In 2019, the 2.4 percent decline in Neuromodulation sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects a 4.2 percent decline in U.S. sales. In 2018, the growth in Neuromodulation reflects higher revenue for various products for the treatment of chronic pain and movement disorders. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non-strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbott’s revenue recognition policies as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were not significant in 2019, 2018 and 2017. The expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. There are no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to materially affect Abbott. In April 2017, Abbott received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA related to its manufacturing facility in Sylmar, CA which was acquired by Abbott on January 4, 2017 as part of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. This facility manufactures implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, and monitors. The warning letter relates to the FDA’s observations from an inspection of this facility. Abbott has prepared a comprehensive plan of corrective actions which has been provided to the FDA. Abbott is continuing to execute the corrective actions in the plan. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 52.5 percent of net sales in 2019, 51.3 percent in 2018 and 47.5 percent in 2017. In 2019, the increase primarily reflects lower intangible amortization expense and lower integration and restructuring costs. In 2018, the increase primarily reflects lower inventory step-up amortization related to the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions and margin improvements in various businesses. Research and development (R&D) expense was $2.4 billion in 2019, $2.3 billion in 2018, and $2.3 billion in 2017 and represented a 6.1 percent increase in 2019, and a 1.7 percent increase in 2018. The increase in R&D spending in 2019 primarily reflects higher spending on the acquisition of R&D assets which were immediately expensed. In 2019, spending on R&D assets totaled $116 million and included the acquisition of an R&D asset valued at $102 million that was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc. In 2018, Abbott acquired R&D assets valued at $47 million which were also immediately expensed. The 2019 increase in R&D expense was also driven by higher R&D spending in various businesses, primarily in Medical Devices, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange. The 2018 increase in R&D expenses was primarily due to higher spending on various projects, partially offset by lower restructuring and integration costs. In 2019, R&D expenditures totaled $1.2 billion for the Medical Devices segment, $553 million for the Diagnostic Products segment, $193 million for the Nutritional Products segment and $185 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. 29 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were basically flat in 2019 and increased 6.1 percent in 2018 versus the respective prior year. In 2019, the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower acquisition-related integration costs offset higher selling and marketing costs to drive continued growth across various businesses. The 2018 increase was primarily due to the impact of the acquisition of the Alere business in October 2017, as well as higher spending to drive continued growth and market expansion in various businesses, partially offset by lower acquisition-related expenses. Business Acquisitions On January 4, 2017, Abbott completed the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, a global medical device manufacturer, for approximately $23.6 billion, including approximately $13.6 billion in cash and approximately $10 billion in Abbott common shares, which represented approximately 254 million shares of Abbott common stock, based on Abbott’s closing stock price on the acquisition date. The cash portion of the acquisition was funded through a combination of medium and long-term debt issued in November 2016 and a $2.0 billion 120-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility which was subsequently repaid. As part of the acquisition, approximately $5.9 billion of St. Jude Medical’s debt was assumed, repaid or refinanced by Abbott. The acquisition provides expanded opportunities for future growth and is an important part of the company's ongoing effort to develop a strong, diverse portfolio of devices, diagnostics, nutritionals and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The combined business competes in nearly every area of the cardiovascular device market, as well as in the neuromodulation market. In 2016, Abbott and St. Jude Medical agreed to sell certain businesses to Terumo Corporation for approximately $1.12 billion. The sale included the St. Jude Medical Angio-Seal™ and Femoseal™ vascular closure and Abbott’s Vado ® Steerable Sheath businesses. The sale closed on January 20, 2017 and no gain or loss was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. On October 3, 2017, Abbott acquired Alere, a diagnostic device and service provider, for $51.00 per common share in cash, which equated to a purchase price of approximately $4.5 billion. As part of the acquisition, Abbott tendered for Alere’s preferred shares for a total value of approximately $0.7 billion. In addition, approximately $3.0 billion of Alere’s debt was assumed and subsequently repaid. The acquisition establishes Abbott as a leader in point of care testing, expands Abbott’s global diagnostics presence and provides access to new products, channels and geographies. Abbott utilized a combination of cash on hand and debt to fund the acquisition. See Note 11 — Debt and Lines of Credit for further details regarding the debt utilized for the acquisition. In the third quarter of 2017, Alere entered into agreements to sell its Triage MeterPro cardiovascular and toxicology business and the assets and liabilities related to its B-type Natriuretic Peptide assay business run on Beckman Coulter analyzers to Quidel Corporation (Quidel). The transactions with Quidel reflect a total purchase price of $400 million payable at the close of the transaction, $240 million payable in six annual installments beginning approximately six months after the close of the transaction, and contingent consideration with a maximum value of $40 million. In the third quarter of 2017, Alere entered into an agreement with Siemens Diagnostics Holding II B.V. (Siemens) to sell its subsidiary, Epocal Inc., for approximately $200 million payable at the close of the transaction. Alere agreed to divest these businesses in connection with the review by the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission of Abbott’s agreement to acquire Alere. The sale to Quidel closed on October 6, 2017, and the sale to Siemens closed on October 31, 2017. No gain or loss on these sales was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. On July 17, 2017, Abbott commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash the 1.77 million outstanding shares of Alere’s Series B Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock at a price of $402 per share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends to, but not including, the settlement date of the tender offer. This tender offer was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including Abbott’s acquisition of Alere and upon there being validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn) at the expiration date of the tender offer that number of shares of Preferred Stock that equaled at least a majority of the Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the expiration of the tender offer. All conditions to the offer were satisfied and Abbott accepted for payment the 1.748 million shares of Preferred Stock that were validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn). The remaining shares were cashed out for an amount equal to the $400.00 per share liquidation preference of such shares, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, without interest. Payment for all of the shares of Preferred Stock was made in the fourth quarter of 2017. 30 Restructurings From 2017 to 2019, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $72 million in 2019, $52 million in 2018 and $187 million in 2017. Approximately $19 million in 2019, $5 million in 2018 and $5 million in 2017 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $4 million in 2019 and $10 million in 2018 are recorded in Research and development, and approximately $49 million in 2019, $37 million in 2018 and $182 million in 2017 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Abbott also assumed restructuring liabilities of approximately $23 million as part of the St Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions. From 2016 to 2019, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $66 million in 2019, $28 million in 2018 and $120 million in 2017. Approximately $16 million in 2019, $10 million in 2018 and $7 million in 2017 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $28 million in 2019, $2 million in 2018 and $77 million in 2017 are recorded in Research and development, and approximately $22 million in 2019, $16 million in 2018 and $36 million in 2017 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Additional charges of approximately $2 million in 2017 were recorded, primarily for accelerated depreciation. Interest Expense and Interest (Income) Interest expense decreased $156 million in 2019 due to the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in September 2018, as well as the repayment of debt in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. In 2018, interest expense decreased primarily due to the net repayment of $8.3 billion of debt, partially offset by lower interest income due to lower cash balances. In 2017, interest expense increased primarily due to the $15.1 billion of debt issued in November of 2016 related to the financing of the St. Jude Medical acquisition which closed on January 4, 2017. Debt Extinguishment Costs On December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.9% Notes due 2021. Abbott incurred a charge of $63 million related to the early repayment of this debt. On October 28, 2018, Abbott redeemed approximately $4 billion of debt, which included $750 million principal amount of its 2.00% Notes due 2020; $597 million principal amount of its 4.125% Notes due 2020; $900 million principal amount of its 3.25% Notes due 2023; $450 million principal amount of its 3.4% Notes due 2023; and $1.300 billion principal amount of its 3.75% Notes due 2026. Abbott incurred a net charge of $153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps. On March 22, 2018, Abbott redeemed all of the $947 million principal amount of its 5.125% Notes due 2019, as well as $1.055 billion of the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.35% Notes due 2019. Abbott incurred a net charge of $14 million related to the early repayment of this debt. Other (Income) Expense, net Other (income) expense, net, for 2019, 2018 and 2017 includes approximately $225 million, $160 million, and $160 million of income in each year, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. 2017 includes a pre-tax gain of $1.163 billion on the sale of AMO to Johnson & Johnson. Taxes on Earnings The income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 9.6 percent in 2019, 18.8 percent in 2018 and 84.2 percent in 2017. 31 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2018, Abbott completed its accounting for all of the enactment date income tax effects of the TCJA. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, the TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. In January 2018, the FASB staff provided guidance that an entity may make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes related to items that will give rise to GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year that the tax is incurred. Abbott has elected to treat the GILTI tax as a period expense and provide for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Abbott recorded an estimate of net tax expense of $1.46 billion for the impact of the TCJA, which was included in Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The estimate was provisional and included a charge of approximately $2.89 billion for the transition tax, partially offset by a net benefit of approximately $1.42 billion for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a net benefit of approximately $10 million related to certain other impacts of the TCJA. In 2018, Abbott recorded $130 million of additional tax expense which increased the final tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.59 billion. The $130 million of additional tax expense reflects a $120 million increase in the transition tax from $2.89 billion to $3.01 billion and a $10 million reduction in the net benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include an $86 million reduction to the transition tax. The $86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2019. This adjustment decreased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.50 billion. The one-time transition tax is based on Abbott’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 E&P considered held in cash and other specified assets. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining balance of Abbott’s transition tax obligation is approximately $1.33 billion, which will be paid over the next seven years as allowed by the TCJA. In 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included $68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India. In 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included $98 million of net tax expense related to the settlement of Abbott’s 2014-2016 federal income tax audit in the U.S., partial settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group’s 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in the U.S. and audit settlements in various countries. In 2017, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include $435 million of tax expense related to the gain on the sale of the AMO business. Exclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, and Singapore. Abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules, tax rulings, grants, and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate. Discontinued Operations Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax of $34 million and $124 million, in 2018 and 2017, respectively, were driven primarily by the recognition of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions pertaining to AbbVie’s operations for years prior to the separation. On January 1, 2013, Abbott completed the separation of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie), which was formed to hold Abbott’s research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business. Abbott has retained all liabilities for all U.S. federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation, as well as certain non-income taxes attributable to AbbVie’s business. AbbVie generally will be liable for all other taxes attributable to its business. 32 Business Disposition In September 2016, Abbott announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), its vision care business, to Johnson & Johnson for $4.325 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for cash, debt and working capital. The decision to sell AMO reflected Abbott's proactive shaping of its portfolio in line with its strategic priorities. In February 2017, Abbott completed the sale of AMO to Johnson & Johnson and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.163 billion including working capital adjustments, which was reported in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in 2017. Abbott recorded an after-tax gain of $728 million in 2017 related to the sale of AMO. The operating results of AMO up to the date of sale continued to be included in Earnings from continuing operations as the business did not qualify for reporting as discontinued operations. For 2017, the AMO loss before taxes included in Abbott’s consolidated earnings was $18 million. Research and Development Programs Abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development. Research and Development Process In the Established Pharmaceuticals segment, the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment’s existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. As Established Pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity. Depending upon the product, the phases of development may include: The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations, new indications, or geographic expansion in specific countries, such as China. In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include: The regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions. In the U.S., the FDA classifies diagnostic products into classes (I, II, or III) and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval. While the Diagnostics segment has products in all three classes, the vast majority of its products are categorized as Class I or Class II. Submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for Class I products. Class II devices typically require pre-market notification to the FDA through a regulatory filing known as a 510(k) submission. Most Class III products are subject to the FDA’s Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. Other Class III products, such as those used to screen blood, require the submission and approval of a Biological License Application (BLA). 33 In the European Union (EU), diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process, which has been governed by the European In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive, depends upon the category, with certain product categories requiring review and approval by an independent company, known as a Notified Body, before the manufacturer can affix a CE mark to the product to declare conformity to the Directive. Other products only require a self-certification process. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) which replaces the existing directive in the EU for in vitro diagnostic products. The IVDR will apply after a five-year transition period and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. In the Medical Devices segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product’s safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications. Similar to the diagnostic products discussed above, in the U.S., medical devices are classified as Class I, II, or III. Most of Abbott’s medical device products are classified as Class II devices that follow the 510(k) regulatory process or Class III devices that are subject to the PMA process. In the EU, medical devices are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which has been governed by the European Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, varies by class. Each product must bear a CE mark to show compliance with the Directive. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) which replaces the existing directives in the EU for medical devices. The MDR will apply after a three to five-year (depending on product classification) transition period and imposes additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. Some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to CE marking of the device. For other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self-certify its ability to apply the CE mark to the product. Outside the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions. After approval and commercial launch of some medical devices, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority. In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product’s efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. In the U.S., the FDA requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products. Prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the FDA’s confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. For other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products. Areas of Focus In 2020 and beyond, Abbott’s significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following: Established Pharmaceuticals — Abbott focuses on building country-specific portfolios made up of high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. Over the next several years, Abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of being among the first to launch new off-patent and differentiated medicines. In addition, Abbott continues to expand existing brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. Abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as Creon™, Duphaston™, Duphalac™ and Influvac™. Depending on the product, the activities focus on development of new data, markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications. 34 Medical Devices — Abbott’s research and development programs focus on: Core Laboratory Diagnostics — Abbott continues to commercialize its next-generation blood screening, immunoassay, clinical chemistry and hematology systems, along with assays, including a focus on unmet medical need, in various areas including infectious disease, cardiac care, metabolics, and oncology, as well as informatics solutions to help optimize diagnostics laboratory performance and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories. Molecular Diagnostics — Several new molecular in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests and ‘Alinity m’, a next generation instrument system, are in various stages of development and launch. Rapid Diagnostics — Abbott’s research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for cardiometabolic disease, infectious disease and toxicology. Nutritionals — Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastro intestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years. Given the diversity of Abbott’s business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott’s total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott’s overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott’s 2019 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations. While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott’s ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device, diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is expected to approximate 7.0 percent of total Abbott sales in 2020. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period. 35 Goodwill At December 31, 2019, goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled $23.2 billion. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs, using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. The results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities amounted to $6.1 billion, $6.3 billion and $5.6 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in Net cash from operating activities in 2019 was primarily due to an increased investment in working capital, timing of pension contributions relative to 2018 and higher income tax payments, partially offset by the favorable cash flow impact of improved segment operating earnings and lower interest and acquisition-related expenses. The increase in Net cash from operating activities in 2018 was primarily due to higher segment operating earnings, continued improvements in working capital management, timing of pension contributions and lower acquisition-related expenses. The income tax component of cash from operating activities in 2018 includes the non-cash impact of the $120 million adjustment to the transition tax associated with the TCJA. The income tax component of operating cash flow in 2017 includes the non-cash impact of $1.46 billion of net tax expense related to the estimated impact of the TCJA. While a significant portion of Abbott’s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019, are reinvested in foreign subsidiaries, Abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. Due to the enactment of the TCJA, if these funds were needed for operations in the U.S., Abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds. Abbott funded $382 million in 2019, $114 million in 2018 and $645 million in 2017 to defined benefit pension plans. Abbott expects pension funding of approximately $387 million in 2020 for its pension plans. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbott’s capital expenditures and cash dividends. Debt and Capital At December 31, 2019, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was A- by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A3 by Moody’s. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. The lines of credit are part of a 2018 revolving credit agreement that expires in 2023. Any borrowings under the current revolving credit agreement will bear interest, at Abbott’s option, based on either a base rate or Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings. In conjunction with the funding of the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions and the assumption of St. Jude Medical’s and Alere’s existing debt, Abbott’s total short-term and long-term debt increased to $27.9 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase in debt included the following transactions: 36 In 2018, Abbott committed to reducing its debt levels and on February 16, 2018, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. Redemptions under this authorization during 2018 included $0.947 billion principal amount of its 5.125% Notes due 2019 and $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.35% Notes due 2019. Abbott incurred a net charge of $14 million related to the early repayment of this debt. On September 17, 2018, Abbott repaid upon maturity the $500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2.00% Senior Notes due 2018. On September 27, 2018, Abbott’s wholly owned subsidiary, Abbott Ireland Financing DAC, completed a euro debt offering of €3.420 billion of long-term debt. The proceeds equated to approximately $4 billion. The notes are guaranteed by Abbott. On October 28, 2018, Abbott redeemed $4.0 billion principal amount of its outstanding long-term debt. This amount is in addition to the $5 billion authorization discussed above. In conjunction with the redemption, Abbott unwound approximately $1.1 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 3.40% Note due in 2023 and the 3.75% Note due in 2026. Abbott incurred a net charge of $153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps. The 2018 transactions described above, including the repayment of $2.8 billion under the 5-year term loan and $1.15 billion of borrowings under the lines of credit, resulted in the net repayment of approximately $8.3 billion of debt. On February 24, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $500 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.80% Notes due 2020. In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. This bond redemption authorization superseded the board’s previous authorization under which $700 million had not yet been redeemed. On December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $2.850 billion outstanding principal amount of its 2.90% Notes due 2021. After redemption of the 2.90% Notes, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion debt redemption authorization remains available. On November 19, 2019, Abbott’s wholly owned subsidiary, Ireland Financing DAC, completed a euro debt offering of €1.180 billion of long-term debt. The proceeds equated to approximately $1.3 billion. The Notes are guaranteed by Abbott. On November 21, 2019, Abbott borrowed ¥59.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The term loan bears interest at TIBOR plus a fixed spread, and the interest rate is reset quarterly. The proceeds equated to approximately $550 million. The 2019 transactions described above resulted in the repayment of approximately of $1.6 billion of debt, net of borrowings, bringing Abbott’s total debt to $18.1 billion at December 31, 2019. In September 2014, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. Under the program authorized in 2014, Abbott repurchased 36.2 million shares at a cost of $1.666 billion in 2015, 10.4 million shares at a cost of $408 million in 2016, 1.9 million shares at a cost of $130 million in 2018, and 6.3 million shares at a cost of $525 million in 2019 for a total of approximately $2.730 billion. In October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. The new authorization is in addition to the $270 million unused portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2014. 37 On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. No shares have been issued under this authorization. Abbott declared dividends of $1.32 per share in 2019 compared to $1.16 per share in 2018, an increase of approximately 14 percent. Dividends paid were $2.270 billion in 2019 compared to $1.974 billion in 2018. The year-over-year change in dividends paid primarily reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate. Working Capital Working capital was $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019 and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease in working capital in 2019 reflects the presentation of $1.3 billion of Senior Notes due 2020 as current liabilities at December 31, 2019, partially offset by an overall net increase in working capital of approximately $485 million due to changes in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable associated with the growth of the business. Abbott monitors the credit worthiness of customers and establishes an allowance against a trade receivable when it is probable that the balance will not be collected. In addition to closely monitoring economic conditions and budgetary and other fiscal developments, Abbott regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. Abbott also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.6 billion in 2019, $1.4 billion in 2018 and $1.1 billion in 2017 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers. Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes Abbott’s estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Payments Due By Period ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2025 and (dollars in millions) Total 2020 2021 ‑ 2022 2023 ‑ 2024 Thereafter Long‑term debt, including current maturities ​ $ 18,049 ​ $ 1,278 ​ $ 757 ​ $ 3,527 ​ $ 12,487 Interest on debt obligations ​ 9,432 ​ 576 ​ 1,137 ​ 1,061 ​ 6,658 Operating lease obligations ​ 1,138 ​ 238 ​ 352 ​ 195 ​ 353 Purchase commitments (a) ​ 3,187 ​ 2,974 ​ 194 ​ 11 ​ 8 Other long‑term liabilities (b) ​ 4,117 ​ — ​ 1,885 ​ 1,178 ​ 1,054 Total (c) ​ $ 35,923 ​ $ 5,066 ​ $ 4,325 ​ $ 5,972 ​ $ 20,560 38 Contingent Obligations Abbott has periodically entered into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, which has resulted in Abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that Abbott was previously primarily liable. Since Abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, Abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these obligations. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. In addition, Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. Legislative Issues Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. Abbott does not expect adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings (Earnings employed in the business). Abbott adopted the new standard at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result of the adoption of the new standard, approximately $337 million of stranded tax effects were reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Earnings employed in the business. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which requires the recognition of the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the period in which the transfer occurs. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that was not significant. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. The new standard will be effective for Abbott at the beginning of 2020. Adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which requires lessees to measure and recognize a lease asset and liability on the balance sheet for most leases, including operating leases. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and applied the standard’s transition provisions as of January 1, 2019. As a result, no changes were made to the December 31, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Abbott elected to apply the package of practical expedients related to transition. These practical expedients allowed Abbott to carry forward its historical assessments of whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for each lease existing at January 1, 2019, and whether any initial direct costs for such leases qualified for capitalization. 39 The new lease accounting standard did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings but does have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of approximately $850 million of new right of use (ROU) assets and additional liabilities for operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which provides new guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2018. Under the new standard, changes in the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values are recorded in Other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Previously, such fair value changes were recorded in other comprehensive income. Abbott has elected the measurement alternative allowed by ASU 2016-01 for its equity investments without readily determinable fair values. These investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus any changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Changes in the measurement of these investments are being recorded in Other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. As part of the adoption, the cumulative-effect adjustment to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for net unrealized losses on equity investments that were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2017 was not significant. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which provides a single comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and supersedes nearly all previously existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach method. Under this method, entities recognize the cumulative effect of applying the new standard at the date of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods presented. The cumulative effect of applying the new standard resulted in an increase to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $23 million which was recorded on January 1, 2018. The new standard has been applied only to those contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. The impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 was not significant to individual financial statement line items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors. ​ 40 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments and Risk Management Market Price Sensitive Investments The fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $11 million and $13 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2019 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $346 million and $307 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments, as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings. Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $158 million and $211 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $61 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $2.9 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $20.8 billion and $19.9 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.3% and 3.5% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively) with maturities through 2046. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values. (A 100-basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in rates.) Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Abbott held $6.8 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2019 will mature in 2020 or 2021 depending upon the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2018 matured in 2019 or will mature in 2020 depending upon the contract. Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Abbott held $9.1 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next 13 months. In November 2019, Abbott borrowed ¥59.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. From the date of the borrowing through December 31, 2019, the value of this long-term debt decreased approximately $4 million to $546 million due to foreign exchange rate changes. The change in the value was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. In March 2017, Abbott repaid its $479 million yen-denominated short-term debt which was designated as a hedge of the net 41 investment in a foreign subsidiary. At December 31, 2016, the value of this short-term debt was $454 million, and changes in the fair value of the debt up through the date of repayment due to changes in exchange rates were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.

Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies NATURE OF BUSINESS — Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. USE OF ESTIMATES — The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for sales rebates, income taxes, pension and other post-employment benefits, valuation of intangible assets, litigation, derivative financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION — The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. REVENUE RECOGNITION — Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Revenue from the launch of a new product, from an improved version of an existing product, or for shipments in excess of a customer’s normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve for such revenue, if necessary. In certain of Abbott’s businesses, primarily within diagnostics, Abbott participates in selling arrangements that include multiple performance obligations (e.g., instruments, reagents, procedures, and service agreements). The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Sales of product rights for marketable products are recorded as revenue upon disposition of the rights. INCOME TAXES — Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when the taxes are paid. No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings. EARNINGS PER SHARE — Unvested restricted stock units and awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $ 3.666 billion, $ 2.320 billion and $ 346 million, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $ 3.666 billion, $ 2.353 billion and $ 468 million, respectively. ​ 50 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) PENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS — Abbott accrues for the actuarially determined cost of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a five - year period. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS — For assets and liabilities that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs are valued by reference to similar assets or liabilities, adjusted for contract restrictions and other terms specific to that asset or liability. For these items, a significant portion of fair value is derived by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets. For all remaining assets and liabilities, fair value is derived using a fair value model, such as a discounted cash flow model or Black-Scholes model. Purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value. The fair value of significant purchased intangible assets is based on independent appraisals. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION — The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards and units are amortized over their requisite service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible, with a charge to compensation expense. LITIGATION — Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management’s best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. Legal fees are recorded as incurred. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS — Cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits, U.S. government securities money market funds and U.S. treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less. Abbott holds certain investments with a carrying value of $ 321 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments held in a rabbi trust and investments in publicly traded equity securities are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. Investments in equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity, as management has both the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity, and are reported at cost, net of any unamortized premium or discount. Income relating to these securities is reported as interest income. TRADE RECEIVABLE VALUATIONS — Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance against gross trade receivables reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information. Accounts receivable are charged off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted. INVENTORIES — Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost includes material and conversion costs. ​ 51 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT — Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table shows estimated useful lives of property and equipment: ​ ​ ​ ​ Classification Estimated Useful Lives Buildings 10 to 50 years Equipment 3 to 20 years ​ PRODUCT LIABILITY — Abbott accrues for product liability claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The liabilities are adjusted quarterly as additional information becomes available. Product liability losses are self-insured. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS — Internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) — The initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as IPR&D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical or medical device products. The fair value of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completed and are then amortized over the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant. CONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES — Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. Product warranties are not significant. Abbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, with other companies, which has resulted in Abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that Abbott was previously primarily liable. Since Abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, Abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these obligations. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. ​ Note 2 – New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings (Earnings employed in the business). Abbott adopted the new standard at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result of the adoption of the new standard, approximately $ 337 million of stranded tax effects were reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Earnings employed in the business. ​ 52 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2 – New Accounting Standards (Continued) In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which requires the recognition of the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the period in which the transfer occurs. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that was not significant. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which requires lessees to measure and recognize a lease asset and liability on the balance sheet for most leases, including operating leases. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and applied the standard’s transition provisions as of January 1, 2019. As a result, no changes were made to the December 31, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Abbott elected to apply the package of practical expedients related to transition. These practical expedients allowed Abbott to carry forward its historical assessments of whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for each lease existing at January 1, 2019, and whether any initial direct costs for such leases qualified for capitalization. The new lease accounting standard did not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings but does have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of approximately $ 850 million of new right of use (ROU) assets and additional liabilities for operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which provides new guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2018. Under the new standard, changes in the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values are recorded in Other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Previously, such fair value changes were recorded in other comprehensive income. Abbott has elected the measurement alternative allowed by ASU 2016-01 for its equity investments without readily determinable fair values. These investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus any changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Changes in the measurement of these investments are being recorded in Other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. As part of the adoption, the cumulative-effect adjustment to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for net unrealized losses on equity investments that were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2017 was not significant. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which provides a single comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and supersedes nearly all previously existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach method. Under this method, entities recognize the cumulative effect of applying the new standard at the date of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods presented. The cumulative effect of applying the new standard resulted in an increase to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $ 23 million which was recorded on January 1, 2018. The new standard has been applied only to those contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. The impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 was not significant to individual financial statement line items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. ​ 53 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2 – New Accounting Standards (Continued) Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. Abbott does not expect adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses , which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. The new standard will be effective for Abbott at the beginning of 2020. Adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. ​ Note 3 — Revenue Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott's products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians' offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. 54 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) The following tables provide detail by sales category: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2019 ​ 2018 ​ 2017 (in millions) U.S. Int'l Total U.S. Int'l Total U.S. Int'l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 3,392 ​ $ 3,392 ​ $ — ​ $ 3,363 ​ $ 3,363 ​ $ — ​ $ 3,307 ​ $ 3,307 Other ​ — ​ 1,094 ​ 1,094 ​ — ​ 1,059 ​ 1,059 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 980 ​ ​ 980 Total ​ — ​ 4,486 ​ 4,486 ​ — ​ 4,422 ​ 4,422 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 4,287 ​ ​ 4,287 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 1,879 ​ 2,282 ​ 4,161 ​ 1,843 ​ 2,254 ​ 4,097 ​ ​ 1,777 ​ ​ 2,112 ​ ​ 3,889 Adult Nutritionals ​ 1,231 ​ 2,017 ​ 3,248 ​ 1,232 ​ 1,900 ​ 3,132 ​ ​ 1,254 ​ ​ 1,782 ​ ​ 3,036 Total ​ 3,110 ​ 4,299 ​ 7,409 ​ 3,075 ​ 4,154 ​ 7,229 ​ ​ 3,031 ​ ​ 3,894 ​ ​ 6,925 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 1,086 ​ 3,570 ​ 4,656 ​ 985 ​ 3,401 ​ 4,386 ​ ​ 921 ​ ​ 3,142 ​ ​ 4,063 Molecular ​ 149 ​ 293 ​ 442 ​ 152 ​ 332 ​ 484 ​ ​ 160 ​ ​ 303 ​ ​ 463 Point of Care ​ 438 ​ 123 ​ 561 ​ 432 ​ 121 ​ 553 ​ ​ 440 ​ ​ 110 ​ ​ 550 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 1,214 ​ 840 ​ 2,054 ​ 1,148 ​ 924 ​ 2,072 ​ ​ 296 ​ ​ 244 ​ ​ 540 Total ​ 2,887 ​ 4,826 ​ 7,713 ​ 2,717 ​ 4,778 ​ 7,495 ​ ​ 1,817 ​ ​ 3,799 ​ ​ 5,616 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management (a) ​ 1,057 ​ 1,087 ​ 2,144 ​ 1,105 ​ 1,093 ​ 2,198 ​ ​ 1,043 ​ ​ 1,089 ​ ​ 2,132 Electrophysiology (a) ​ 742 ​ 979 ​ 1,721 ​ 678 ​ 883 ​ 1,561 ​ ​ 596 ​ ​ 757 ​ ​ 1,353 Heart Failure ​ 574 ​ 195 ​ 769 ​ 467 ​ 179 ​ 646 ​ ​ 491 ​ ​ 152 ​ ​ 643 Vascular ​ 1,047 ​ 1,803 ​ 2,850 ​ 1,126 ​ 1,803 ​ 2,929 ​ ​ 1,180 ​ ​ 1,712 ​ ​ 2,892 Structural Heart ​ 616 ​ 784 ​ 1,400 ​ 488 ​ 751 ​ 1,239 ​ ​ 432 ​ ​ 651 ​ ​ 1,083 Neuromodulation ​ 660 ​ 171 ​ 831 ​ 690 ​ 174 ​ 864 ​ ​ 636 ​ ​ 172 ​ ​ 808 Diabetes Care ​ ​ 678 ​ ​ 1,846 ​ ​ 2,524 ​ ​ 457 ​ ​ 1,476 ​ ​ 1,933 ​ ​ 332 ​ ​ 1,082 ​ ​ 1,414 Total ​ 5,374 ​ 6,865 ​ 12,239 ​ 5,011 ​ 6,359 ​ 11,370 ​ ​ 4,710 ​ ​ 5,615 ​ ​ 10,325 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other (b) ​ 27 ​ 30 ​ 57 ​ 36 ​ 26 ​ 62 ​ ​ 115 ​ ​ 122 ​ ​ 237 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ $ 11,398 ​ $ 20,506 ​ $ 31,904 ​ $ 10,839 ​ $ 19,739 ​ $ 30,578 ​ $ 9,673 ​ $ 17,717 ​ $ 27,390 (a) Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) sales, which had previously been reported in Electrophysiology, are now included in Rhythm Management. Historic periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. (b) Diabetes Care sales, which had previously been reported in Other, are now included in the Medical Devices segment. Historic periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Abbott recognizes revenue from product sales upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. For maintenance agreements that provide service beyond Abbott’s standard warranty and other service agreements, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. A time-based measure of progress appropriately reflects the transfer of services to the customer. Payment terms between Abbott and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant. ​ 55 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) Management exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Abbott provides rebates to government agencies, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Other allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott's historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant. Abbott also applies judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts that include multiple performance obligations. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. For goods or services for which observable standalone selling prices are not available, Abbott uses an expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2019, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 3.3 billion in the Diagnostic Products segment and approximately $ 380 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months , approximately 16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50 -14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. Assets Recognized for Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer Abbott has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and records as an expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers in the period of occurrence when the amortization period of the asset that Abbott otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Upfront commission fees paid to sales personnel as a result of obtaining or renewing contracts with customers are incremental to obtaining the contract. Abbott capitalizes these amounts as contract costs. Capitalized commission fees are amortized based on the contract duration to which the assets relate which ranges from two to ten years . The amounts as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not significant. ​ 56 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) Additionally, the cost of transmitters provided to customers that use Abbott’s remote monitoring service with respect to certain medical devices are capitalized as contract costs. Capitalized transmitter costs are amortized based on the timing of the transfer of services to which the assets relate, which typically ranges from eight to ten years . The amounts as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not significant. Other Contract Assets and Liabilities Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their net realizable value. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Contract Liabilities ​ ​ ​ Balance at January 1, 2018 ​ $ 198 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ ​ 304 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ​ ( 243 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 ​ ​ 259 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ 411 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ( 376 ) Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 294 ​ ​ Note 4 — Discontinued Operations and Business Dispositions In February 2015, Abbott completed the sale of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to Mylan Inc. (Mylan) for 110 million ordinary shares (or approximately 22 percent) of a newly formed entity (Mylan N.V.) that combined Mylan’s existing business and Abbott’s developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business. In April 2015, Abbott sold 40.25 million of the 110 million ordinary shares of Mylan N.V. and recorded a pretax gain of $ 207 million on $ 2.29 billion in net proceeds from the sale of these shares. In 2017, Abbott sold 69.75 million ordinary shares of Mylan N.V. and received $ 2.704 billion in proceeds. Abbott recorded a $ 45 million gain from the sale of these ordinary shares in 2017, which was recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Abbott no longer has an ownership interest in Mylan N.V. The net earnings of discontinued operations include income tax benefits of $ 39 million in 2018 and $ 109 million in 2017. These tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to AbbVie’s operations for years prior to the separation. Abbott completed the separation of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie), which was formed to hold Abbott’s research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business, in January 2013. Abbott has retained all liabilities for all U.S. federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation, as well as certain non-income taxes attributable to AbbVie’s business. AbbVie generally will be liable for all other taxes attributable to its business. ​ 57 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 4 — Discontinued Operations and Business Dispositions (Continued) In September 2016, Abbott announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), its vision care business, to Johnson & Johnson for $ 4.325 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for cash, debt and working capital. The decision to sell AMO reflected Abbott's proactive shaping of its portfolio in line with its strategic priorities. In February 2017, Abbott completed the sale of AMO to Johnson & Johnson and recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 1.163 billion including working capital adjustments, which was reported in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in 2017. Abbott recorded an after-tax gain of $ 728 million in 2017 related to the sale of AMO. The operating results of AMO up to the date of sale continued to be included in Earnings from continuing operations as the business did not qualify for reporting as discontinued operations. For 2017, the AMO loss before taxes included in Abbott’s consolidated earnings was $ 18 million. ​ Note 5 — Supplemental Financial Information Other (income) expense, net, for 2019, 2018 and 2017 includes approximately $ 225 million, $ 160 million and $ 160 million of income, respectively, related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. Other (income) expense, net, for 2017 includes a pre-tax gain of $ 1.163 billion related to the sale of AMO to Johnson & Johnson. In 2017, Abbott recorded a $ 45 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of the Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. See Note 4 — Discontinued Operations and Business Dispositions for further discussion of these 2017 sales. The detail of various balance sheet components is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 Long-term Investments: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 836 ​ $ 856 Other ​ 47 ​ 41 Total ​ $ 883 ​ $ 897 ​ Abbott’s equity securities as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, include $ 346 million and $ 307 million, respectively, of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. Abbott also holds certain investments as of December 31, 2019 with a carrying value of $ 321 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of $ 158 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The $ 158 million carrying value includes an unrealized gain of approximately $ 50 million on an investment. The gain was recorded in the second quarter of 2018 and relates to an observable price change for a similar investment of the same issuer. ​ 58 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) In the first quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc., Abbott acquired a research & development (R&D) asset valued at $ 102 million, which was immediately expensed. The $ 102 million of expense was recorded in the R&D line of Abbott's Consolidated Statement of Earnings. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 Other Accrued Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Accrued rebates payable to government agencies ​ $ 212 ​ $ 166 Accrued other rebates (a) ​ 655 ​ 608 All other ​ 3,168 ​ 3,006 Total ​ $ 4,035 ​ $ 3,780 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ December 31, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 Post-employment Obligations and Other Long-term Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical and dental plans for significant plans ​ $ 2,817 ​ $ 2,040 Deferred income taxes ​ 1,546 ​ 2,056 Operating lease liabilities ​ ​ 755 ​ ​ — All other (b) ​ 3,944 ​ 3,984 Total ​ $ 9,062 ​ $ 8,080 ​ ​ 59 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 6 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The components of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income taxes, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative ​ Cumulative ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Actuarial ​ Unrealized ​ Gains (Losses) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative ​ (Losses) ​ Gains (Losses) ​ on Derivative ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreign ​ and Prior ​ on ​ Instruments ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Currency ​ Service ​ Marketable ​ Designated as ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Translation ​ (Costs) and ​ Equity ​ Cash Flow ​ ​ ​ (in millions) Adjustments Credits Securities Hedges Total Balance at December 31, 2017 ​ $ ( 3,452 ) ​ $ ( 2,521 ) ​ $ ( 5 ) ​ $ ( 84 ) ​ $ ( 6,062 ) Impact of adoption of new accounting standards ​ ​ — ​ ​ ( 337 ) ​ ​ 5 ​ ​ — ​ ​ ( 332 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ​ ( 1,488 ) ​ ( 18 ) ​ — ​ 58 ​ ( 1,448 ) (Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (a) ​ ​ 28 ​ 150 ​ — ​ 78 ​ 256 Net current period other comprehensive income (loss) ​ ​ ( 1,460 ) ​ 132 ​ — ​ 136 ​ ( 1,192 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 ​ ​ ( 4,912 ) ​ ​ ( 2,726 ) ​ ​ — ​ ​ 52 ​ ​ ( 7,586 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ​ ( 12 ) ​ ( 719 ) ​ — ​ 2 ​ ( 729 ) (Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (a) ​ ​ — ​ ( 95 ) ​ — ​ ( 55 ) ​ ( 150 ) Net current period other comprehensive income (loss) ​ ​ ( 12 ) ​ ​ ( 814 ) ​ ​ — ​ ​ ( 53 ) ​ ​ ( 879 ) Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ ( 4,924 ) ​ $ ( 3,540 ) ​ $ — ​ $ ( 1 ) ​ $ ( 8,465 ) ​ Note 7 — Business Acquisitions On January 4, 2017, Abbott completed the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, a global medical device manufacturer, for approximately $ 23.6 billion, including approximately $ 13.6 billion in cash and approximately $ 10 billion in Abbott common shares, which represented approximately 254 million shares of Abbott common stock, based on Abbott’s closing stock price on the acquisition date. As part of the acquisition, approximately $ 5.9 billion of St. Jude Medical’s debt was assumed, repaid or refinanced by Abbott. The acquisition provides expanded opportunities for future growth and is an important part of the company's ongoing effort to develop a strong, diverse portfolio of devices, diagnostics, nutritionals and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The combined business competes in nearly every area of the cardiovascular device market, as well as in the neuromodulation market. Under the terms of the agreement, for each St. Jude Medical common share, St. Jude Medical shareholders received $ 46.75 in cash and 0.8708 of an Abbott common share. At an Abbott stock price of $ 39.36 , which reflects the closing price on January 4, 2017, this represented a value of approximately $ 81 per St. Jude Medical common share and total purchase consideration of $ 23.6 billion. The cash portion of the acquisition was funded through a combination of medium and long-term debt issued in November 2016 and a $ 2.0 billion 120-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility which was subsequently repaid. ​ 60 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7 — Business Acquisitions (Continued) In 2016, Abbott and St. Jude Medical agreed to sell certain businesses to Terumo Corporation (Terumo) for approximately $ 1.12 billion. The sale included the St. Jude Medical Angio-Seal™ and Femoseal™ vascular closure and Abbott’s Vado ® Steerable Sheath businesses. The sale closed on January 20, 2017 and no gain or loss was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. On October 3, 2017, Abbott acquired Alere, a diagnostic device and service provider, for $ 51.00 per common share in cash, which equated to a purchase price of approximately $ 4.5 billion. As part of the acquisition, Abbott tendered for Alere’s preferred shares for a total value of approximately $ 0.7 billion. In addition, approximately $ 3.0 billion of Alere’s debt was assumed and subsequently repaid. The acquisition establishes Abbott as a leader in point of care testing, expands Abbott’s global diagnostics presence and provides access to new products, channels and geographies. Abbott utilized a combination of cash on hand and debt to fund the acquisition. See Note 11 — Debt and Lines of Credit for further details regarding the debt utilized for the acquisition. In the third quarter of 2017, Alere entered into agreements to sell its Triage MeterPro cardiovascular and toxicology business and the assets and liabilities related to its B-type Natriuretic Peptide assay business run on Beckman Coulter analyzers to Quidel. The transactions with Quidel reflect a total purchase price of $ 400 million payable at the close of the transaction, $ 240 million payable in six annual installments beginning approximately six months after the close of the transaction, and contingent consideration with a maximum value of $ 40 million. In the third quarter of 2017, Alere entered into an agreement with Siemens Diagnostics Holding II B.V. (Siemens) to sell its subsidiary, Epocal Inc., for approximately $ 200 million payable at the close of the transaction. Alere agreed to divest these businesses in connection with the review by the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission of Abbott’s agreement to acquire Alere. The sale to Quidel closed on October 6, 2017, and the sale to Siemens closed on October 31, 2017. No gain or loss on these sales was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In 2017, consolidated Abbott results include $ 6.5 billion of sales and a pre-tax loss of approximately $ 1.3 billion related to the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions, including approximately $ 1.5 billion of intangible amortization and $ 907 million of inventory step-up amortization. The pre-tax loss excludes acquisition, integration and restructuring-related costs. If the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere had occurred at the beginning of 2016, unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales would have been approximately $ 28.9 billion and the unaudited pro forma consolidated net loss from continuing operations would have been approximately $ 485 million in 2016. This includes amortization of approximately $ 940 million of inventory step-up and $ 1.7 billion of intangibles related to St. Jude Medical and Alere. For 2017, unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales would have been approximately $ 28.9 billion and unaudited pro forma consolidated net earnings from continuing operations would have been approximately $ 750 million, which includes $ 225 million of intangible amortization related to Alere. The unaudited pro forma consolidated net earnings from continuing operations for 2017 exclude inventory step-up amortization related to St. Jude Medical and Alere of approximately $ 907 million which was recorded in 2017 but included in the 2016 unaudited pro forma results as noted above. The unaudited pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that would have been realized had the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions been completed as of the beginning of 2016, nor is it meant to be indicative of future results of operations that the combined entity will experience. ​ 61 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7 — Business Acquisitions (Continued) On July 17, 2017, Abbott commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash the 1.77 million outstanding shares of Alere’s Series B Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock at a price of $ 402 per share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends to, but not including, the settlement date of the tender offer. This tender offer was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including Abbott’s acquisition of Alere and upon there being validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn) at the expiration date of the tender offer that number of shares of Preferred Stock that equaled at least a majority of the Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the expiration of the tender offer. The tender offer expired on October 3, 2017. All conditions to the offer were satisfied and Abbott accepted for payment the 1.748 million shares of Preferred Stock that were validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn). The remaining shares were cashed out for an amount equal to the $ 400.00 per share liquidation preference of such shares, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, without interest. Payment for all of the shares of Preferred Stock was made in the fourth quarter of 2017. Note 8 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 23.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and $ 23.3 billion at December 31, 2018. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $ 103 million in 2019 and $ 440 million in 2018. Purchase price accounting adjustments associated with the Alere acquisition decreased goodwill by $ 326 million in 2018. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at December 31, 2019 was $ 3.0 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.7 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.1 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no significant reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2019 and 2018. The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $ 27.6 billion and $ 25.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $ 11.9 billion and $ 10.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by approximately $ 71 million in 2019 and $ 281 million in 2018. In 2018, purchase price allocation adjustments increased intangible assets by $ 280 million. The estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2019 is approximately $ 2.1 billion in 2020, $ 2.0 billion in 2021, $ 2.0 billion in 2022, $ 2.0 billion in 2023 and $ 1.9 billion in 2024. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over 2 to 20 years . Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 1.3 billion and $ 3.6 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease is due to an in-process research and development intangible asset related to the Medical Devices segment that became amortizable at the end of 2019. In 2017, Abbott recorded a $ 53 million impairment of an in-process research and development project related to the Medical Devices segment. 62 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 9 — Restructuring Plans From 2017 to 2019, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $ 72 million in 2019, $ 52 million in 2018 and $ 187 million in 2017. Approximately $ 19 million in 2019, $ 5 million in 2018 and $ 5 million in 2017 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 4 million in 2019 and $ 10 million in 2018 are recorded in Research and development, and approximately $ 49 million in 2019, $ 37 million in 2018 and $ 182 million in 2017 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Abbott also assumed restructuring liabilities of approximately $ 23 million as part of the St Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions. The following summarizes the activity related to these actions and the status of the related accruals: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Liabilities assumed as part of business acquisitions ​ $ 23 Restructuring charges ​ ​ 187 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 142 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2017 ​ ​ 68 Restructuring charges ​ 52 Payments and other adjustments ​ ( 79 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2018 ​ ​ 41 Restructuring charges ​ ​ 72 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 67 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 46 ​ From 2016 to 2019, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $ 66 million in 2019, $ 28 million in 2018 and $ 120 million in 2017. Approximately $ 16 million in 2019, $ 10 million in 2018 and $ 7 million in 2017 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 28 million in 2019, $ 2 million in 2018 and $ 77 million in 2017 are recorded in Research and development, and approximately $ 22 million in 2019, $ 16 million in 2018 and $ 36 million in 2017 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Additional charges of approximately $ 2 million in 2017 were recorded, primarily for accelerated depreciation. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Restructuring charges recorded in 2016 ​ $ 32 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 15 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2016 ​ ​ 17 Restructuring charges ​ ​ 120 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 18 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2017 ​ ​ 119 Restructuring charges ​ ​ 28 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 77 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2018 ​ ​ 70 Restructuring charges ​ ​ 66 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 57 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 79 ​ ​ 63 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 10 — Incentive Stock Program The 2017 Incentive Stock Program authorizes the granting of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards, foreign benefits and other share-based awards. Stock options and restricted stock awards and units comprise the majority of benefits that have been granted and are currently outstanding under this program and a prior program. In 2019, Abbott granted 4,579,283 stock options, 736,100 restricted stock awards and 6,628,009 restricted stock units under this program. Under Abbott’s stock incentive programs, the purchase price of shares under option must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the maximum term of an option is 10 years . Options generally vest equally over three years . Restricted stock awards generally vest over 3 years , with no more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year upon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target. Restricted stock units vest over three years and upon vesting, the recipient receives one share of Abbott stock for each vested restricted stock unit. The aggregate fair market value of options and restricted stock awards and units is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which may be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant. Restricted stock awards and settlement of vested restricted stock units are issued out of treasury shares. Abbott generally issues new shares for exercises of stock options. As a policy, Abbott does not purchase its shares relating to its share-based programs. In April 2017, Abbott’s shareholders authorized the 2017 Incentive Stock Program under which a maximum of 170 million shares were available for issuance. At December 31, 2019, approximately 127 million shares remained available for future issuance. In connection with the completion of the St. Jude Medical acquisition in the first quarter of 2017, unvested St. Jude Medical stock options and restricted stock units were assumed by Abbott and converted into Abbott options and restricted stock units (as applicable) of substantially equivalent value, in accordance with the merger agreement. The number of shares underlying the converted options was 7,364,571 at a weighted average exercise price of $ 30.50 . The number of restricted stock units converted was 2,324,500 at a weighted average grant date fair value of $ 37.69 . The following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2019. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ Average ​ ​ Aggregate ​ ​ ​ ​ Exercise ​ Remaining ​ ​ Intrinsic (intrinsic values in millions) Options Price Life (Years) Value Outstanding at December 31, 2018 ​ 33,074,613 ​ $ 42.21 6.3 ​ $ 996 Granted 4,579,283 ​ 76.35 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Exercised ( 7,281,472 ) ​ 35.51 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Lapsed ( 494,509 ) ​ 60.06 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding at December 31, 2019 29,877,915 ​ $ 48.78 6.2 ​ $ 1,138 Exercisable at December 31, 2019 ​ 20,555,321 ​ $ 41.26 ​ 5.3 ​ ​ $ 937 ​ 64 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 10 — Incentive Stock Program (Continued) The following table summarizes restricted stock awards and units activity for 2019. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Weighted ​ ​ ​ ​ Average ​ ​ ​ Grant-Date ​ ​ Share Units ​ Fair Value Outstanding at December 31, 2018 15,952,602 ​ $ 52.11 Granted 7,364,109 ​ 76.17 Vested ( 7,750,049 ) ​ 48.52 Forfeited ( 1,103,348 ) ​ 62.28 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 14,463,314 ​ $ 65.51 ​ The fair market value of restricted stock awards and units vested in 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ 588 million, $ 458 million and $ 348 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ 315 million, $ 249 million and $ 233 million, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to all share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2019 amounted to approximately $ 419 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . Total non-cash stock compensation expense charged against income from continuing operations in 2019, 2018 and 2017 for share-based plans totaled approximately $ 519 million, $ 477 million and $ 406 million, respectively, and the tax benefit recognized was approximately $ 197 million, $ 185 million and $ 242 million, respectively. The decrease in the tax benefit in 2018 primarily relates to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 %. Stock compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory is not significant. The table below summarizes the fair value of an option granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017 and the assumptions included in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model used to estimate the fair value: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2019 2018 2017 ​ Fair value ​ $ 14.50 ​ $ 10.93 ​ $ 6.54 ​ Risk-free interest rate ​ 2.5 % ​ 2.7 % ​ 2.1 % Average life of options (years) ​ 6.0 ​ ​ 6.0 ​ ​ 6.0 ​ Volatility ​ 19.8 % ​ 19.0 % ​ 18.0 % Dividend yield ​ 1.7 % ​ 1.9 % ​ 2.4 % ​ The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates available at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected life. The average life of an option is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Abbott’s stock and historical volatility of Abbott’s stock over the expected life of the option. Dividend yield is based on the option’s exercise price and annual dividend rate at the time of grant. 65 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11 — Debt and Lines of Credit The following is a summary of long-term debt at December 31: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2019 2018 0.00 % Notes, due 2020 ​ $ 1,272 ​ $ 1,300 2.80 % Notes, due 2020 ​ — ​ 500 2.90 % Notes, due 2021 ​ ​ — ​ ​ 2,850 2.55 % Notes, due 2022 ​ ​ 750 ​ ​ 750 0.875 % Notes, due 2023 ​ ​ 1,272 ​ ​ 1,303 3.40 % Notes, due 2023 ​ ​ 1,050 ​ ​ 1,050 5-year term loan due 2024 ​ ​ 546 ​ ​ — 0.10 % Notes, due 2024 ​ ​ 658 ​ ​ — 3.875 % Notes, due 2025 ​ ​ 500 ​ ​ 500 2.95 % Notes, due 2025 ​ ​ 1,000 ​ ​ 1,000 1.50 % Notes, due 2026 ​ ​ 1,272 ​ ​ 1,300 3.75 % Notes, due 2026 ​ ​ 1,700 ​ ​ 1,700 0.375 % Notes, due 2027 ​ ​ 658 ​ ​ — 4.75 % Notes, due 2036 ​ ​ 1,650 ​ ​ 1,650 6.15 % Notes, due 2037 ​ 547 ​ 547 6.00 % Notes, due 2039 ​ 515 ​ 515 5.30 % Notes, due 2040 ​ 694 ​ 694 4.75 % Notes, due 2043 ​ 700 ​ 700 4.90 % Notes, due 2046 ​ ​ 3,250 ​ ​ 3,250 Unamortized debt issuance costs ​ ​ ( 90 ) ​ ​ ( 102 ) Other, including fair value adjustments relating to interest rate hedge contracts designated as fair value hedges ​ ( 6 ) ​ ( 141 ) Total carrying amount of long-term debt ​ 17,938 ​ 19,366 Less: Current portion ​ 1,277 ​ 7 Total long-term portion ​ $ 16,661 ​ $ 19,359 ​ On February 16, 2018, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $ 5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. Redemptions under this authorization include the following: Abbott incurred a net charge of $ 14 million related to the March 22, 2018 early repayment of debt. In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $ 5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. This bond redemption authorization supersedes the board’s previous authorization under which $ 700 million had not yet been redeemed. ​ 66 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11 — Debt and Lines of Credit (Continued) On November 19, 2019, Abbott's wholly owned subsidiary, Ireland Financing DAC, completed an offering of € 1.180 billion of long-term debt consisting of € 590 million of 0.10 % Notes due 2024 and € 590 million of 0.375 % Notes due 2027. The proceeds equated to approximately $ 1.3 billion. The Notes are guaranteed by Abbott. On November 21, 2019, Abbott borrowed ¥ 59.8 billion under a 5 -year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The term loan bears interest at TIBOR plus a fixed spread, and the interest rate is reset quarterly. The proceeds equated to approximately $ 550 million. On December 19, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $ 2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.9 % Notes due 2021. Abbott incurred a charge of $ 63 million related to the early repayment of this debt. On September 17, 2018, Abbott repaid upon maturity the $ 500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2.00 % Senior Notes due 2018. On September 27, 2018, Abbott’s wholly owned subsidiary, Abbott Ireland Financing DAC, completed a euro debt offering of € 3.420 billion of long-term debt consisting of € 1.140 billion of non-interest bearing Senior Notes due 2020 at 99.727 % of par value; € 1.140 billion of 0.875 % Senior Notes due 2023 at 99.912 % of par value; and € 1.140 billion of 1.50 % Senior Notes due 2026 at 99.723 % of par value. The proceeds equated to approximately $ 4 billion. The notes are guaranteed by Abbott. On October 28, 2018, Abbott redeemed approximately $ 4 billion of debt, which included $ 750 million principal amount of its 2.00 % Notes due 2020; $ 597 million principal amount of its 4.125 % Notes due 2020; $ 900 million principal amount of its 3.25 % Notes due 2023; $ 450 million principal amount of its 3.4 % Notes due 2023; and $ 1.300 billion principal amount of its 3.75 % Notes due 2026. These amounts are in addition to the $ 5 billion authorization in 2018 discussed above. In conjunction with the redemption, Abbott unwound approximately $ 1.1 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 3.40 % Note due in 2023 and the 3.75 % Note due in 2026. Abbott incurred a net charge of $ 153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps. On November 30, 2018, Abbott entered into a Five Year Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) and terminated the 2014 revolving credit agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2014 revolving credit agreement at the time of its termination. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $ 5 billion on an unsecured basis. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on November 30, 2023. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest, at Abbott’s option, based on either a base rate or Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings. In the first quarter of 2017, as part of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Abbott’s long-term debt increased due to the assumption of outstanding debt previously issued by St. Jude Medical. Abbott exchanged certain St. Jude Medical debt obligations with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $ 2.9 billion for debt issued by Abbott which consists of: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) Principal Amount 2.00 % Senior Notes due 2018 ​ $ 473.8 2.80 % Senior Notes due 2020 ​ ​ 483.7 3.25 % Senior Notes due 2023 ​ ​ 818.4 3.875 % Senior Notes due 2025 ​ ​ 490.7 4.75 % Senior Notes due 2043 ​ ​ 639.1 ​ 67 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11 — Debt and Lines of Credit (Continued) Following this exchange, approximately $ 194.2 million of existing St. Jude Medical notes remained outstanding across the five series of existing notes which have the same coupons and maturities as those listed above. There were no significant costs associated with the exchange of debt. In addition, during the first quarter of 2017, Abbott assumed and subsequently repaid approximately $ 2.8 billion of various St. Jude Medical debt obligations. In 2017, Abbott issued 364-day yen-denominated debt, of which $ 201 million and $ 199 million was outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2017, Abbott also paid off a $ 479 million yen-denominated short-term borrowing during the year. On July 31, 2017, Abbott entered into a 5-year term loan agreement that allowed Abbott to borrow up to $ 2.8 billion on an unsecured basis for the acquisition of Alere. On October 3, 2017, Abbott borrowed $ 2.8 billion under this term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of Alere, to repay certain indebtedness of Abbott and Alere, and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition. Borrowings under the term loan bore interest based on a Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings. Abbott paid off this term loan on January 5, 2018. On October 3, 2017 Abbott borrowed $ 1.7 billion under its lines of credit. Proceeds from such borrowing were used to finance the acquisition of Alere, to repay certain indebtedness of Abbott and Alere, and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition. These lines of credit were part of a 2014 revolving credit agreement that provided Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $ 5 billion on an unsecured basis. Advances under the revolving credit agreement, including the $ 1.7 billion borrowing in October 2017, were scheduled to mature and be payable on July 10, 2019. The $ 1.7 billion borrowing bore interest based on a Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott’s credit ratings. Prior to October 3, 2017, no amounts were previously drawn under the revolving credit agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Abbott paid off $ 550 million on the revolving loan. Abbott paid off the remaining balance on this revolving loan on January 5, 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2017, in conjunction with the acquisition of Alere, Abbott assumed and subsequently repaid $ 3.0 billion of Alere’s debt. Principal payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 are $ 1.3 billion in 2020, $ 5 million in 2021, $ 752 million in 2022, $ 2.3 billion in 2023, $ 1.2 billion in 2024 and $ 12.5 billion in 2025 and thereafter. At December 31, 2019, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was A- by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A3 by Moody’s. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $ 5.0 billion which expire in 2023 and support commercial paper borrowing arrangements. Abbott’s weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings was 0.4 % at December 31, 2019, 0.4 % at December 31, 2018 and 0.3 % at December 31, 2017. Note 12 — Leases Leases where Abbott is the Lessee Abbott has entered into operating leases as the lessee for office space, manufacturing facilities, R&D laboratories, warehouses, vehicles and equipment. Finance leases are not significant. Abbott’s operating leases generally have remaining lease terms of 1 to 10 years . Some leases include options to extend beyond the original lease term , generally up to 10 years and some include options to terminate early . These options have been included in the determination of the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. For all of its asset classes, Abbott elected the practical expedient allowed under FASB ASC No. 842, “Leases” to account for each lease component (e.g., the right to use office space) and the associated non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services) as a single lease component. Abbott also elected the short-term lease accounting policy for all asset classes; therefore, Abbott is not recognizing a lease liability or ROU asset for any lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that Abbott is reasonably certain to exercise. ​ 68 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 12 — Leases (Continued) As Abbott’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the interest rate used to determine the present value of the payments under each lease typically reflects Abbott’s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. Abbott’s incremental borrowing rates at January 1, 2019 were used for operating leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019. The following table provides information related to Abbott’s operating leases: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Year Ended (in millions) December 31, 2019 Operating lease cost (a) ​ $ 314 ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities ​ $ 253 ​ ​ ​ ​ ROU assets arising from entering into new operating lease obligations ​ $ 310 (a) Includes short-term lease expense and variable lease costs, which were immaterial in the year ended December 31, 2019. The weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate for operating leases as of December 31, 2019 were 8 years and 3.9 %, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2019 were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ 2020 ​ $ 238 2021 ​ 197 2022 ​ 155 2023 ​ 115 2024 ​ 80 Thereafter ​ 353 Total future minimum lease payments – undiscounted ​ 1,138 Less: imputed interest ​ ( 178 ) Present value of lease liabilities ​ $ 960 ​ The following table summarizes the amounts and location of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) December 31, 2019 Balance Sheet Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Lease - ROU Asset ​ $ 934 Deferred income taxes and other assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Lease Liability: ​ Current ​ $ 205 Other accrued liabilities Non-current ​ 755 Post-employment obligations and other long-term liabilities Total Liability ​ $ 960 ​ 69 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 12 — Leases (Continued) Leases where Abbott is the Lessor Certain assets, primarily diagnostics instruments, are leased to customers under contractual arrangements that typically include an operating or sales-type lease as well as performance obligations for reagents and other consumables. Sales-type leases are not significant. Contract terms vary by customer and may include options to terminate the contract or options to extend the contract. Where instruments are provided under operating lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g., reagent) sales. The allocation of revenue between the lease and non-lease components is based on stand-alone selling prices. Operating lease revenue represented less than 3 percent of Abbott’s total net sales in the year ended December 31, 2019. Assets related to operating leases are reported within Net property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $ 2.8 billion and $ 1.2 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Note 13 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 6.8 billion at December 31, 2019, and $ 5.1 billion at December 31, 2018, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2019 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Abbott held gross notional amounts of $ 9.1 billion and $ 13.6 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. In November 2019, Abbott borrowed ¥ 59.8 billion under a 5 -year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. From the date of the borrowing through December 31, 2019, the value of this long-term debt decreased approximately $ 4 million to $ 546 million due to foreign exchange rate changes. The change in the value was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. In March 2017, Abbott repaid its $ 479 million yen-denominated short-term debt which was designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary. At December 31, 2016, the value of this short-term debt was $ 454 million and changes in the fair value of the debt up through the date of repayment due to changes in exchange rates were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. In October 2018, Abbott unwound approximately $ 1.1 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 3.40 % Note due in 2023 and the 3.75 % Note due in 2026. As a part of the unwinding, Abbott paid approximately $ 90 million in cash, which was included in the Financing Activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in 2018. ​ 70 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) In the second quarter of 2017, Abbott unwound approximately $ 1.5 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 2.00 % Note due in 2020 and the 2.55 % Note due in 2022. The proceeds received were not significant.

These amounts are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line. The interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The hedged debt is marked to market, offsetting the effect of marking the interest rate swaps to market. ​ 71 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 13 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of December 31 are shown in the table below. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions. Abbott does not expect any losses from nonperformance by these counterparties. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2019 ​ 2018 ​ ​ Carrying ​ Fair ​ Carrying ​ Fair (in millions) Value Value Value Value Long-term Investment Securities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 836 ​ $ 836 ​ $ 856 ​ $ 856 Other ​ 47 ​ 47 ​ 41 ​ 41 Total Long-term debt ​ ( 17,938 ) ​ ( 20,772 ) ​ ( 19,366 ) ​ ( 19,871 ) Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Receivable position ​ 148 ​ 148 ​ 114 ​ 114 (Payable) position ​ ( 89 ) ​ ( 89 ) ​ ( 95 ) ​ ( 95 ) Interest Rate Hedge Contracts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Receivable position ​ 48 ​ 48 ​ — ​ — (Payable) position ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ ( 100 ) ​ ​ ( 100 ) ​ The fair value of the debt was determined based on significant other observable inputs, including current interest rates.

The fair value of the debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. Contingent consideration relates to businesses acquired by Abbott. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on an independent appraisal adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. The maximum amount for certain contingent consideration is not determinable as it is based on a percent of certain sales. Excluding such contingent consideration, the maximum amount estimated to be due is approximately $ 470 million, which is dependent upon attaining certain sales thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events, such as regulatory approvals. Note 14 — Litigation and Environmental Matters Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 95 million to $ 130 million. The recorded accrual balance at December 31, 2019 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 110 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. 73 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15 — Post-Employment Benefits Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution and medical and dental plans.

For plans where the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligations, the projected benefit obligations and the aggregate plan assets were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2019 2018 Accumulated benefit obligation ​ $ 1,985 ​ $ 1,265 Projected benefit obligation ​ 2,266 ​ 1,362 Fair value of plan assets ​ 821 ​ 375 ​ 74 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) The components of the net periodic benefit cost were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical and ​ ​ Defined Benefit Plans ​ Dental Plans (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Service cost — benefits earned during the year ​ $ 250 ​ $ 293 ​ $ 283 ​ $ 23 ​ $ 26 ​ $ 25 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations ​ 337 ​ 308 ​ 287 ​ 52 ​ 48 ​ 45 Expected return on plans’ assets ​ ( 710 ) ​ ( 680 ) ​ ( 613 ) ​ ( 27 ) ​ ( 33 ) ​ ( 33 ) Amortization of actuarial losses ​ 132 ​ 205 ​ 163 ​ 22 ​ 33 ​ 23 Amortization of prior service cost (credits) ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ ( 32 ) ​ ( 45 ) ​ ( 45 ) Total net cost ​ $ 10 ​ $ 127 ​ $ 121 ​ $ 38 ​ $ 29 ​ $ 15 ​ In 2017, Abbott recognized a $ 10 million curtailment gain related to the sale of AMO. Other comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year includes the amortization of actuarial losses and prior service costs (credits) as noted in the previous table. Other comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year also includes: net actuarial losses of $ 944 million for defined benefit plans and a loss of $ 190 million for medical and dental plans in 2019; net actuarial losses of $ 86 million for defined benefit plans and a gain of $ 53 million for medical and dental plans in 2018; net actuarial losses of $ 247 million for defined benefit plans and $ 97 million for medical and dental plans in 2017. The change in net actuarial losses in 2019 primarily relates to lower discount rates at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018, partially offset by the impact of actual 2019 asset returns in excess of expected returns. The pretax amount of actuarial losses and prior service cost (credits) included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2019 that is expected to be recognized in the net periodic benefit cost in 2020 is $ 253 million and $ 1 million of expense, respectively, for defined benefit pension plans and $ 32 million of expense and $ 28 million of income, respectively, for medical and dental plans. The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2019 2018 2017 Discount rate 3.0 % 4.0 % 3.4 % Expected aggregate average long-term change in compensation 4.3 % 4.3 % 4.4 % ​ The weighted average assumptions used to determine the net cost for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2019 2018 2017 Discount rate 4.0 % 3.4 % 3.9 % Expected return on plan assets 7.5 % 7.7 % 7.6 % Expected aggregate average long-term change in compensation 4.3 % 4.4 % 4.3 % ​ The assumed health care cost trend rates for medical and dental plans at December 31 were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2019 2018 2017 Health care cost trend rate assumed for the next year 9 % 9 % 9 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to 5 % 5 % 5 % Year that rate reaches the assumed ultimate rate 2025 ​ 2025 ​ 2027 ​ ​ ​ 75 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott’s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are forward projections of health care costs as of the measurement date. A one-percentage point increase/(decrease) in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase/(decrease) the accumulated post-employment benefit obligations as of December 31, 2019, by $ 221 million /$( 179 ) million, and the total of the service and interest cost components of net post-employment health care cost for the year then ended by approximately $ 12 million/$( 9 ) million.

Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. For approximately half of these funds, investments may be redeemed once per month, with a required 7 to 30 day notice period. For the remaining funds, daily redemption of an investment is allowed. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry recognized vendors. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to fixed income funds at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Fixed income securities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. For the majority of these funds, investments may be redeemed either weekly or monthly, with a required 2 to 14 day notice period. For the remaining funds, investments may be generally redeemed daily. Absolute return funds and commodities are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. All private funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund on a one-quarter lag adjusted for known cash flows and significant events through the reporting date. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to absolute return funds at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Investments in these funds may be generally redeemed monthly or quarterly with required notice periods ranging from 5 to 90 days . For approximately $ 235 million and $ 100 million of the absolute return funds, redemptions are subject to a 33 percent gate and a 25 percent gate, respectively, and $ 45 million is subject to a lock until 2022. For commodities, investments in the private energy funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2020 to 2022. Abbott’s unfunded commitments in these funds as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not significant. Investments in the private funds (excluding private energy funds) cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2020 to 2029. Abbott’s unfunded commitment in these funds was $ 571 million and $ 518 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. ​ 77 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, as well as balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities with lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The plans do not directly hold any securities of Abbott. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plans’ assets. Abbott’s medical and dental plans’ assets are invested in a similar mix as the pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation percentages at year end are consistent with the company’s targeted asset allocation percentages. The plans’ expected return on assets, as shown above is based on management’s expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. Abbott funds its domestic pension plans according to IRS funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. Abbott funded $ 382 million in 2019 and $ 114 million in 2018 to defined pension plans. Abbott expects to contribute approximately $ 387 million to its pension plans in 2020. Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which includes payments funded from company assets, as well as paid from the plans, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined ​ Medical and (in millions) Benefit Plans Dental Plans 2020 ​ $ 315 ​ $ 76 2021 ​ 325 ​ 78 2022 ​ 342 ​ 79 2023 ​ 360 ​ 80 2024 ​ 382 ​ 82 2025 to 2029 ​ 2,219 ​ 421 ​ The Abbott Stock Retirement Plan is the principal defined contribution plan. Abbott’s contributions to this plan were $ 158 million in 2019, $ 146 million in 2018 and $ 79 million in 2017. The 2018 contributions include amounts related to participants of the St. Jude Medical Retirement Plan which was terminated in January 2018. Note 16 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the annual effective rates, including charges for interest and penalties. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 %, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2018, Abbott completed its accounting for all of the enactment date income tax effects of the TCJA. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, the TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. In January 2018, the FASB staff provided guidance that an entity may make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes related to items that will give rise to GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year that the tax is incurred. Abbott has elected to treat the GILTI tax as a period expense and provide for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. ​ 78 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued) In the fourth quarter of 2017, Abbott recorded an estimate of net tax expense of $ 1.46 billion for the impact of the TCJA, which was included in Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The estimate was provisional and included a charge of approximately $ 2.89 billion for the transition tax, partially offset by a net benefit of approximately $ 1.42 billion for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a net benefit of approximately $ 10 million related to certain other impacts of the TCJA. In 2018, Abbott recorded $ 130 million of additional tax expense which increased the final tax expense related to the TCJA to $ 1.59 billion. The $ 130 million of additional tax expense reflects a $ 120 million increase in the transition tax from $ 2.89 billion to $ 3.01 billion and a $ 10 million reduction in the net benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include an $ 86 million reduction to the transition tax. The $ 86 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in 2019. This adjustment decreased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $ 1.50 billion. The one-time transition tax is based on Abbott’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 E&P considered held in cash and other specified assets. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining balance of Abbott’s transition tax obligation is approximately $ 1.33 billion, which will be paid over the next seven years as allowed by the TCJA. In 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included $ 68 million of tax expense resulting from tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India. In 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included $ 98 million of net tax expense related to the settlement of Abbott’s 2014-2016 federal income tax audit in the U.S., partial settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group’s 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in the U.S. and audit settlements in various countries. In 2017, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include $ 435 million of tax expense related to the gain on the sale of the AMO business. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2015 and the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. There are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which are individually significant. Reserves for interest and penalties are not significant. Earnings from continuing operations before taxes, and the related provisions for taxes on earnings from continuing operations, were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Taxes: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Domestic ​ $ 889 ​ $ ( 430 ) ​ $ 308 Foreign ​ 3,188 ​ 3,303 ​ 1,923 Total ​ $ 4,077 ​ $ 2,873 ​ $ 2,231 ​ 79 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Taxes on Earnings From Continuing Operations: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Current: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Domestic ​ $ 291 ​ $ ( 812 ) ​ $ 2,260 Foreign ​ 590 ​ 606 ​ 508 Total current ​ 881 ​ ( 206 ) ​ 2,768 Deferred: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Domestic ​ ( 305 ) ​ 832 ​ ( 679 ) Foreign ​ ( 186 ) ​ ( 87 ) ​ ( 211 ) Total deferred ​ ( 491 ) ​ 745 ​ ( 890 ) Total ​ $ 390 ​ $ 539 ​ $ 1,878 ​ Differences between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2019 2018 2017 Statutory tax rate on earnings from continuing operations 21.0 % 21.0 % 35.0 % Impact of foreign operations ( 5.0 ) ​ ( 5.4 ) ​ ( 16.3 ) ​ Impact of TCJA and other related items ​ ( 2.1 ) ​ 6.3 ​ 65.5 ​ Foreign-derived intangible income benefit ​ ( 2.0 ) ​ ( 1.9 ) ​ — ​ Domestic impairment loss ​ — ​ ( 2.1 ) ​ — ​ Excess tax benefits related to stock compensation ​ ( 2.5 ) ​ ( 3.1 ) ​ ( 5.4 ) ​ Research tax credit ​ ( 1.2 ) ​ ( 1.8 ) ​ ( 1.9 ) ​ Resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years — ​ 3.4 ​ — ​ State taxes, net of federal benefit 0.8 ​ 0.4 ​ 0.5 ​ Federal tax cost on sale of Mylan N.V. shares ​ — ​ — ​ 3.4 ​ All other, net 0.6 ​ 2.0 ​ 3.4 ​ Effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations 9.6 % 18.8 % 84.2 % ​ Impact of foreign operations is primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, and Singapore. ​ 80 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16 — Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued) The tax effect of the differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2019 2018 Deferred tax assets: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Compensation and employee benefits $ 982 $ 829 Other, primarily reserves not currently deductible, and NOL’s and credit carryforwards ​ ​ 2,227 ​ ​ 2,546 Trade receivable reserves ​ ​ 190 ​ ​ 196 Inventory reserves ​ ​ 110 ​ ​ 97 Lease liabilities ​ ​ 209 ​ ​ — Deferred intercompany profit ​ ​ 259 ​ ​ 203 Total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance ​ ​ 3,977 ​ ​ 3,871 Valuation allowance ​ ​ ( 978 ) ​ ​ ( 1,363 ) Total deferred tax assets ​ ​ 2,999 ​ ​ 2,508 Deferred tax liabilities: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Depreciation ​ ​ ( 219 ) ​ ​ ( 226 ) Right of Use lease assets ​ ​ ( 209 ) ​ ​ — Other, primarily the excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets ​ ​ ( 3,107 ) ​ ​ ( 3,557 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ​ ​ ( 3,535 ) ​ ​ ( 3,783 ) Total net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ ( 536 ) $ ( 1,275 ) ​ ​ Abbott has incurred losses in a foreign jurisdiction where realization of the future economic benefit is so remote that the benefit is not reflected as a deferred tax asset. The following table summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such unrecognized tax benefits were settled: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) 2019 2018 January 1 ​ $ 1,120 ​ $ 1,440 Decrease in tax positions due to acquisitions ​ ​ — ​ ​ ( 13 ) Increase due to current year tax positions ​ 137 ​ 164 Increase due to prior year tax positions ​ 75 ​ 235 Decrease due to prior year tax positions ​ ( 117 ) ​ ( 611 ) Settlements ​ ( 32 ) ​ ( 91 ) Lapse of statute ​ ​ ( 8 ) ​ ​ ( 4 ) December 31 ​ $ 1,175 ​ $ 1,120 ​ The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is approximately $ 1.07 billion. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within a range of $ 220 million to $ 510 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. ​ 81 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 17 — Segment and Geographic Area Information Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, the results of the Diabetes Care business, which had previously been included in Other, were aggregated with the results of the businesses in the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation segment to comprise the Medical Devices reportable segment. Historic periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. On October 3, 2017, Abbott completed the acquisition of Alere. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017, Abbott’s Diagnostic Products reportable segment includes the results of Alere from the date of acquisition. Abbott’s reportable segments are as follows: Established Pharmaceutical Products —International sales of a broad line of branded generic pharmaceutical products. Nutritional Products —Worldwide sales of a broad line of adult and pediatric nutritional products. Diagnostic Products —Worldwide sales of diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and alternate-care testing sites. For segment reporting purposes, the Core Laboratories Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care divisions are aggregated and reported as the Diagnostic Products segment. Rapid Diagnostics is the business acquired from Alere. Medical Devices — Worldwide sales of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care products. For segment reporting purposes, the Cardiac Arrhythmias & Heart Failure, Vascular, Neuromodulation, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care divisions are aggregated and reported as the Medical Devices segment. Non-reportable segments include AMO through the date of its sale in February 2017. Abbott's underlying accounting records are maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting requirements. Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost.

Abbott’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Abbott’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2019, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. Abbott’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 90. Miles D. White Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Brian B. Yoor Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Robert E. Funck, Jr. Senior Vice President, Finance and Controller February 21, 2020 ​ 86 ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders’ investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 87 ​ ​ ​ Evaluation of acquired in-process research & development intangible assets Description of the Matter ​ As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, acquired in-process research & development (“IPR&D”) intangible assets were approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019. IPR&D intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators suggest the fair value of the IPR&D intangible asset may be below its carrying value. Auditing the fair value estimate of IPR&D intangible assets is complex because the estimate involves making assumptions about the timing and amount of forecasted future net cash flows of the related IPR&D projects, as well as the risk associated with the forecasted future net cash flows. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit ​ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s IPR&D intangible asset impairment assessment, as well as its process for identification of events that indicate an IPR&D intangible asset may be impaired. This included controls over management's review of the valuation model and the significant assumptions (e.g., discount rate, projected research and development (“R&D”) costs, probability of technical success, projected revenues and product profitability) used to develop the prospective financial information (PFI). To test the fair value of the Company’s IPR&D intangible assets, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company's use of the income approach, testing the significant assumptions described above used to develop the prospective financial information and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, historical results of the Company's business and other guideline companies within the same industry and to other relevant factors. We performed a sensitivity analysis of the significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the IPR&D assets resulting from changes in the assumptions. We also involved our valuation specialists to assist in testing certain significant assumptions in the fair value estimate. In addition, to evaluate the probability of technical success, we considered the phase of development of the IPR&D project and the Company's history of obtaining regulatory approvals. ​ ​ ​ Income taxes – Unrecognized tax benefits Description of the Matter ​ As described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Unrecognized tax benefits are assessed by management quarterly for identification and measurement, or more frequently if there are any indicators suggesting change in unrecognized tax benefits. Assessing tax positions involves judgement including interpreting tax laws of multiple jurisdictions and assumptions relevant to the measurement of an unrecognized tax benefit, including the estimated amount of tax liability that may be incurred should the tax position not be sustained upon inspection by a tax authority. These judgements and assumptions can significantly affect unrecognized tax benefits. 88 ​ How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit ​ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s identification and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, as well as its process for the assessment of events that may indicate a change in unrecognized tax benefits is warranted. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the completeness of identified unrecognized tax benefits, as well as controls over management’s review of significant assumptions used within the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits. With the support of our tax professionals and valuation specialists, among other audit procedures performed, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s judgement with respect to the interpretation of tax laws of multiple jurisdictions by reading and evaluating management’s documentation, including relevant accounting policies, and by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, affected management’s judgments. We tested the completeness of management’s assessment of the identification of unrecognized tax benefits and possible outcomes related to it including evaluation of technical merits of the unrecognized tax benefits. We also tested appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and significant assumptions associated with the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits, including assessing the estimated amount of tax liability that may be incurred should the tax position not be sustained upon inspection by a tax authority. ​ /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. Chicago, Illinois February 21, 2020 ​ 89 ​ Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders’ investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 21, 2020 90 ​ ITEM 9.

The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2009 Program may be issued in connection with any one of these benefits and may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards are satisfied from treasury shares). ​ ​ ​ 92 ​ ​ ​ If there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 2009 Program without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program (the “2017 Program”). If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2009 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2009 Program. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ In April 2017, the 2009 Program was replaced by the 2017 Program. No further awards will be granted under the 2009 Program. ​ ​ ​ ​ (ii) Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program . Benefits under the 2017 Program include non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, other share-based awards (including stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and recognition awards), awards to non-employee directors, and foreign benefits. The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2017 Program may be issued in connection with any one of these benefits and may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards are satisfied from treasury shares). ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ If there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 2017 Program without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program. If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2017 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2017 Program. ​ ​ ​ ​ (iii) Abbott Laboratories Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees . Eligible employees of participating non-U.S. affiliates of Abbott may participate in this plan. An eligible employee may authorize payroll deductions at the rate of 1% to 10% of eligible compensation (in multiples of one percent) subject to a limit of US $12,500 during any purchase cycle. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Purchase cycles are generally six months long and usually begin on August 1 and February 1. On the last day of each purchase cycle, Abbott uses participant contributions to acquire Abbott common shares. The shares may be either authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares acquired on the open market. The purchase price is typically 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date or on the first day of that purchase cycle. As the number of shares subject to outstanding options is indeterminable, columns (a) and (b) of the above table do not include information on the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2019, an aggregate of 12,650,941 common shares were available for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, including shares subject to purchase during the current purchase cycle. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ In April 2017, the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees was amended and restated as the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees. ​ ​ ​ (2) ​ Not included in the table: St. Jude Medical, Inc.

The Proxy Statement will be filed on or about March 15, 2019. PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS Abbott Laboratories is an Illinois corporation, incorporated in 1900. Abbott's* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products. On October 3, 2017, Abbott completed the acquisition of Alere, Inc., a diagnostic device and service provider, for an aggregate consideration of approximately $4.5 billion in cash. On February 27, 2017, Abbott completed the sale of Abbott Medical Optics, its vision care business, to Johnson & Johnson for $4.325 billion in cash. On January 4, 2017, Abbott completed the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc., a global medical device manufacturer. Based on the closing Abbott share price on January 4, 2017, the aggregate implied value of the consideration paid in connection with the acquisition was approximately $23.6 billion, including approximately $13.6 billion in cash and approximately $10 billion in Abbott common shares. Established Pharmaceutical Products These products include a broad line of branded generic pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide and marketed and sold outside the United States in emerging markets. These products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with, or licensed from, other companies. The principal products included in the broad therapeutic area portfolios of the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment are: 1 The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment directs its primary marketing efforts toward building a strong brand with key stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Government agencies are also important customers. Competition in the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is generally from other health care and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors may increase competitive pressures. Diagnostic Products These products include a broad line of diagnostic systems and tests manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, clinics, physicians' offices, government agencies, alternate care testing sites, and plasma protein therapeutic companies from Abbott owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors. The principal products included in the Diagnostic Products segment are: The Diagnostic Products segment's products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, instrument warranty provisions, product performance, laboratory efficiency, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. 2 Nutritional Products These products include a broad line of pediatric and adult nutritional products manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to consumers and to institutions, wholesalers, retailers, health care facilities, government agencies, and third-party distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers or third-party distributors. The principal products included in the Nutritional Products segment are: Primary marketing efforts for nutritional products are directed toward consumers or to securing the recommendation of Abbott's brand of products by physicians or other health care professionals. In addition, certain nutritional products sold as Similac®, Gain, Grow, Eleva, PediaSure®, PediaSure SideKicks®, Pedialyte®, Ensure®, Zone Perfect®, and Glucerna® are also promoted directly to the public by consumer marketing efforts in select markets where appropriate. Competition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers' products may increase competitive pressure. Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products These products include a broad line of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. These products are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, these products are generally marketed and sold directly to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and physicians' offices from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. The principal products included in the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment are: 3 mapping system; Confirm Rx® implantable cardiac monitor; and the Advisor® HD Grid mapping catheter; The Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment's products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, product performance, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products. Other Products The principal products in Abbott's other businesses include continuous glucose and blood glucose monitoring systems, including test strips, sensors, data management decision software, and accessories for people with diabetes, under the FreeStyle® brand such as the FreeStyle Libre® system. These products are marketed worldwide and generally sold directly to wholesalers, government agencies, private health care organizations, health care facilities, mail order pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Some of these products are also marketed and distributed through distributors. Blood and continuous glucose monitoring systems are also marketed and sold to consumers. These products are subject to regulatory changes and competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, and product performance. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ABBOTT'S BUSINESS IN GENERAL Sources and Availability of Raw Materials Abbott purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to Abbott's operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and around the world. There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies. Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses Abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products. Accordingly, where possible, patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for Abbott's products in the United States 4 and countries of interest to Abbott. Abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications. Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 through 4. These, and various patents which expire during the period 2019 to 2039, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Abbott's business. Abbott believes that no single patent, license, or trademark is material in relation to Abbott's business as a whole. Seasonal Aspects, Customers, Backlog, and Renegotiation There are no significant seasonal aspects to Abbott's business. Abbott has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on Abbott. Orders for Abbott's products are generally filled on a current basis, and order backlog is not material to Abbott's business. No material portion of Abbott's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government. Environmental Matters Abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. Abbott's capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2018 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2019. Abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which are owned by Abbott, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, Abbott believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Employees Abbott employed approximately 103,000 people as of December 31, 2018. Regulation The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar international regulatory agencies. Government regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott's products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott's clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections. 5 Abbott's international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott's investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products. Abbott's home monitoring services and related products and laboratories that provide Abbott and third-party medical devices to consumers in the United States are subject to additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to third-party payors. Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria. Abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions, including suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory's certification, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties. Abbott's business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in many countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. Abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products. Many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, or coverage limitations. Budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on Abbott's products for the foreseeable future. In the United States, the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices, diagnostics, supplies, and other products, as well as the procedures in which these products may be used. The government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home, and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Other payment methodology changes have been proposed and 6 implemented from time to time. For example, Medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment (including diabetes products), enteral nutrition products, and supplies. Additionally, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act establishes a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests, which became effective on January 1, 2018. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), imposed an excise tax on Abbott and other medical device manufacturers and importers. The excise tax was subsequently suspended from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. In January 2018, the excise tax was suspended for an additional two years. The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. In October 2018, the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required, beginning with reports filed in 2022. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. Policy changes, including potential modification or repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act, or implementation of new health care legislation, could result in significant changes to the health care system. The regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information (including patient health information and financial information), is increasing. For example, the European Union has enacted stricter data protection laws, which took effect in 2018, that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices. In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering ""data localization"" laws, which limit companies' ability to transfer protected data across country borders. Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties. Transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended, and Abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area. Governmental cost containment efforts also affect Abbott's nutritional products business. In the United States, for example, under regulations governing the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula. As a result, through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program. Abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, manufacture, availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services, as well as data privacy and security. Abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical, nutrition, diagnostic, and medical device industries, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. 7 INTERNET INFORMATION Copies of Abbott's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through Abbott's investor relations website ( www.abbottinvestor.com ) as soon as reasonably practicable after Abbott electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports and other information are also available, free of charge, at www.sec.gov. Abbott's corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of Abbott's audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy committee are all available on Abbott's investor relations website ( www.abbottinvestor.com ). 8 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability. Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity. Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income. In the United States and other countries, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned ""Regulation."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. Abbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, or diagnostic product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs. In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution. 9 These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future. Abbott's industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott's business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott's business. Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to our products' coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott's products or the prices that Abbott's customers are willing to pay for them. Further, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services and establish certain fees for the medical device industry. These provisions may be modified, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law. For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in ""Regulation"" under Item 1, ""Business."" Abbott has incurred and assumed significant indebtedness, which has increased consolidated interest expense and could decrease business flexibility. Abbott incurred and assumed significant indebtedness in connection with the 2017 acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere. As of December 31, 2018, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $19.6 billion. This consolidated indebtedness increased Abbott's consolidated interest expense and could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Further, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. 10 Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition. Additionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility. Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's results of operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott's information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties. Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in ""Regulation"" under Item 1, ""Business."" A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties. Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Any significant attack or other disruption on Abbott's systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business. The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott's future revenues and operating income. Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott's intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott's intellectual property rights, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott's patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned ""Legal Proceedings."" 11 Competitors' intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition. Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition. Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested. Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott's products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott's revenues and operating results to suffer. New products and technological advances by Abbott's competitors may negatively affect Abbott's results of operations. Abbott's products face intense competition from its competitors' products. Competitors' products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott's products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors' products. The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott's business could suffer. The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, 12 similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott's products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and financial condition. Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott's products. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition. Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and Abbott's ability to realize projected sales and earnings. Although Abbott's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott's revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2018 made up approximately 65 percent of Abbott's net sales. Abbott's profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott's assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks. Information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott's financial results is contained in the ""Financial Review  Results of Operations"" section in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott's 2018 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott's hedging arrangements is contained in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this report. Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott's results of operations. Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of 13 sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott's collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott's receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott's customers depend on payment by government health care systems. The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2018 made up approximately 65 percent of Abbott's net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott's international operations include: Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition. Many other factors can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition, including: 14 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates, and projections. Words such as ""expects,"" ""anticipates,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""believes,"" ""seeks,"" ""estimates,"" ""forecasts,"" variations of these words, and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Certain factors, including but not limited to those identified under ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" of this Form 10-K, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, estimates, projections, forecasts, and from past results. No assurance can be made that any expectation, estimate, or projection contained in a forward-looking statement will be achieved or will not be affected by the factors cited above or other future events. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as the result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 15 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2018, Abbott owned or leased properties totaling approximately 42 million square feet, of which approximately 70% is owned by Abbott. Abbott's principal corporate offices are located in Illinois and are owned by Abbott. Abbott operates 94 manufacturing facilities globally. Abbott's facilities are deemed suitable and provide adequate productive capacity. The manufacturing facilities are used by Abbott's reportable segments as follows: Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products Diagnostic Products Established Pharmaceutical Products Nutritional Products Non-Reportable Worldwide Total Abbott's research and development facilities in the United States are primarily located in California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Ohio. Abbott also has research and development facilities in various other countries, including China, Colombia, India, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. There are no material encumbrances on the properties. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Abbott is involved in various claims, legal proceedings and investigations. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 16 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Executive officers of Abbott are elected annually by the board of directors.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Principal Market The principal market for Abbott's common shares is the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""ABT."" Shares are also listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange and traded on various regional and electronic exchanges. Outside the United States, Abbott's shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Shareholders There were 42,827 shareholders of record of Abbott common shares as of December 31, 2018. Tax Information for Shareholders In 2001, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity designated Abbott as an Illinois High Impact Business (HIB) for a period not to exceed twenty years. Dividends paid by a corporation that is designated as a HIB and conducts business in a foreign trade zone may be eligible for a subtraction from base income for Illinois income tax purposes. Abbott certified that the HIB requirements were met for the calendar year ending December 31, 2018. If you have any questions, please contact your tax advisor. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities October 1, 2018  October 31, 2018 November 1, 2018  November 30, 2018 December 1, 2018  December 31, 2018 Total These shares do not include the shares surrendered to Abbott to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units. 21 ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Net sales (1) Earnings from continuing operations (1) Net earnings Basic earnings per common share from continuing operations (1) Basic earnings per common share Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations (1) Diluted earnings per common share Total assets Long-term debt, including current portion Cash dividends declared per common share 22 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review Abbott's revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott's products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott's primary products are cardiovascular and neuromodulation products, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. Sales in international markets comprise approximately 65 percent of consolidated net sales. Over the last several years, Abbott proactively shaped the company with the strategic intent to deliver sustainable growth in all of its businesses. Significant steps over the last three years included: The sales increase over the last three years reflects both the 2017 acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere and volume growth across Abbott's businesses, most notably in the Established Pharmaceuticals, Diabetes Care and Diagnostics businesses. Volume growth reflects the introduction of new products as well as higher sales of existing products. In 2017, the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere, partially offset by the sale of AMO, contributed 26.5 percentage points of Abbott's total sales growth versus 2016. Sales in emerging markets, which represent approximately 40 percent of total company sales, increased 12.3 percent in 2018 and 13.9 percent in 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. (Emerging markets include all countries except the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.) Over the last three years, Abbott's operating margin was positively impacted by margin improvements across various businesses, including Established Pharmaceuticals, Core Laboratory, and Diabetes Care, partially offset by higher amortization and other costs associated with the acquisitions. In 2018, Abbott's operating margin increased by approximately 6 percentage points primarily due to operating margin improvement in various businesses and lower inventory step-up amortization and integration costs associated with the acquisitions, partially offset by higher intangible amortization. In 2017, Abbott's 23 operating margin decreased by approximately 9 percentage points primarily due to costs associated with the acquisitions, including higher intangible amortization expense, inventory step-up amortization and integration costs, partially offset by operating margin improvement in various businesses. Since the beginning of the first quarter of 2017, the results of Abbott's Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment include Abbott's historical Vascular Products segment and St. Jude Medical from the date of acquisition. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment increased 4.9 percent in 2018 and 207.4 percent in 2017. The sales increase in 2018 was driven primarily by higher Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, and Neuromodulation sales. The sales increase in 2017 was driven by the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment were essentially unchanged in 2017 versus the prior year. In 2017, higher structural heart and endovascular sales were offset by lower coronary stent sales and the comparison impact from the favorable 2016 resolution of a third-party royalty agreement in Abbott's vascular business. In 2018, operating earnings for this segment increased 9.9 percent. The operating margin profile declined from 35.8 percent of sales in 2016 to 31.7 percent in 2018 primarily due to the mix of business resulting from the acquisition of St. Jude Medical and ongoing pricing pressures in the coronary business. Cost improvement initiatives contributed to an improvement in the operating margin profile from 30.5 percent in 2017 to 31.7 percent in 2018. In 2018, the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment received approval or clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the following products: In Abbott's worldwide diagnostics business, sales growth over the last three years reflected the acquisition of Alere in October 2017, as well as continued market penetration by the core laboratory business in the U.S. and internationally. Alere's results are included in Abbott's Diagnostic Products reportable segment from the date of acquisition. Worldwide diagnostic sales increased 33.6 percent in 2018 and 16.7 percent in 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of the Alere acquisition, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the Diagnostic Products segment increased 6.5 percent in 2018 and 5.5 percent in 2017. This growth includes the continued roll-out of Alinity®, which is Abbott's integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems and solutions that are designed to increase efficiency by running more tests in less space, generating test results faster and minimizing human errors while continuing to provide quality results. Abbott has regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, China, and other markets for the ""Alinity c"" and ""Alinity i"" instruments for clinical chemistry and immunoassay diagnostics, respectively. In 2018, Abbott accelerated the launch of Alinity in Europe and other international markets after a broad range of assays obtained regulatory approval and were added to the test menu. Abbott also continued the roll-out of ""Alinity s"" for blood and plasma screening. Margin improvement continued to be a key focus for the Diagnostics business in 2018 and 2017. While operating margins of 24.9 percent of sales in 2018 have remained relatively unchanged from the 24.8 percent of sales reported in 2016, this reflects dilution to the operating margin profit from the 24 acquisition of Alere and the negative impact of foreign exchange, offset by the continued execution of efficiency initiatives in the manufacturing and supply chain functions. In Abbott's worldwide nutritional products business, sales over the last three years were positively impacted by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets, as well as by numerous new product introductions that leveraged Abbott's strong brands. In 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the nutritional business experienced above-market growth in the worldwide pediatric business driven by market leading brands Similac® and Pedialyte® in the U.S. as well as growth across several markets in Asia. Worldwide, adult nutrition sales increased in 2018 led by the growth of Ensure®, Abbott's market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna®, Abbott's market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand. In 2017, the nutritionals business experienced growth in the U.S. driven by above-market performance in Abbott's infant and toddler brands. Internationally, 2017 sales growth in China and India was partially offset by challenging market conditions in the infant formula market in various emerging markets. With respect to the profitability of the nutritional products business, manufacturing and distribution process changes, as well as other cost reductions, drove margin improvements across the business over the last three years although such improvements were offset by inflation on commodity costs. The decrease in operating margins for this business from 24.1 percent of sales in 2016 to 22.9 percent in 2018 was primarily due to negative impact of foreign exchange. The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment focuses on the sale of its products in emerging markets. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, Established Pharmaceutical sales increased 7.0 percent in 2018 and 9.5 percent in 2017. The sales increase in 2018 was driven by double-digit growth in India and China. The sales increase in 2017 was primarily driven by double-digit growth in China and various countries in Latin America. Operating margins increased from 18.7 percent of sales in 2016 to 20.2 percent in 2018 primarily due to the continued focus on cost reduction initiatives. In its diabetes business, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for its FreeStyle Libre® 14 day sensor, making it the longest lasting wearable glucose sensor available. The FreeStyle Libre system is the only continuous glucose monitoring system that does not require any user calibration. In conjunction with the funding of the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions and the assumption of St. Jude Medical's and Alere's existing debt, Abbott's total short-term and long-term debt increased from approximately $9.0 billion at December 31, 2015 to $27.9 billion at December 31, 2017. At the beginning of 2018, Abbott committed to reducing its debt levels and in 2018 Abbott repaid approximately $8.3 billion of debt, net of borrowings, bringing its total debt to $19.6 billion. Abbott declared dividends of $1.16 per share in 2018 compared to $1.075 per share in 2017, an increase of approximately 8 percent. Dividends paid totaled $1.974 billion in 2018 compared to $1.849 billion in 2017. The year-over-year change in the amount of dividends paid reflects the increase in the dividend rate. In December 2018, Abbott increased the company's quarterly dividend by approximately 14 percent to $0.32 per share from $0.28 per share, effective with the dividend paid in February 2019. In 2019, Abbott will focus on continuing to invest in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth over the next several years. In its diagnostics business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving market adoption and geographic expansion of its Alinity suite of diagnostics instruments. In the cardiovascular and neuromodulation business, Abbott will continue to focus on expanding its market position in various areas including electrophysiology, heart failure, and structural heart. In its nutritionals business, Abbott will continue to focus on driving growth globally and further enhancing its portfolio with the introduction of several new science-based products. In the established pharmaceuticals business, Abbott will continue to focus on growing its business with the depth and breadth 25 of its portfolio in emerging markets. In its diabetes care business, Abbott will focus on driving continued market adoption of its FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring system. Critical Accounting Policies Sales Rebates  In 2018, approximately 45 percent of Abbott's consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that Abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale. Most of these rebates and allowances in 2018 are in the Nutritional Products and Diabetes Care segments. Abbott provides rebates to state agencies that administer the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and other government agencies and private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016 amounted to approximately $3.0 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, or 19.0 percent, 20.5 percent and 22.9 percent of gross sales, respectively, based on gross sales of approximately $16.0 billion, $13.9 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively, subject to rebate. A one-percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately $160 million in 2018. Abbott considers a one-percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales. Other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately $175 million, $166 million and $160 million for cash discounts in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $191 million, $204 million and $242 million for returns in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott's historical returns are low, and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter. In the domestic nutritional business, management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the accruals. In the WIC business, estimates are required for the amount of WIC sales within each state where Abbott holds the WIC contract. The state where the sale is made, which is the determining factor for the applicable rebated price, is reliably determinable. Rebated prices are based on contractually obligated agreements generally lasting a period of two to four years. Except for a change in contract price or a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the WIC business in a state, accruals are based on historical redemption rates and data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the states submitting rebate claims. The USDA, which administers the WIC program, has been making its data available for many years. Management also estimates the states' processing lag time based on sales and claims data. Inventory in the retail distribution channel does not vary substantially. Management has access to several large customers' inventory management data, which allows management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the retail distribution channel. At December 31, 2018, Abbott had WIC business in 27 states. Historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. For government agency programs, the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation. 26 Income Taxes  Abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments. Because Abbott operates globally, the nature of the audit items is often very complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country. Abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible. In accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment. In the U.S., Abbott's federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2014 and the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. Pension and Post-Employment Benefits  Abbott offers pension benefits and post-employment health care to many of its employees. Abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott's expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date. A difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates, which will not be known for years, can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs. Low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans. At December 31, 2018, pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and (credits) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for Abbott's defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of $3.3 billion and $198 million, respectively. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method, in accordance with the rules for accounting for post-employment benefits. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five-year period. Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one-percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate; however, there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point. Valuation of Intangible Assets  Abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that Abbott records at fair value at the acquisition date. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. Abbott engages independent valuation experts who review Abbott's critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles. Abbott reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach. If the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value, which is usually the discounted cash flow amount. Where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset, the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs. At December 31, 2018, goodwill amounted to $23.3 billion and net intangibles amounted to $18.9 billion. Amortization expense in continuing operations for intangible assets amounted to $2.2 billion in 2018, $2.0 billion in 2017 and $550 million in 2016. There was no significant reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in 2018, 2017 and 2016. 27 Litigation  Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, ""Contingencies."" Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. Accordingly, Abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. Abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately $125 million to $165 million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures. Accruals of approximately $145 million have been recorded at December 31, 2018 for these proceedings and exposures. These accruals represent management's best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, ""Contingencies."" 28 Results of Operations Sales The following table details the components of sales growth by reportable segment for the last two years: Total Net Sales 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Total U.S. 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Total International 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Established Pharmaceutical Products Segment 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Nutritional Products Segment 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Diagnostic Products Segment 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products Segment 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 The increase in Total Net Sales in 2018 reflects the acquisition of Alere, as well as volume growth across all of Abbott's businesses. The increase in Total Net Sales in 2017 reflects the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere, as well as volume growth in the established pharmaceuticals and diagnostics businesses. The price declines related to the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment in 2018 and 2017 primarily reflect pricing pressure on drug eluting stents (DES) as a result of market competition in the U.S. and other major markets. 29 A comparison of significant product and product group sales is as follows. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. Total Established Pharmaceuticals  Key Emerging Markets Other Nutritionals  International Pediatric Nutritionals U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals International Adult Nutritionals U.S. Adult Nutritionals Diagnostics  Core Laboratory Molecular Point of Care Rapid Diagnostics Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation  Rhythm Management Electrophysiology Heart Failure Vascular Structural Heart Neuromodulation Total Established Pharmaceuticals  Key Emerging Markets Other Nutritionals  International Pediatric Nutritionals U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals International Adult Nutritionals U.S. Adult Nutritionals Diagnostics  Core Laboratory Molecular Point of Care Rapid Diagnostics Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation  Rhythm Management Electrophysiology Heart Failure Vascular Structural Heart Neuromodulation n/m = percent change is not meaningful. 30 Total Established Pharmaceutical Products sales increased 7.0 percent in 2018 and 9.5 percent in 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is focused on several key emerging markets including India, Russia, China and Brazil. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total sales in these key emerging markets increased 7.4 percent in 2018 and 11.9 percent in 2017. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, 2018 sales in India and China and 2017 sales in China and various countries in Latin America experienced double-digit growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales in Established Pharmaceuticals' other emerging markets increased 5.8 percent in 2018 and 2.2 percent in 2017. The 2017 sales growth for Established Pharmaceuticals' other emerging markets includes the unfavorable impact of Venezuelan operations. Excluding Venezuela and the effect of foreign exchange, sales in other emerging markets increased 7.5 percent in 2017. Total Nutritional Products sales increased 4.9 percent in 2018 and 0.6 percent in 2017, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. The increases in 2018 and 2017 U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales primarily reflect continued above-market performance in Abbott's infant and toddler brands, including Similac and Pedialyte. 2018 International Pediatric Nutritional sales increased primarily due to growth in Asia and Latin America. The 2017 decrease in International Pediatric Nutritional sales was driven by challenging market conditions in the infant formula market in various emerging markets, partially offset by growth in China and India. The 2018 sales increase in the International Adult Nutritional business was led by growth of Ensure, Abbott's market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna, Abbott's market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand in Asia and Latin America. U.S. Adult Nutritional business sales decreased in 2018 primarily driven by the wind down of a non-core product line. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, the 2017 increase in International Adult Nutritional sales was due primarily to growth in Ensure, as well as volume growth in emerging markets and continued expansion of the adult nutrition category internationally. U.S. Adult Nutritional revenues decreased in 2017 due to competitive and market dynamics. Total Diagnostic Products sales increased 33.6 percent in 2018 and 16.7 percent in 2017, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The sales increases in 2018 and 2017 included the acquisition of Alere, which was completed on October 3, 2017. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the Diagnostic Products segment in 2018 and 2017 increased 6.5 and 5.5 percent, respectively. The 2018 increase in sales was primarily driven by above-market growth in Core Laboratory in the U.S. and internationally. In 2018, Abbott accelerated the roll out of its Alinity systems for Core Laboratory in Europe. The 2017 increase in sales was primarily driven by share gains in the Core Laboratory markets globally, as well as performance in Point of Care led by the continued adoption of Abbott's i-STAT® handheld system. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products sales grew 4.9 percent in 2018. The 2018 sales increase was driven by growth in several areas, including double-digit growth in Electrophysiology and Structural Heart. The growth in Electrophysiology in 2018 was led by higher sales in cardiac mapping and ablation catheters, as well as the U.S. launch of Abbott's Confirm Rx® Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM), the world's first and only smartphone-compatible ICM designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias. In May 2018, Abbott announced U.S. FDA clearance of the Advisor HD Grid Mapping Catheter, Sensor Enabled, which creates detailed maps of the heart and expands Abbott's electrophysiology product portfolio. Growth in Structural Heart in 2018 was driven by several product areas including the MitraClip, Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally-invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation and the AMPLATZER® PFO occluder, a device designed to close a hole-like opening in the heart. In July 2018, Abbott announced U.S. FDA approval for a next-generation version of MitraClip. In September 2018, Abbott announced positive clinical results from its COAPT study, which demonstrated that MitraClip 31 improved survival and clinical outcomes for select patients with functional mitral regurgitation. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the COAPT study data was submitted to the U.S. FDA to request approval of an expanded indication for MitraClip. The growth in Neuromodulation in 2018 reflects higher revenue for various products for the treatment of chronic pain and movement disorders. In Vascular, growth in imaging, vessel closure and other endovascular revenues in 2018 was partially offset by lower DES sales due to lower U.S. market share and price erosion in various markets. During the second quarter of 2018, Abbott received approval from the U.S. FDA for the XIENCE Sierra Drug Eluting Stent System, the newest generation of its coronary stent system. During the second quarter of 2018, the XIENCE Sierra Drug Eluting Stent System also received national reimbursement in Japan to treat people with coronary artery disease. In Rhythm Management, market share gains in the new patient segment were offset by replacement cycle dynamics. In Heart Failure, international sales growth was offset by lower U.S. sales. In October 2018, the HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) received U.S. FDA approval as a destination therapy for people living with advanced heart failure. In 2017, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products sales grew 207.4 percent. The increase in sales was primarily driven by the acquisition of St. Jude Medical which was completed on January 4, 2017. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, sales in the vascular business were essentially flat in 2017 versus the prior year as lower coronary stent sales and the comparison impact from the favorable 2016 resolution of a third-party royalty agreement were offset by higher structural heart and endovascular sales. Abbott has periodically sold product rights to non-strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with Abbott's revenue recognition policies as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Related net sales were not significant in 2018, 2017 and 2016. The expiration of licenses and patent protection can affect the future revenues and operating income of Abbott. There are no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to materially affect Abbott. In April 2017, Abbott received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA related to its manufacturing facility in Sylmar, CA which was acquired by Abbott on January 4, 2017 as part of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. This facility manufactures implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, and monitors. The warning letter relates to the FDA's observations from an inspection of this facility. Abbott has prepared a comprehensive plan of corrective actions which has been provided to the FDA. Execution of the plan is progressing. Operating Earnings Gross profit margins were 51.3 percent of net sales in 2018, 47.5 percent in 2017 and 53.8 percent in 2016. In 2018, the increase primarily reflects lower inventory step-up amortization related to the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions and margin improvements in various businesses, partially offset by higher intangible amortization expense. In 2017, the decrease primarily reflects higher intangible amortization expense and inventory step-up amortization related to the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions, partially offset by margin improvements in various businesses. Research and development expense was $2.3 billion in 2018, $2.3 billion in 2017, and $1.4 billion in 2016 and represented a 1.7 percent increase in 2018, and a 56.2 percent increase in 2017. The 2018 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending on various projects, partially offset by lower restructuring and integration costs. The 2017 increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of the St. Jude Medical business. In 2018, research and development expenditures totaled $1.0 billion for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products 32 segment, $585 million for the Diagnostic Products segment, $198 million for the Nutritional Products segment and $184 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.1 percent in 2018 and 36.3 percent in 2017 versus the respective prior year. The 2018 increase was primarily due to the impact of the acquisition of the Alere business in October 2017, as well as higher spending to drive continued growth and market expansion in various businesses, partially offset by lower acquisition-related expenses. The 2017 increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the St. Jude Medical business, as well as the incremental expenses to integrate St. Jude Medical with Abbott's existing vascular business, partially offset by the impact of cost improvement initiatives across various functions and businesses. Business Acquisitions On January 4, 2017, Abbott completed the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, a global medical device manufacturer, for approximately $23.6 billion, including approximately $13.6 billion in cash and approximately $10 billion in Abbott common shares, which represented approximately 254 million shares of Abbott common stock, based on Abbott's closing stock price on the acquisition date. As part of the acquisition, approximately $5.9 billion of St. Jude Medical's debt was assumed, repaid or refinanced by Abbott. The acquisition provides expanded opportunities for future growth and is an important part of the company's ongoing effort to develop a strong, diverse portfolio of devices, diagnostics, nutritionals and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The combined business competes in nearly every area of the cardiovascular device market, as well as in the neuromodulation market. Under the terms of the agreement, for each St. Jude Medical common share, St. Jude Medical shareholders received $46.75 in cash and 0.8708 of an Abbott common share. At an Abbott stock price of $39.36, which reflected the closing price on January 4, 2017, this represented a value of approximately $81 per St. Jude Medical common share and total purchase consideration of $23.6 billion. The cash portion of the acquisition was funded through a combination of medium and long-term debt issued in November 2016 and a $2.0 billion 120-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility which was subsequently repaid. The final allocation of the fair value of the St. Jude Medical acquisition is shown in the table below. Acquired intangible assets, non-deductible Goodwill, non-deductible Acquired net tangible assets Deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition Net debt Total final allocation of fair value The goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is identifiable to the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products reportable segment. The acquired tangible assets consist primarily of trade accounts receivable of approximately $1.1 billion, inventory of approximately $1.7 billion, other current assets of $176 million, property and equipment of approximately $1.5 billion, and other long-term assets of approximately $455 million. The acquired tangible liabilities consist of trade accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately $1.1 billion and other non-current liabilities of approximately $870 million. In 2016, Abbott and St. Jude Medical agreed to sell certain businesses to Terumo Corporation for approximately $1.12 billion. The sale included the St. Jude Medical Angio-Seal and Femoseal vascular closure and Abbott's Vado® Steerable Sheath businesses. The sale closed on January 20, 2017 and no gain or loss was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 33 On October 3, 2017, Abbott acquired Alere, a diagnostic device and service provider, for $51.00 per common share in cash, which equated to a purchase price of approximately $4.5 billion. As part of the acquisition, Abbott tendered for Alere's preferred shares for a total value of approximately $0.7 billion. In addition, approximately $3.0 billion of Alere's debt was assumed and subsequently repaid. The acquisition establishes Abbott as a leader in point of care testing, expands Abbott's global diagnostics presence and provides access to new products, channels and geographies. Abbott utilized a combination of cash on hand and debt to fund the acquisition. See Note 11  Debt and Lines of Credit for further details regarding the debt utilized for the acquisition. The final allocation of the fair value of the Alere acquisition is shown in the table below. Acquired intangible assets, non-deductible Goodwill, non-deductible Acquired net tangible assets Deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition Net debt Preferred stock Total final allocation of fair value The goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is identifiable to the Diagnostic Products reportable segment. The approximate value of the acquired tangible assets consists of $430 million of trade accounts receivable, $425 million of inventory, $225 million of other current assets, $540 million of property and equipment, and $210 million of other long-term assets. The approximate value of the acquired tangible liabilities consists of $675 million of trade accounts payable and other current liabilities and $145 million of other non-current liabilities. In the third quarter of 2017, Alere entered into agreements to sell its Triage MeterPro cardiovascular and toxicology business and the assets and liabilities related to its B-type Natriuretic Peptide assay business run on Beckman Coulter analyzers to Quidel Corporation (Quidel). The transactions with Quidel reflect a total purchase price of $400 million payable at the close of the transaction, $240 million payable in six annual installments beginning approximately six months after the close of the transaction, and contingent consideration with a maximum value of $40 million. In the third quarter of 2017, Alere entered into an agreement with Siemens Diagnostics Holding II B.V. (Siemens) to sell its subsidiary, Epocal Inc., for approximately $200 million payable at the close of the transaction. Alere agreed to divest these businesses in connection with the review by the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission of Abbott's agreement to acquire Alere. The sale to Quidel closed on October 6, 2017, and the sale to Siemens closed on October 31, 2017. No gain or loss on these sales was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. On July 17, 2017, Abbott commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash the 1.77 million outstanding shares of Alere's Series B Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock at a price of $402 per share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends to, but not including, the settlement date of the tender offer. This tender offer was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including Abbott's acquisition of Alere and upon there being validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn) at the expiration date of the tender offer that number of shares of Preferred Stock that equaled at least a majority of the Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the expiration of the tender offer. All conditions to the offer were satisfied and Abbott accepted for payment the 1.748 million shares of Preferred Stock that were validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn). The remaining shares were cashed out for an amount equal to the $400.00 per share liquidation preference of such shares, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, without interest. Payment for all of the shares of Preferred Stock was made in the fourth quarter of 2017. 34 Restructurings In 2017 and 2018, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical into the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment and Alere into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. Abbott recorded charges, including one-time employee termination benefits, of approximately $52 million in 2018 and $187 million in 2017. Approximately $5 million in 2018 and 2017 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $10 million in 2018 is recorded in Research and development and approximately $37 million in 2018 and $182 million in 2017 in Selling, general and administrative expense. From 2016 to 2018, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $28 million in 2018, $120 million in 2017 and $32 million in 2016. Approximately $10 million in 2018, $7 million in 2017 and $9 million in 2016 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $2 million in 2018, $77 million in 2017 and $5 million in 2016 are recorded in Research and development and approximately $16 million in 2018, $36 million in 2017 and $18 million in 2016 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Additional charges of approximately $2 million in 2017 and 2016 were recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation. Interest Expense and Interest (Income) In 2018, interest expense decreased primarily due to the net repayment of $8.3 billion of debt, partially offset by lower interest income due to lower cash balances. In 2017, interest expense increased primarily due to the $15.1 billion of debt issued in November of 2016 related to the financing of the St. Jude Medical acquisition which closed on January 4, 2017. In 2016, interest expense increased primarily due to the amortization of bridge financing fees related to the financing of the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions. Interest expense in 2016 also increased due to the $15.1 billion of debt issued in November 2016. Debt Extinguishment Costs On October 28, 2018, Abbott redeemed approximately $4 billion of debt, which included $750 million principal amount of its 2.00% Notes due 2020; $597 million principal amount of its 4.125% Notes due 2020; $900 million principal amount of its 3.25% Notes due 2023; $450 million principal amount of its 3.4% Notes due 2023; and $1.300 billion principal amount of its 3.75% Notes due 2026. Abbott incurred a net charge of $153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps. On March 22, 2018, Abbott redeemed all of the $947 million principal amount of its 5.125% Notes due 2019, as well as $1.055 billion of the $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.35% Notes due 2019. Abbott incurred a net charge of $14 million related to the early repayment of this debt. Other (Income) Expense, net Other (income) expense, net, for 2018, 2017 and 2016 includes approximately $160 million of income in each year related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. These amounts are being reported in other (income) expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting standard for recognizing pension cost. 2017 includes a pre-tax gain of $1.163 billion on the sale of AMO to Johnson & Johnson. 2016 includes $947 million of expense to adjust Abbott's holding of Mylan N.V. ordinary shares due to a decline in the fair value of the securities which was considered by Abbott to be other than temporary. 35 Taxes on Earnings The income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations were 18.8 percent in 2018, 84.2 percent in 2017 and 24.8 percent in 2016. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2018, Abbott has completed its accounting for all of the enactment date income tax effects of the TCJA. If additional regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury after December 31, 2018 result in a change in judgment, the effect of such regulations will be accounted for in the period in which the regulations are finalized. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, the TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. In January 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board staff provided guidance that an entity may make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes related to items that will give rise to GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year that the tax is incurred. Abbott has elected to treat the GILTI tax as a period expense and provide for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Abbott recorded an estimate of net tax expense of $1.46 billion for the impact of the TCJA, which was included in Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The estimate was provisional and included a charge of approximately $2.89 billion for the transition tax, partially offset by a net benefit of approximately $1.42 billion for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a net benefit of approximately $10 million related to certain other impacts of the TCJA. In 2018, Abbott recorded $130 million of additional tax expense which increased the final tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.59 billion. The $130 million of additional tax expense reflects a $120 million increase in the transition tax from $2.89 billion to $3.01 billion and a $10 million reduction in the net benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The one-time transition tax is based on Abbott's total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 E&P considered held in cash and other specified assets. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining balance of Abbott's transition tax obligation is approximately $1.58 billion, which will be paid over the next eight years as allowed by the TCJA. In 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included $98 million of net tax expense related to the settlement of Abbott's 2014-2016 federal income tax audit in the U.S., partial settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group's 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in the U.S. and audit settlements in various countries. In 2017, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include $435 million of tax expense related to the gain on the sale of the AMO business. In 2016, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include the impact of a net tax benefit of approximately $225 million, primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions from prior years, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of non-deductible foreign exchange losses related to Venezuela and the adjustment of the Mylan N.V. equity investment, as well as the recognition of deferred taxes associated with the then pending sale of AMO. Exclusive of these discrete items, tax expense was favorably impacted by lower tax rates and tax exemptions on foreign income primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, and Singapore. Abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules, tax rulings, grants, and exemptions in these tax jurisdictions. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate. 36 Discontinued Operations Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax of $34 million, $124 million and $321 million, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were driven primarily by the recognition of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions pertaining to AbbVie's operations for years prior to the separation. On January 1, 2013, Abbott completed the separation of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie), which was formed to hold Abbott's research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business. Abbott has retained all liabilities for all U.S. federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation, as well as certain non-income taxes attributable to AbbVie's business. AbbVie generally will be liable for all other taxes attributable to its business. Assets Held for Disposition In September 2016, Abbott announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), its vision care business, to Johnson & Johnson for $4.325 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for cash, debt and working capital. The decision to sell AMO reflected Abbott's proactive shaping of its portfolio in line with its strategic priorities. In February 2017, Abbott completed the sale of AMO to Johnson & Johnson and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.163 billion including working capital adjustments, which was reported in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in 2017. Abbott recorded an after-tax gain of $728 million in 2017 related to the sale of AMO. The operating results of AMO up to the date of sale continued to be included in Earnings from continuing operations as the business did not qualify for reporting as discontinued operations. For 2017 and 2016, the AMO earnings (losses) before taxes included in Abbott's consolidated earnings were $(18) million and $30 million, respectively. As discussed in the Business Acquisitions section, in conjunction with the acquisition of Alere, Abbott sold the Triage MeterPro cardiovascular and toxicology business and the assets and liabilities related to its B-type Natriuretic Peptide assay business run on Beckman Coulter analyzers to Quidel. The legal transfer of certain assets related to these businesses did not occur at the close of the sale to Quidel due to, among other factors, the time required to transfer marketing authorizations and other regulatory requirements in various countries. Under the terms of the sale agreement with Abbott, Quidel is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets. The assets presented as held for disposition in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, primarily relate to the businesses sold to Quidel. The following is a summary of the assets held for disposition as of December 31, 2018 and 2017: Trade Receivables, net Total inventories Current assets held for disposition Net property and equipment Intangible assets, net of amortization Goodwill Non-current assets held for disposition Total assets held for disposition 37 Research and Development Programs Abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products in development. Research and Development Process In the Established Pharmaceuticals segment, the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment's existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. As Established Pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity. Depending upon the product, the phases of development may include: The specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to 6 or more years for complex formulations, new indications, or geographic expansion in specific countries, such as China. In the Diagnostics segment, the phases of the research and development process include: The regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions. In the U.S., the FDA classifies diagnostic products into classes (I, II, or III) and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval. While the Diagnostics segment has products in all three classes, the vast majority of its products are categorized as Class I or Class II. Submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for Class I products. Class II devices typically require pre-market notification to the FDA through a regulatory filing known as a 510(k) submission. Most Class III products are subject to the FDA's Pre-Marketing Approval (PMA) requirements. Other Class III products, such as those used to screen blood, require the submission and approval of a Biological License Application (BLA). In the European Union (EU), diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process, which is governed by the European In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive, depends upon the category. Certain product categories require review and approval by an independent 38 company, known as a Notified Body, before the manufacturer can affix a CE mark to the product to show compliance with the Directive. Other products only require a self-certification process. In the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation segment, the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability. If the research program passes that hurdle, it moves forward into development. The development process includes evaluation, selection and qualification of a product design, completion of applicable clinical trials to test the product's safety and efficacy, and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre-determined specifications. Similar to the diagnostic products discussed above, in the U.S., cardiovascular and neuromodulation products are classified as Class I, II, or III. Most of Abbott's cardiovascular and neuromodulation products are classified as Class II devices that follow the 510(k) regulatory process or Class III devices that are subject to the PMA process. In the EU, cardiovascular and neuromodulation products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process, which is governed by the European Medical Device Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, varies by class. Each product must bear a CE mark to show compliance with the Directive. Some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to CE marking of the device. For other products, the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self-certify its ability to apply the CE mark to the product. Outside the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions. After approval and commercial launch of some cardiovascular and neuromodulation products, post-market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority. In the second quarter of 2017, the EU adopted the new Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) which replace the existing directives in the EU for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic products. The MDR and IVDR will apply after a three-year and five-year transition period, respectively, and will impose additional premarket and postmarket regulatory requirements on manufacturers of such products. In the Nutritional segment, the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations (e.g., infants and adults) or patients (e.g., people with diabetes). Depending upon the country and/or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. In the U.S., the FDA requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products. Prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change, the company is required to obtain the FDA's confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging. For other nutritional products, notification or pre-approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive. In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products. Areas of Focus In 2019 and beyond, Abbott's significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following: Established Pharmaceuticals  Abbott focuses on building country-specific portfolios made up of high-quality medicines that meet the needs of people in emerging markets. Over the next several years, Abbott plans to expand its product portfolio in key therapeutic areas with the aim of being among the first to launch new off-patent and differentiated medicines. In addition, Abbott continues to expand existing 39 brands into new markets, implement product enhancements that provide value to patients and acquire strategic products and technology through licensing activities. Abbott is also actively working on the further development of several key brands such as Creon, Duphaston, Duphalac and Influvac. Depending on the product, the activities focus on development of new data, markets, formulations, delivery systems, or indications. Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation  Abbott's research and development programs focus on: Diabetes Care  Develop enhancements and additional indications for the FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring system to help patients improve their ability to manage diabetes. Core Laboratory Diagnostics  Abbott continues to commercialize its next-generation blood screening, immunoassay, clinical chemistry and hematology systems, along with assays, including a focus on unmet medical need, in various areas including infectious disease, cardiac care, metabolics, oncology, as well as informatics and automation solutions to increase efficiency in laboratories. Molecular Diagnostics  Several new molecular in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests and ""Alinity m"", a next generation instrument system, are in various stages of development and launch. Rapid Diagnostics  Abbott's research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for cardiometabolic disease, infectious disease and toxicology. Nutritionals  Abbott is focusing its research and development spend on platforms that span the pediatric and adult nutrition areas: gastro intestinal/immunity health, brain health, mobility and metabolism, and user experience platforms. Numerous new products that build on advances in these platforms are currently under development, including clinical outcome testing, and are expected to be launched over the coming years. Given the diversity of Abbott's business, its intention to remain a broad-based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth, no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years. Factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to Abbott's total research and development expenses, as well as qualitative factors, such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on Abbott's overall market position. There were no delays in Abbott's 2018 research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations. 40 While the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material, the total cost to complete will depend upon Abbott's ability to successfully finish each project, the rate at which each project advances, and the ultimate timing for completion. Given the potential for significant delays and the risk of failure inherent in the development of medical device, diagnostic and pharmaceutical products and technologies, it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development. Abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spending that will be competitive in each of the businesses in which it participates, and such spending is expected to approximate 7.5 percent of total Abbott sales in 2019. Abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period. Goodwill At December 31, 2018, goodwill recorded as a result of business combinations totaled $23.3 billion. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the third quarter or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs, using a quantitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The income and market approaches are used to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. The results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Financial Condition Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities amounted to $6.3 billion, $5.6 billion and $3.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in Net cash from operating activities in 2018 was primarily due to higher segment operating earnings, continued improvements in working capital management, timing of pension contributions and lower acquisition-related expenses. The increase in Net cash from operating activities in 2017 was primarily due to the favorable impact of improved working capital management, the acquisition of the St. Jude Medical businesses, and higher segment operating earnings. The income tax component of cash from operating activities in 2018 includes the non-cash impact of the $120 million adjustment to the transition tax associated with the TCJA. The income tax component of operating cash flow in 2017 includes the non-cash impact of $1.46 billion of net tax expense related to the estimated impact of the TCJA. The income tax component of operating cash flow in 2016 includes $550 million of non-cash tax benefits primarily related to the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years. The foreign currency loss related to Venezuela reduced Abbott's cash by approximately $410 million in 2016 and is included in the Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents line within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Future fluctuations in the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies are not expected to materially impact Abbott's liquidity. While a significant portion of Abbott's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2018, are reinvested in foreign subsidiaries, Abbott does not expect such reinvestment to affect its liquidity and capital resources. Due to the enactment of the TCJA, if these funds were needed for operations in the U.S., Abbott does not expect to incur significant additional income taxes in the future to repatriate these funds. Abbott funded $114 million in 2018, $645 million in 2017 and $582 million in 2016 to defined benefit pension plans. Abbott expects pension funding of approximately $380 million in 2019 for its pension plans. Abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed Abbott's capital expenditures and cash dividends. 41 Debt and Capital At December 31, 2018, Abbott's long-term debt rating was BBB by Standard & Poor's Corporation and Baa1 by Moody's. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including unused lines of credit that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements and provide Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. The lines of credit are part of a 2018 revolving credit agreement that expires in 2023. Abbott entered into this new revolving credit agreement and terminated the 2014 revolving credit agreement on November 30, 2018. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2014 revolving credit agreement at the time of its termination. Any borrowings under the new revolving credit agreement will bear interest, at Abbott's option, based on either a base rate or Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott's credit ratings. In conjunction with the funding of the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions and the assumption of St. Jude Medical's and Alere's existing debt, Abbott's total short-term and long-term debt increased from approximately $9.0 billion at December 31, 2015 to $27.9 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase in debt included the following transactions in 2016 and 2017: 42 quarter of 2017, in conjunction with the acquisition of Alere, Abbott assumed and subsequently repaid $3.0 billion of Alere's debt. In 2018 Abbott committed to reducing its debt levels and on February 16, 2018, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. Redemptions under this authorization during 2018 included $0.947 billion principal amount of its 5.125% Notes due 2019 and $2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.35% Notes due 2019. Abbott incurred a net charge of $14 million related to the early repayment of this debt. On September 17, 2018, Abbott repaid upon maturity the $500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2.00% Senior Notes due 2018. On September 27, 2018, Abbott's wholly owned subsidiary, Abbott Ireland Financing DAC, completed a euro debt offering of €3.420 billion of long-term debt. The proceeds equated to approximately $4 billion. The notes are guaranteed by Abbott. On October 28, 2018, Abbott redeemed $4.0 billion principal amount of its outstanding long-term debt. This amount is in addition to the $5 billion authorization discussed above. In conjunction with the redemption, Abbott unwound approximately $1.1 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 3.40% Note due in 2023 and the 3.75% Note due in 2026. Abbott incurred a net charge of $153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps. The 2018 transactions described above, including the repayment of $2.8 billion under the 5-year term loan and $1.15 billion of borrowings under the lines of credit, resulted in the net repayment of approximately $8.3 billion of debt. On January 25, 2019, Abbott notified the holders of its 2.80% Notes due 2020, that it will redeem the $500 million outstanding principal amount of these notes on February 24, 2019. After the redemption of the 2.80% Notes, approximately $700 million of the $5 billion debt redemption authorized by Abbott's board of directors in 2018 will remain available. In September 2014, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of Abbott's common shares from time to time. Under the program authorized in 2014, Abbott repurchased 36.2 million shares at a cost of $1.7 billion in 2015, 10.4 million shares at a cost of $408 million in 2016 and 1.9 million shares at a cost of $130 million in 2018 for a total of approximately $2.2 billion. On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. No shares have been issued under this authorization. Abbott declared dividends of $1.16 per share in 2018 compared to $1.075 per share in 2017, an increase of approximately 8 percent. Dividends paid were $1.974 billion in 2018 compared to $1.849 billion in 2017. The year-over-year change in dividends paid reflects the impact of the increase in the dividend rate. Working Capital Working capital was $5.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and $11.2 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease in working capital in 2018 reflects the use of cash to repay long-term debt and dividends. 43 Abbott monitors the credit worthiness of customers and establishes an allowance against a trade receivable when it is probable that the balance will not be collected. In addition to closely monitoring economic conditions and budgetary and other fiscal developments, Abbott regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. Abbott also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables. Venezuela Operations Since January 2010, Venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. On February 17, 2016, the Venezuelan government announced that its three-tier exchange rate system would be reduced to two rates renamed the DIPRO and DICOM rates. The DIPRO was the official rate for food and medicine imports and was adjusted from 6.3 to 10 bolivars per U.S. dollar. The DICOM rate was a floating market rate published daily by the Venezuelan central bank, which at the end of the first quarter of 2016 was approximately 263 bolivars per U.S. dollar. As a result of decreasing government approvals to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars to pay for intercompany accounts, as well as the accelerating deterioration of economic conditions in the country, Abbott concluded that it was appropriate to move to the DICOM rate at the end of the first quarter of 2016. As a result, Abbott recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of $480 million in 2016 to revalue its net monetary assets in Venezuela. After the revaluation, Abbott's investment in its Venezuelan operations was not significant. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures of $1.4 billion in 2018, $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.1 billion in 2016 were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment in various segments, investments in information technology, and laboratory instruments placed with customers. Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes Abbott's estimated contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. Long-term debt, including current maturities Interest on debt obligations Operating lease obligations Capitalized auto lease obligations Purchase commitments (a) Other long-term liabilities (b) Total (c) 44 details. The company has employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other post-employment benefits, including medical and life, which have been excluded from the table. A discussion of the company's pension and post-retirement plans, including funding matters is included in Note 14  Post-employment Benefits. Contingent Obligations Abbott has periodically entered into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, which has resulted in Abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that Abbott was previously primarily liable. Since Abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, Abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these obligations. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. In addition, Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. Legislative Issues Abbott's primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the TCJA, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings (Earnings employed in the business). The standard would have become effective for Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. Abbott elected to adopt the new standard at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result of the adoption of the new standard, approximately $337 million of stranded tax effects were reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Earnings employed in the business. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which makes changes to the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. The standard would have become effective for Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. Abbott elected to early adopt ASU 2017-12 in the fourth quarter of 2018. The impact of adopting the standard is not significant to Abbott's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation  Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost which changes the financial statement presentation requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit expense. While service cost continues to be reported in the same financial statement line items as other current employee compensation costs, the ASU requires all other components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense to be presented separately from service cost, and outside any subtotal of income from operations. The standard was adopted by Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2018. The change in the presentation of the components of pension cost per year was applied retrospectively. As a result, approximately $160 million of net pension-related income per year was moved from the operating lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings to non-operating income for 2017 and 2016. 45 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash , which requires that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. Abbott adopted this standard beginning in the first quarter of 2018, and applied the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented. Abbott did not have any restricted cash balances in the periods presented except for $75 million of restricted cash acquired as part of the Alere acquisition in October 2017. The restrictions on this cash were eliminated prior to the end of 2017. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which requires the recognition of the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the period in which the transfer occurs. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that was not significant. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which clarifies how companies should present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The ASU became effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2018 and did not have a material impact to the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases on the balance sheet. The standard becomes effective for Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019. Abbott completed a detailed review of its leases. Abbott will use the modified retrospective approach with the package of practical expedients which allows Abbott to carry forward the historical lease classification for existing or expired leases and to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its lessee arrangements. Abbott does not expect the new lease accounting standard to have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. As a result of adopting ASU 2016-02, Abbott expects to record approximately $800 million to $900 million of right of use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which provides new guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2018. Under the new standard, changes in the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values are recorded in Other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Previously, such fair value changes were recorded in other comprehensive income. Abbott has elected the measurement alternative allowed by ASU 2016-01 for its equity investments without readily determinable fair values. These investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus any changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Changes in the measurement of these investments are being recorded in Other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. As part of the adoption, the cumulative-effect adjustment to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for net unrealized losses on equity investments that were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2017 was not significant. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which provides a single comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and supersedes nearly all previously existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach 46 method. Under this method, entities recognize the cumulative effect of applying the new standard at the date of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods presented. The cumulative effect of applying the new standard resulted in an increase to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $23 million which was recorded on January 1, 2018. The new standard has been applied only to those contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. The impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 was not significant to individual financial statement line items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments and Risk Management Market Price Sensitive Investments The fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $13 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2018 by approximately $3 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $307 million and $363 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments are recorded in earnings. Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities Abbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $211 million and $228 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $61 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $2.9 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $19.9 billion and $29.0 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.5% and 3.6% as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively) with maturities through 2046. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.1 billion. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values. (A 100-basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in rates.) 47 Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Abbott held $5.1 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2018 will mature in 2019 or 2020 depending upon the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2017 matured in 2018 or will mature in 2019 depending upon the contract. Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Abbott held $13.6 billion and $20.1 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next 24 months. In March 2017, Abbott repaid its $479 million foreign denominated short-term debt which was designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary. At December 31, 2016, the value of this short-term debt was $454 million, and changes in the fair value of the debt up through the date of repayment due to changes in exchange rates were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017: Primarily U.S. Dollars to be exchanged for the following currencies: Euro Chinese Yuan Japanese Yen All other currencies Total 48 ITEM 8.

statement. 55 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies NATURE OF BUSINESS  Abbott's principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. USE OF ESTIMATES  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for sales rebates; income taxes; pension and other post-employment benefits, including certain asset values that are based on significant unobservable inputs; valuation of intangible assets; litigation; derivative financial instruments; and inventory and accounts receivable exposures. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. REVENUE RECOGNITION  Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Revenue from the launch of a new product, from an improved version of an existing product, or for shipments in excess of a customer's normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve for such revenue, if necessary. In certain of Abbott's businesses, primarily within diagnostics, Abbott participates in selling arrangements that include multiple performance obligations (e.g., instruments, reagents, procedures, and service agreements). The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Sales of product rights for marketable products are recorded as revenue upon disposition of the rights. INCOME TAXES  Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when the taxes are paid. No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings. EARNINGS PER SHARE  Unvested restricted stock units and awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between 56 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $2.320 billion, $346 million and $1.057 billion, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $2.353 billion, $468 million and $1.393 billion, respectively. PENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS  Abbott accrues for the actuarially determined cost of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a five-year period. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  For assets and liabilities that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, total fair value is the published market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs are valued by reference to similar assets or liabilities, adjusted for contract restrictions and other terms specific to that asset or liability. For these items, a significant portion of fair value is derived by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets. For all remaining assets and liabilities, fair value is derived using a fair value model, such as a discounted cash flow model or Black-Scholes model. Purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value. The fair value of significant purchased intangible assets is based on independent appraisals. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards and units are amortized over their requisite service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible, with a charge to compensation expense. In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . ASU 2016-09 modifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes and classification on the statement of cash flows. Abbott adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2017 and the following changes were made to the presentation of Abbott's financial statements: 57 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) LITIGATION  Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with FASB ASC No. 450, ""Contingencies."" Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. Legal fees are recorded as incurred. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS  Cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits, U.S. government securities money market funds and U.S. treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less. Abbott holds certain investments with a carrying value of approximately $325 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments held in a rabbi trust and investments in publicly traded equity securities are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. Investments in equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity, as management has both the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity, and are reported at cost, net of any unamortized premium or discount. Income relating to these securities is reported as interest income. TRADE RECEIVABLE VALUATIONS  Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance against gross trade receivables reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information. Accounts receivable are charged off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted. INVENTORIES  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost includes material and conversion costs. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table shows estimated useful lives of property and equipment: Buildings Equipment PRODUCT LIABILITY  Abbott accrues for product liability claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The liabilities are adjusted quarterly as additional information becomes available. Receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims are recorded as assets, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. Product liability losses are self-insured. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  Internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS AND COLLABORATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D)  The initial costs of rights to IPR&D projects obtained in an asset acquisition are expensed as 58 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) IPR&D unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. The fair value of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completed and are then amortized over the remaining useful life. Collaborations are not significant. CONCENTRATION OF RISK AND GUARANTEES  Due to the nature of its operations, Abbott is not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers, products or geographic locations. Product warranties are not significant. Abbott has no material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements; no special purpose entities; nor activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business, such as assignment of product rights, with other companies, which has resulted in Abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that Abbott was previously primarily liable. Since Abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties, Abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these obligations. Based upon past experience, the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote. Abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which Abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events. Note 2  New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings (Earnings employed in the business). Abbott adopted the new standard at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result of the adoption of the new standard, approximately $337 million of stranded tax effects were reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Earnings employed in the business. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which makes changes to the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. The standard would have become effective for Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. Abbott elected to early adopt ASU 2017-12 in the fourth quarter of 2018. The impact of adopting the standard is not significant to Abbott's Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation  Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost which changes the financial statement presentation requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit expense. While service cost continues to be reported in the same financial statement line items as other current employee compensation costs, the ASU requires all other components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense to be presented separately from service cost, and outside any subtotal of income from operations. The standard was adopted by Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2018. The change in the presentation of the components of pension cost per year was applied retrospectively. As a 59 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2  New Accounting Standards (Continued) result, approximately $160 million of net pension-related income per year was moved from the operating lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings to non-operating income for 2017 and 2016. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash , which requires that restricted cash be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. Abbott adopted this standard beginning in the first quarter of 2018, and applied the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented. Abbott did not have any restricted cash balances in the periods presented except for $75 million of restricted cash acquired as part of the Alere Inc. (Alere) acquisition in October 2017. The restrictions on this cash were eliminated prior to the end of 2017. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , which requires the recognition of the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the period in which the transfer occurs. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that was not significant. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which clarifies how companies should present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The ASU became effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2018 and did not have a material impact to the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which provides new guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2018. Under the new standard, changes in the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values are recorded in Other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Previously, such fair value changes were recorded in other comprehensive income. Abbott has elected the measurement alternative allowed by ASU 2016-01 for its equity investments without readily determinable fair values. These investments are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus any changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Changes in the measurement of these investments are being recorded in Other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. As part of the adoption, the cumulative-effect adjustment to Earnings employed in the business in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for net unrealized losses on equity investments that were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2017 was not significant. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which provides a single comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and supersedes nearly all previously existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach method. Under this method, entities recognize the cumulative effect of applying the new standard at the date of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods presented. The cumulative effect of applying the new standard resulted in an increase to Earnings employed in the business in the 60 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 2  New Accounting Standards (Continued) Consolidated Balance Sheet of $23 million which was recorded on January 1, 2018. The new standard has been applied only to those contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. The impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 was not significant to individual financial statement line items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases on the balance sheet. The standard becomes effective for Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019. Abbott completed a detailed review of its leases. Abbott will use the modified retrospective approach with the package of practical expedients which allows Abbott to carry forward the historical lease classification for leases existing at, or entered into after the beginning of the period of adoption and to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its lessee arrangements. Abbott does not expect the new lease accounting standard to have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. As a result of adopting ASU 2016-02, Abbott expects to record approximately $800 million to $900 million of right of use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 3  Revenue Abbott's revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott's products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott's products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians' offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products. Diabetes Care is a non-reportable segment and is included in Other in the following table. 61 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3  Revenue (Continued) The following tables provide detail by sales category: Established Pharmaceutical Products  Key Emerging Markets Other Total Nutritionals  Pediatric Nutritionals Adult Nutritionals Total Diagnostics  Core Laboratory Molecular Point of Care Rapid Diagnostics Total Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation  Rhythm Management Electrophysiology Heart Failure Vascular Structural Heart Neuromodulation Total Other Total Abbott recognizes revenue from product sales upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. For maintenance agreements that provide service beyond Abbott's standard warranty and other service agreements, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. A time-based measure of progress appropriately reflects the transfer of services to the customer. Payment terms between Abbott and its customers vary by the type of customer, country of sale, and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and the payment due date is not significant. Management exercises judgment in estimating variable consideration. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Abbott 62 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3  Revenue (Continued) provides rebates to government agencies, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other private entities. Rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product. Factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate, which customer or government agency price terms apply, and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate. Using historical trends, adjusted for current changes, Abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid, and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when Abbott records its sale of the product. Settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six months after sale. Abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs. Historically, adjustments to prior years' rebate accruals have not been material to net income. Other allowances charged against gross sales include cash discounts and returns, which are not significant. Cash discounts are known within 15 to 30 days of sale, and therefore can be reliably estimated. Returns can be reliably estimated because Abbott's historical returns are low, and because sales return terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods. Product warranties are also not significant. Abbott also applies judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition related to contracts that include multiple performance obligations. The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. For goods or services for which observable standalone selling prices are not available, Abbott uses an expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2018, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $2.9 billion in the Diagnostic Products segment and approximately $410 million in the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, approximately 16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. Assets Recognized for Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer Abbott has applied the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and records as an expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers in the period of occurrence when the amortization period of the asset that Abbott otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Upfront commission fees paid to sales personnel as a result of obtaining or renewing contracts with customers are incremental 63 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 3  Revenue (Continued) to obtaining the contract. Abbott capitalizes these amounts as contract costs. Capitalized commission fees are amortized based on the contract duration to which the assets relate which ranges from two to ten years. The amounts as of December 31, 2018, were not significant. Additionally, the cost of transmitters provided to customers that use Abbott's remote monitoring service with respect to certain medical devices are capitalized as contract costs. Capitalized transmitter costs are amortized based on the timing of the transfer of services to which the assets relate, which typically ranges from eight to ten years. The amounts as of December 31, 2018, were not significant. Other Contract Assets and Liabilities Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their net realizable value. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott's conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott's contract liabilities arise primarily in the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: Contract Liabilities Balance at January 1, 2018 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period Revenue recognized that was included in contract liability balance at beginning of period Balance at December 31, 2018 Note 4  Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Disposition On February 27, 2015, Abbott completed the sale of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to Mylan Inc. (Mylan) for 110 million ordinary shares (or approximately 22 percent) of a newly formed entity (Mylan N.V.) that combined Mylan's existing business and Abbott's developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business. In April 2015, Abbott sold 40.25 million of the 110 million ordinary shares of Mylan N.V. received in the sale of the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to Mylan. In 2015, Abbott recorded a pretax gain of $207 million on $2.29 billion in net proceeds from the sale of these shares. In 2017, Abbott sold 69.75 million ordinary shares of Mylan N.V. and received $2.704 billion in proceeds. Abbott recorded a $45 million gain from the sale of these ordinary shares in 2017, which was recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Abbott no longer has an ownership interest in Mylan N.V. On February 10, 2015, Abbott completed the sale of its animal health business to Zoetis Inc. Abbott received cash proceeds of $230 million and reported an after tax gain on the sale of approximately $130 million. In the first quarter of 2016, Abbott received an additional $25 million of proceeds due to the expiration of a holdback agreement associated with the sale of this business and reported an after-tax gain of $16 million. 64 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 4  Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Disposition (Continued) As a result of the disposition of the above businesses, the operating results of these businesses up to the date of sale are reported as part of discontinued operations on the Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net of taxes line in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. On January 1, 2013, Abbott completed the separation of AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie), which was formed to hold Abbott's research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business. Abbott has retained all liabilities for all U.S. federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation, as well as certain non-income taxes attributable to AbbVie's business. AbbVie generally will be liable for all other taxes attributable to its business. The net earnings of discontinued operations include income tax benefits of $39 million in 2018, $109 million in 2017 and $325 million in 2016. These tax benefits primarily relate to the resolution of various tax positions related to AbbVie's operations for years prior to the separation. In September 2016, Abbott announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell Abbott Medical Optics (AMO), its vision care business, to Johnson & Johnson for $4.325 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for cash, debt and working capital. The decision to sell AMO reflected Abbott's proactive shaping of its portfolio in line with its strategic priorities. In February 2017, Abbott completed the sale of AMO to Johnson & Johnson and recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.163 billion including working capital adjustments, which was reported in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in 2017. Abbott recorded an after-tax gain of $728 million in 2017 related to the sale of AMO. The operating results of AMO up to the date of sale continued to be included in Earnings from continuing operations as the business did not qualify for reporting as discontinued operations. For 2017 and 2016, the AMO earnings (losses) before taxes included in Abbott's consolidated earnings were $(18) million and $30 million, respectively. As discussed in Note 7  Business Acquisitions, in conjunction with the acquisition of Alere, Abbott sold the Triage MeterPro cardiovascular and toxicology business and the assets and liabilities related to its B-type Natriuretic Peptide assay business run on Beckman Coulter analyzers to Quidel Corporation (Quidel). The legal transfer of certain assets related to these businesses did not occur at the close of the sale to Quidel due to, among other factors, the time required to transfer marketing authorizations and other regulatory requirements in various countries. Under the terms of the sale agreement with Abbott, Quidel is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets. The assets presented as held for disposition in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, primarily relate to the businesses sold to Quidel. 65 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 4  Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Disposition (Continued) The following is a summary of the assets held for disposition as of December 31, 2018 and 2017: Trade receivables, net Total inventories Current assets held for disposition Net property and equipment Intangible assets, net of amortization Goodwill Non-current assets held for disposition Total assets held for disposition Note 5  Supplemental Financial Information Other (income) expense, net, for 2018, 2017 and 2016 includes approximately $160 million of income related to the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension and post-retirement medical plans. These amounts are being reported in other (income) expense as a result of the adoption of the new accounting standard for recognizing pension cost. Other (income) expense, net, for 2017 includes a pre-tax gain of $1.163 billion related to the sale of AMO to Johnson & Johnson. See Note 4  Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Disposition for further discussion of this sale. In 2017, Abbott sold 69.75 million ordinary shares of Mylan N.V. and received $2.704 billion in proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of these ordinary shares. Other (income) expense, net, for 2016 includes expense of $947 million to adjust Abbott's holding of Mylan N.V. ordinary shares due to a decline in the fair value of the securities which was considered by Abbott to be other than temporary. The detail of various balance sheet components is as follows: Long-term Investments: Equity securities Other Total Abbott's equity securities as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, include $307 million and $363 million, respectively, of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. Abbott also holds certain investments as of December 31, 2018 with a carrying value of approximately $325 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of $211 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The $211 million 66 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 5  Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) carrying value includes an unrealized gain of approximately $50 million on an investment. The gain was recorded in the second quarter of 2018 and relates to an observable price change for a similar investment of the same issuer. Other Accrued Liabilities: Accrued rebates payable to government agencies Accrued other rebates (a) All other Total Post-employment Obligations and Other Long-term Liabilities: Defined benefit pension plans and post-employment medical and dental plans for significant plans Deferred income taxes All other (b) Total Since January 2010, Venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. On February 17, 2016, the Venezuelan government announced that its three-tier exchange rate system would be reduced to two rates renamed the DIPRO and DICOM rates. The DIPRO was the official rate for food and medicine imports and was adjusted from 6.3 to 10 bolivars per U.S. dollar. The DICOM rate was a floating market rate published daily by the Venezuelan central bank, which at the end of the first quarter of 2016 was approximately 263 bolivars per U.S. dollar. As a result of decreasing government approvals to convert bolivars to U.S. dollars to pay for intercompany accounts, as well as the accelerating deterioration of economic conditions in the country, Abbott concluded that it was appropriate to move to the DICOM rate at the end of the first quarter of 2016. As a result, Abbott recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of $480 million in 2016 to revalue its net monetary assets in Venezuela. After the revaluation, Abbott's investment in its Venezuelan operations was not significant. 67 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 6  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The components of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income taxes, are as follows: ( in millions ) Balance at December 31, 2016 Impact of business dispositions Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (a) Net current period other comprehensive income (loss) Balance at December 31, 2017 Impact of adoption of new accounting standards Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (a) Net current period other comprehensive income (loss) Balance at December 31, 2018 Note 7  Business Acquisitions On January 4, 2017, Abbott completed the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, a global medical device manufacturer, for approximately $23.6 billion, including approximately $13.6 billion in cash and approximately $10 billion in Abbott common shares, which represented approximately 254 million shares of Abbott common stock, based on Abbott's closing stock price on the acquisition date. As part of the acquisition, approximately $5.9 billion of St. Jude Medical's debt was assumed, repaid or refinanced by Abbott. The acquisition provides expanded opportunities for future growth and is an important part of the company's ongoing effort to develop a strong, diverse portfolio of devices, diagnostics, nutritionals and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The combined business competes in nearly every area of the cardiovascular device market, as well as in the neuromodulation market. 68 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7  Business Acquisitions (Continued) Under the terms of the agreement, for each St. Jude Medical common share, St. Jude Medical shareholders received $46.75 in cash and 0.8708 of an Abbott common share. At an Abbott stock price of $39.36, which reflects the closing price on January 4, 2017, this represented a value of approximately $81 per St. Jude Medical common share and total purchase consideration of $23.6 billion. The cash portion of the acquisition was funded through a combination of medium and long-term debt issued in November 2016 and a $2.0 billion 120-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility which was subsequently repaid. The final allocation of the fair value of the St. Jude Medical acquisition is shown in the table below. Acquired intangible assets, non-deductible Goodwill, non-deductible Acquired net tangible assets Deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition Net debt Total final allocation of fair value The goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is identifiable to the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products reportable segment. The acquired tangible assets consist primarily of trade accounts receivable of approximately $1.1 billion, inventory of approximately $1.7 billion, other current assets of $176 million, property and equipment of approximately $1.5 billion, and other long-term assets of approximately $455 million. The acquired tangible liabilities consist of trade accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately $1.1 billion and other non-current liabilities of approximately $870 million. In 2016, Abbott and St. Jude Medical agreed to sell certain businesses to Terumo Corporation (Terumo) for approximately $1.12 billion. The sale included the St. Jude Medical Angio-Seal and Femoseal vascular closure and Abbott's Vado® Steerable Sheath businesses. The sale closed on January 20, 2017 and no gain or loss was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. On October 3, 2017, Abbott acquired Alere, a diagnostic device and service provider, for $51.00 per common share in cash, which equated to a purchase price of approximately $4.5 billion. As part of the acquisition, Abbott tendered for Alere's preferred shares for a total value of approximately $0.7 billion. In addition, approximately $3.0 billion of Alere's debt was assumed and subsequently repaid. The acquisition establishes Abbott as a leader in point of care testing, expands Abbott's global diagnostics presence and provides access to new products, channels and geographies. Abbott utilized a combination of cash on hand and debt to fund the acquisition. See Note 11  Debt and Lines of Credit for further details regarding the debt utilized for the acquisition. 69 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7  Business Acquisitions (Continued) The final allocation of the fair value of the Alere acquisition is shown in the table below. Acquired intangible assets, non-deductible Goodwill, non-deductible Acquired net tangible assets Deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition Net debt Preferred stock Total final allocation of fair value The goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is identifiable to the Diagnostic Products reportable segment. The approximate value of the acquired tangible assets is $430 million of trade accounts receivable, $425 million of inventory, $225 million of other current assets, $540 million of property and equipment, and $210 million of other long-term assets. The approximate value of the acquired tangible liabilities is $675 million of trade accounts payable and other current liabilities and $145 million of other non-current liabilities. In the third quarter of 2017, Alere entered into agreements to sell its Triage MeterPro cardiovascular and toxicology business and the assets and liabilities related to its B-type Natriuretic Peptide assay business run on Beckman Coulter analyzers to Quidel. The transactions with Quidel reflect a total purchase price of $400 million payable at the close of the transaction, $240 million payable in six annual installments beginning approximately six months after the close of the transaction, and contingent consideration with a maximum value of $40 million. In the third quarter of 2017, Alere entered into an agreement with Siemens Diagnostics Holding II B.V. (Siemens) to sell its subsidiary, Epocal Inc., for approximately $200 million payable at the close of the transaction. Alere agreed to divest these businesses in connection with the review by the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission of Abbott's agreement to acquire Alere. The sale to Quidel closed on October 6, 2017, and the sale to Siemens closed on October 31, 2017. No gain or loss on these sales was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In 2017, consolidated Abbott results include $6.5 billion of sales and a pre-tax loss of approximately $1.3 billion related to the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions, including approximately $1.5 billion of intangible amortization and $907 million of inventory step-up amortization. The pre-tax loss excludes acquisition, integration and restructuring-related costs. If the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere had occurred at the beginning of 2016, unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales would have been approximately $28.9 billion and the unaudited pro forma consolidated net loss from continuing operations would have been approximately $485 million in 2016. This includes amortization of approximately $940 million of inventory step-up and $1.7 billion of intangibles related to St. Jude Medical and Alere. For 2017, unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales would have been approximately $28.9 billion and unaudited pro forma consolidated net earnings from continuing operations would have been approximately $750 million, which includes $225 million of intangible amortization related to Alere. The unaudited pro forma consolidated net earnings from continuing operations for 2017 exclude inventory step-up amortization related to St. Jude Medical and Alere of approximately $907 million which was recorded in 2017 but included in the 2016 unaudited pro 70 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 7  Business Acquisitions (Continued) forma results as noted above. The unaudited pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that would have been realized had the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions been completed as of the beginning of 2016, nor is it meant to be indicative of future results of operations that the combined entity will experience. On July 17, 2017, Abbott commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash the 1.77 million outstanding shares of Alere's Series B Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock at a price of $402 per share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends to, but not including, the settlement date of the tender offer. This tender offer was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including Abbott's acquisition of Alere and upon there being validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn) at the expiration date of the tender offer that number of shares of Preferred Stock that equaled at least a majority of the Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the expiration of the tender offer. The tender offer expired on October 3, 2017. All conditions to the offer were satisfied and Abbott accepted for payment the 1.748 million shares of Preferred Stock that were validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn). The remaining shares were cashed out for an amount equal to the $400.00 per share liquidation preference of such shares, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, without interest. Payment for all of the shares of Preferred Stock was made in the fourth quarter of 2017. Note 8  Goodwill and Intangible Assets The total amount of goodwill reported was $23.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and $24.0 billion at December 31, 2017. The amounts reported at December 31, 2018 and 2017 exclude goodwill reported in non-current assets held for disposition. In 2018, foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $440 million. Purchase price accounting adjustments associated with the Alere acquisition decreased goodwill by $326 million in 2018. Goodwill increased by $17.2 billion in 2017 due to the completion of the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 billion due to the sale of certain businesses to Terumo, Quidel and Siemens. Foreign currency translation increased goodwill by $653 million in 2017. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at December 31, 2018 was $3.0 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $3.7 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $15.3 billion for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment. In 2018 and 2017, there were no significant reductions of goodwill relating to impairments. The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $25.7 billion and $25.6 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $10.4 billion and $8.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2018, purchase price allocation adjustments increased intangible assets by $280 million and foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $281 million. In 2017, the gross amount of amortizable intangible assets increased by approximately $14.5 billion due to the completion of the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of $210 million due to the sale of certain businesses to Quidel and Siemens. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, were approximately $3.6 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2018 primarily relates to purchase price allocation adjustments associated with the Alere acquisition. In 2017, in-process research and development increased by $4.5 billion due to the completion of the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions, a portion of which became amortizable during the year. In 2017, Abbott also recorded a $53 million impairment of an 71 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 8  Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Continued) in-process research and development project related to the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment. The estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2018 is approximately $2.0 billion in 2019, $2.2 billion in 2020, $2.1 billion in 2021, $2.0 billion in 2022 and $2.0 billion in 2023. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over 2 to 20 years (weighted average 12 years). Note 9  Restructuring Plans In 2017 and 2018, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment, and Alere into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $52 million in 2018 and $187 million in 2017. Approximately $5 million in 2018 and 2017 is recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $10 million in 2018 is recorded in Research and development, and approximately $37 million in 2018 and $182 million in 2017 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Abbott also assumed restructuring liabilities of approximately $23 million as part of the St Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions. The following summarizes the activity related to these actions and the status of the related accruals: Liabilities assumed as part of business acquisitions Restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments Accrued balance at December 31, 2017 Restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments Accrued balance at December 31, 2018 From 2016 to 2018, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $28 million in 2018, $120 million in 2017 and $32 million in 2016. Approximately $10 million in 2018, $7 million in 2017, and $9 million in 2016 are recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $2 million in 2018, $77 million in 2017 and $5 million in 2016 are recorded in Research and development and approximately $16 million in 2018, $36 million in 2017 and $18 million in 2016 are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. Additional charges of approximately $2 million in 2017 and 2016 were recorded primarily for accelerated depreciation. 72 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 9  Restructuring Plans (Continued) The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings: Restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments Accrued balance at December 31, 2016 Restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments Accrued balance at December 31, 2017 Restructuring charges Payments and other adjustments Accrued balance at December 31, 2018 Note 10  Incentive Stock Program The 2017 Incentive Stock Program authorizes the granting of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards, foreign benefits and other share-based awards. Stock options and restricted stock awards and units comprise the majority of benefits that have been granted and are currently outstanding under this program and a prior program. In 2018, Abbott granted 5,760,221 stock options, 871,331 restricted stock awards and 8,093,546 restricted stock units under this program. Under Abbott's stock incentive programs, the purchase price of shares under option must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the maximum term of an option is 10 years. Options generally vest equally over three years. Restricted stock awards generally vest over 3 years, with no more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year upon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target. Restricted stock units vest over three years and upon vesting, the recipient receives one share of Abbott stock for each vested restricted stock unit. The aggregate fair market value of restricted stock awards and units is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which may be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant. Restricted stock awards and settlement of vested restricted stock units are issued out of treasury shares. Abbott generally issues new shares for exercises of stock options. As a policy, Abbott does not purchase its shares relating to its share-based programs. In April 2017, Abbott's shareholders authorized the 2017 Incentive Stock Program under which a maximum of 170 million shares were available for issuance. At December 31, 2018, approximately 144 million shares remained available for future issuance. In connection with the completion of the St. Jude Medical acquisition in the first quarter of 2017, unvested St. Jude Medical stock options and restricted stock units were assumed by Abbott and converted into Abbott options and restricted stock units (as applicable) of substantially equivalent value, in accordance with the merger agreement. The number of shares underlying the converted options was 7,364,571 at a weighted average exercise price of $30.50. The number of restricted stock units converted was 2,324,500 at a weighted average grant date fair value of $37.69. 73 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 10  Incentive Stock Program (Continued) The number of restricted stock awards and units outstanding and the weighted-average grant-date fair value at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 15,952,602 and $52.11 and 15,518,719 and $42.82, respectively. The number of restricted stock awards and units, and the weighted-average grant-date fair value, that were granted, vested and lapsed during 2018 were 8,964,877 and $60.10, 7,522,375 and $42.85 and 1,008,619 and $49.27, respectively. The fair market value of restricted stock awards and units vested in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $458 million, $348 million and $225 million, respectively. December 31, 2017 Granted Exercised Lapsed December 31, 2018 The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2018 were $996 million and $743 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $249 million, $233 million and $98 million, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to all share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2018 amounted to approximately $364 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next three years. Total non-cash stock compensation expense charged against income from continuing operations in 2018, 2017 and 2016 for share-based plans totaled approximately $477 million, $406 million and $310 million, respectively, and the tax benefit recognized was approximately $185 million, $242 million and $100 million, respectively. The decrease in the tax benefit in 2018 primarily relates to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The increase in the 2017 tax benefit primarily relates to the $120 million of tax benefit recorded in income after the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Stock compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory is not significant. The fair value of an option granted in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $10.93, $6.54, and $4.38, respectively. The fair value of an option grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: Risk-free interest rate Average life of options (years) Volatility Dividend yield The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates available at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option's expected life. The average life of an option is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Abbott's stock and historical volatility of Abbott's stock over the expected life of the option. Dividend yield is based on the option's exercise price and annual dividend rate at the time of grant. 74 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11  Debt and Lines of Credit The following is a summary of long-term debt at December 31: ( in millions ) 5.125% Notes, due 2019 2.35% Notes, due 2019 2.50% Line of credit borrowing due 2019 0.00% Notes, due 2020 2.80% Notes, due 2020 4.125% Notes, due 2020 2.00% Notes, due 2020 2.90% Notes, due 2021 2.55% Notes, due 2022 2.62% Term loan due 2022 0.875% Notes, due 2023 3.25% Notes, due 2023 3.40% Notes, due 2023 3.875% Notes, due 2025 2.95% Notes, due 2025 1.50% Notes, due 2026 3.75% Notes, due 2026 4.75% Notes, due 2036 6.15% Notes, due 2037 6.00% Notes, due 2039 5.30% Notes, due 2040 4.75% Notes, due 2043 4.90% Notes, due 2046 Unamortized debt issuance costs Other, including fair value adjustments relating to interest rate hedge contracts designated as fair value hedges Total, net of current maturities Current maturities of long-term debt Total carrying amount On February 16, 2018, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. Redemptions under this authorization include the following: 75 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11  Debt and Lines of Credit (Continued) On January 25, 2019, Abbott gave notice to the holders of its 2.80% Notes due 2020, that it will redeem the $500 million outstanding principal amount of these notes on February 24, 2019. After the redemption of the 2.80% Notes, approximately $700 million of the $5 billion debt redemption authorization noted above will remain available. Abbott incurred a net charge of $14 million related to the March 22, 2018 early repayment of debt. On September 17, 2018, Abbott repaid upon maturity the $500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2.00% Senior Notes due 2018. On September 27, 2018, Abbott's wholly owned subsidiary, Abbott Ireland Financing DAC, completed a euro debt offering of €3.420 billion of long-term debt consisting of €1.140 billion of non-interest bearing Senior Notes due 2020 at 99.727% of par value; €1.140 billion of 0.875% Senior Notes due 2023 at 99.912% of par value; and €1.140 billion of 1.50% Senior Notes due 2026 at 99.723% of par value. The proceeds equated to approximately $4 billion. The notes are guaranteed by Abbott. On October 28, 2018, Abbott redeemed approximately $4 billion of debt, which included $750 million principal amount of its 2.00% Notes due 2020; $597 million principal amount of its 4.125% Notes due 2020; $900 million principal amount of its 3.25% Notes due 2023; $450 million principal amount of its 3.4% Notes due 2023; and $1.300 billion principal amount of its 3.75% Notes due 2026. These amounts are in addition to the $5 billion authorization discussed above. In conjunction with the redemption, Abbott unwound approximately $1.1 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 3.40% Note due in 2023 and the 3.75% Note due in 2026. Abbott incurred a net charge of $153 million related to the early repayment of this debt and the unwinding of related interest rate swaps. On November 30, 2018, Abbott entered into a Five Year Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) and terminated the 2014 revolving credit agreement. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2014 revolving credit agreement at the time of its termination. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will mature and be payable on November 30, 2023. Any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest, at Abbott's option, based on either a base rate or Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott's credit ratings. In the first quarter of 2017, as part of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Abbott's long-term debt increased due to the assumption of outstanding debt previously issued by St. Jude Medical. Abbott exchanged certain St. Jude Medical debt obligations with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $2.9 billion for debt issued by Abbott which consists of: 2.00% Senior Notes due 2018 2.80% Senior Notes due 2020 3.25% Senior Notes due 2023 3.875% Senior Notes due 2025 4.75% Senior Notes due 2043 Following this exchange, approximately $194.2 million of existing St. Jude Medical notes remained outstanding across the five series of existing notes which have the same coupons and maturities as those listed above. There were no significant costs associated with the exchange of debt. In addition, during the 76 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11  Debt and Lines of Credit (Continued) first quarter of 2017, Abbott assumed and subsequently repaid approximately $2.8 billion of various St. Jude Medical debt obligations. On January 4, 2017, as part of funding the cash portion of the St. Jude Medical acquisition, Abbott borrowed $2.0 billion under a 120-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility. This facility was repaid during the first quarter of 2017. In 2017, Abbott issued 364-day yen-denominated debt, of which $199 million and $195 million was outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2017, Abbott also paid off a $479 million yen-denominated short-term borrowing during the year. On July 31, 2017, Abbott entered into a 5-year term loan agreement that allowed Abbott to borrow up to $2.8 billion on an unsecured basis for the acquisition of Alere. On October 3, 2017, Abbott borrowed $2.8 billion under this term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of Alere, to repay certain indebtedness of Abbott and Alere, and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition. Borrowings under the term loan bore interest based on a Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott paid off this term loan on January 5, 2018. On October 3, 2017 Abbott borrowed $1.7 billion under its lines of credit. Proceeds from such borrowing were used to finance the acquisition of Alere, to repay certain indebtedness of Abbott and Alere, and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition. These lines of credit were part of a 2014 revolving credit agreement that provided Abbott with the ability to borrow up to $5 billion on an unsecured basis. Advances under the revolving credit agreement, including the $1.7 billion borrowing in October 2017, were scheduled to mature and be payable on July 10, 2019. The $1.7 billion borrowing bore interest based on a Eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin based on Abbott's credit ratings. Prior to October 3, 2017, no amounts were previously drawn under the revolving credit agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Abbott paid off $550 million on the revolving loan. Abbott paid off the remaining balance on this revolving loan on January 5, 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2017, in conjunction with the acquisition of Alere, Abbott assumed and subsequently repaid $3.0 billion of Alere's debt. In November 2016, Abbott issued $15.1 billion of medium and long-term debt to primarily fund the cash portion of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. Abbott issued $2.85 billion of 2.35% Senior Notes due November 22, 2019; $2.85 billion of 2.90% Senior Notes due November 30, 2021; $1.50 billion of 3.40% Senior Notes due November 30, 2023; $3.00 billion of 3.75% Senior Notes due November 30, 2026; $1.65 billion of 4.75% Senior Notes due November 30, 2036; and $3.25 billion of 4.90% Senior Notes due November 30, 2046. In November 2016, Abbott also entered into interest rate swap contracts totaling $3.0 billion related to the new debt, which have the effect of changing Abbott's obligation from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate obligation on the related debt instruments. In February 2016, Abbott obtained a commitment for a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility for an amount not to exceed $9 billion in conjunction with its pending acquisition of Alere. This commitment, which was automatically extended for up to 90 days on January 29, 2017, expired on April 30, 2017 and was not renewed since Abbott did not need this bridge facility to finance the Alere acquisition. The fees associated with the bridge facilities were recognized in interest expense. 77 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 11  Debt and Lines of Credit (Continued) Principal payments required on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2018 are $7 million in 2019, $1.8 billion in 2020, $2.9 billion in 2021, $750 million in 2022, $2.3 billion in 2023 and $11.8 billion in 2024 and thereafter. At December 31, 2018, Abbott's long-term debt rating was BBB by Standard & Poor's Corporation and Baa1 by Moody's. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2023 and support commercial paper borrowing arrangements. Abbott's weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings was 0.4% at December 31, 2018, 0.3% at December 31, 2017 and 0.6% at December 31, 2016. Note 12  Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $5.1 billion at December 31, 2018, and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2017, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of December 31, 2018 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months. Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, Abbott held gross notional amounts of $13.6 billion, $20.1 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. In March 2017, Abbott repaid its $479 million foreign denominated short-term debt which was designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary. At December 31, 2016, the value of this short-term debt was $454 million and changes in the fair value of the debt up through the date of repayment due to changes in exchange rates were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $2.9 billion at December 31, 2018, $4.0 billion at December 31, 2017 and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2016, to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. In October 2018, Abbott unwound approximately $1.1 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 3.40% Note due in 2023 and the 3.75% Note due in 2026. As a part of the unwinding, Abbott paid approximately $90 million in cash, which was included in the Financing Activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in 2018. 78 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 12  Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) In the second quarter of 2017, Abbott unwound approximately $1.5 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 2.00% Note due in 2020 and the 2.55% Note due in 2022. The proceeds received were not significant. In December 2016, Abbott unwound approximately $1.5 billion in interest rate swaps relating to the 4.125% Note due in 2020 and the 5.125% Note due in 2019. As part of the unwinding, Abbott received approximately $55 million in cash, which was included in the Financing Activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in 2016. The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of December 31: Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges Foreign currency forward exchange contracts  Hedging instruments Others not designated as hedges The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges Losses of $100 million and $64 million, and gains of $8 million were recognized in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as hedges. These amounts are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line. The interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The hedged debt is marked to market, offsetting the effect of marking the interest rate swaps to market. The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of December 31 are shown in the table below. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values. 79 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 12  Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions. Abbott does not expect any losses from nonperformance by these counterparties. Long-term Investment Securities: Equity securities Other Total Long-Term Debt Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts: Receivable position (Payable) position Interest Rate Hedge Contracts: (Payable) position The following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheet: December 31, 2018: Equity securities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts Total Assets Fair value of hedged long-term debt Interest rate swap financial instruments Foreign currency forward exchange contracts Contingent consideration related to business combinations Total Liabilities December 31, 2017: Equity securities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts Total Assets Fair value of hedged long-term debt Interest rate swap financial instruments Foreign currency forward exchange contracts Contingent consideration related to business combinations Total Liabilities The fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts is determined using a market approach, which utilizes values for comparable derivative instruments. The fair value of the debt was determined based 80 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 12  Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. Contingent consideration relates to businesses acquired by Abbott. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals, at the time of the business acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. The maximum amount for certain contingent consideration is not determinable as it is based on a percent of certain sales. Excluding such contingent consideration, the maximum amount estimated to be due is approximately $480 million, which is dependent upon attaining certain sales thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events, such as regulatory approvals. Note 13  Litigation and Environmental Matters Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $10 million. Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $125 million to $165 million. The recorded accrual balance at December 31, 2018 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $145 million. This accrual represents management's best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, ""Contingencies."" Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. 81 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14  Post-Employment Benefits Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution and medical and dental plans. Information for Abbott's major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: Projected benefit obligations, January 1 Service cost  benefits earned during the year Interest cost on projected benefit obligations (Gains) losses, primarily changes in discount rates, plan design changes, law changes and differences between actual and estimated health care costs Benefits paid Other, including foreign currency translation Projected benefit obligations, December 31 Plan assets at fair value, January 1 Actual return (loss) on plans' assets Company contributions Benefits paid Other, including foreign currency translation Plan assets at fair value, December 31 Projected benefit obligations greater than plan assets, December 31 Long-term assets Short-term liabilities Long-term liabilities Net liability Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (loss): Actuarial losses, net Prior service cost (credits) Total The projected benefit obligations for non-U.S. defined benefit plans was $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligations for all defined benefit plans were $8.3 billion and $8.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 82 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14  Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) For plans where the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded plan assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligations, the projected benefit obligations and the aggregate plan assets were as follows: Accumulated benefit obligation Projected benefit obligation Fair value of plan assets The components of the net periodic benefit cost were as follows: Service cost  benefits earned during the year Interest cost on projected benefit obligations Expected return on plans' assets Amortization of actuarial losses Amortization of prior service cost (credits) Total cost In 2017, Abbott recognized a $10 million curtailment gain related to the sale of AMO. Other comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year includes the amortization of actuarial losses and prior service costs (credits) as noted in the previous table. Other comprehensive income (loss) for each respective year also includes: net actuarial losses of $86 million for defined benefit plans and a gain of $53 million for medical and dental plans in 2018; net actuarial losses of $247 million for defined benefit plans and $97 million for medical and dental plans in 2017; net actuarial losses of $571 million for defined benefit plans and $20 million for medical and dental plans in 2016. The pretax amount of actuarial losses and prior service cost (credits) included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2018 that is expected to be recognized in the net periodic benefit cost in 2019 is $130 million and $1 million of expense, respectively, for defined benefit pension plans and $24 million of expense and $32 million of income, respectively, for medical and dental plans. The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows: Discount rate Expected aggregate average long-term change in compensation 83 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14  Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) The weighted average assumptions used to determine the net cost for defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans are as follows: Discount rate Expected return on plan assets Expected aggregate average long-term change in compensation The assumed health care cost trend rates for medical and dental plans at December 31 were as follows: Health care cost trend rate assumed for the next year Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to Year that rate reaches the assumed ultimate rate The discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high-quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits. The health care cost trend rates represent Abbott's expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and are forward projections of health care costs as of the measurement date. A one-percentage point increase/(decrease) in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase/(decrease) the accumulated post-employment benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018, by $157 million /$(131) million, and the total of the service and interest cost components of net post-employment health care cost for the year then ended by approximately $12 million/$(10) million. 84 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14  Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) The following table summarizes the basis used to measure the defined benefit and medical and dental plan assets at fair value: December 31, 2018: Equities: U.S. large cap (a) U.S. mid and small cap (b) International (c) Fixed income securities: U.S. government securities (d) Corporate debt instruments (e) Non-U.S. government securities (f) Other (g) Absolute return funds (h) Commodities (i) Cash and Cash Equivalents Other (j) December 31, 2017: Equities: U.S. large cap (a) U.S. mid and small cap (b) International (c) Fixed income securities: U.S. government securities (d) Corporate debt instruments (e) Non-U.S. government securities (f) Other (g) Absolute return funds (h) Commodities (i) Cash and Cash Equivalents Other (j) 85 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14  Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) Equities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at the net asset value (NAV) provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. For approximately half of these funds, investments may be redeemed once per month, with a required 7 to 30 day notice period. For the remaining funds, daily redemption of an investment is allowed. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry recognized vendors. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to fixed income funds at December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the majority of these funds, investments may be redeemed either weekly or monthly, with a required 2 to 14 day notice period. For the remaining funds, investments may be generally redeemed daily. Absolute return funds and commodities are valued at the NAV provided by the fund administrator. All private funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund on a one-quarter lag adjusted for known cash flows and significant events through the reporting date. Abbott did not have any unfunded commitments related to absolute return funds at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Investments in these funds may be generally redeemed monthly or quarterly with required notice periods ranging from 5 to 45 days. For approximately $100 million of the absolute return funds, redemptions are subject to a 25 percent gate. For commodities, investments in the private energy funds cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2019 to 2022. Abbott's unfunded commitments in these funds as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were not 86 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 14  Post-Employment Benefits (Continued) significant. Investments in the private funds (excluding private energy funds) cannot be redeemed but the funds will make distributions through liquidation. The estimate of the liquidation period for each fund ranges from 2019 to 2028. Abbott's unfunded commitment in these funds was $518 million and $489 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The investment mix of equity securities, fixed income and other asset allocation strategies is based upon achieving a desired return, as well as balancing higher return, more volatile equity securities with lower return, less volatile fixed income securities. Investment allocations are made across a range of markets, industry sectors, capitalization sizes, and in the case of fixed income securities, maturities and credit quality. The plans do not directly hold any securities of Abbott. There are no known significant concentrations of risk in the plans' assets. Abbott's medical and dental plans' assets are invested in a similar mix as the pension plan assets. The actual asset allocation percentages at year end are consistent with the company's targeted asset allocation percentages. The plans' expected return on assets, as shown above is based on management's expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios. In establishing this assumption, management considers historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested, as well as current economic and capital market conditions. Abbott funds its domestic pension plans according to IRS funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. Abbott funded $114 million in 2018 and $645 million in 2017 to defined pension plans. Abbott expects to contribute approximately $380 million to its pension plans in 2019. Total benefit payments expected to be paid to participants, which includes payments funded from company assets, as well as paid from the plans, are as follows: 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 to 2028 The Abbott Stock Retirement Plan is the principal defined contribution plan. Abbott's contributions to this plan were $146 million in 2018, $79 million in 2017 and $83 million in 2016. The 2018 contributions include amounts related to participants of the St. Jude Medical Retirement Plan which was terminated in January 2018. Note 15  Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the annual effective rates, including charges for interest and penalties. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax 87 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15  Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued) on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2018, Abbott has completed its accounting for all of the enactment date income tax effects of the TCJA. If additional regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury after December 31, 2018 result in a change in judgment, the effect of such regulations will be accounted for in the period in which the regulations are finalized. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, the TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. In January 2018, the FASB staff provided guidance that an entity may make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes related to items that will give rise to GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year that the tax is incurred. Abbott has elected to treat the GILTI tax as a period expense and provide for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Abbott recorded an estimate of net tax expense of $1.46 billion for the impact of the TCJA, which was included in Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The estimate was provisional and included a charge of approximately $2.89 billion for the transition tax, partially offset by a net benefit of approximately $1.42 billion for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a net benefit of approximately $10 million related to certain other impacts of the TCJA. In 2018, Abbott recorded $130 million of additional tax expense which increased the final tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.59 billion. The $130 million of additional tax expense reflects a $120 million increase in the transition tax from $2.89 billion to $3.01 billion and a $10 million reduction in the net benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The one-time transition tax is based on Abbott's total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The tax computation also requires the determination of the amount of post-1986 E&P considered held in cash and other specified assets. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining balance of Abbott's transition tax obligation is approximately $1.58 billion, which will be paid over the next eight years as allowed by the TCJA. In 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations includes $98 million of net tax expense related to the settlement of Abbott's 2014-2016 federal income tax audit in the U.S., partial settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group's 2014 and 2015 federal income tax returns in the U.S. and audit settlements in various countries. In 2017, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included $435 million of tax expense related to the gain on the sale of the AMO business. In 2016, taxes on earnings from continuing operations included the impact of a net tax benefit of approximately $225 million, primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions from prior years, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of non-deductible foreign exchange losses related to Venezuela and the adjustment of the Mylan N.V. equity investment, as well as the recognition of deferred taxes associated with the then pending sale of AMO. Undistributed foreign earnings remain indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in its foreign entities is not practicable. In the U.S., Abbott's federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2014 and the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. There are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which are individually significant. Reserves for interest and penalties are not significant. 88 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15  Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued) Earnings from continuing operations before taxes, and the related provisions for taxes on earnings from continuing operations, were as follows: Earnings From Continuing Operations Before Taxes: Domestic Foreign Total Taxes on Earnings From Continuing Operations: Current: Domestic Foreign Total current Deferred: Domestic Foreign Total deferred Total Differences between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate were as follows: Statutory tax rate on earnings from continuing operations Impact of foreign operations Impact of TCJA and other related items Foreign-derived intangible income benefit Domestic impairment loss Excess tax benefits related to stock compensation Research tax credit Resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years Mylan share adjustment State taxes, net of federal benefit Federal tax cost on sale of Mylan N.V. shares All other, net Effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations Impact of foreign operations is primarily derived from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Costa Rica, and Singapore. 89 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 15  Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations (Continued) The tax effect of the differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows: Deferred tax assets: Compensation and employee benefits Other, primarily reserves not currently deductible, and NOL's and credit carryforwards Trade receivable reserves Inventory reserves Deferred intercompany profit Total deferred tax assets before valuation allowance Valuation allowance Total deferred tax assets Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation Other, primarily the excess of book basis over tax basis of intangible assets Total deferred tax liabilities Total net deferred tax assets (liabilities) Abbott has incurred losses in a foreign jurisdiction where realization of the future economic benefit is so remote that the benefit is not reflected as a deferred tax asset. The following table summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such unrecognized tax benefits were settled: January 1 Decrease in tax positions due to acquisitions Increase in tax positions due to acquisitions Increase due to current year tax positions Increase due to prior year tax positions Decrease due to prior year tax positions Settlements Lapse of statute December 31 The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate is approximately $1.02 billion. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within a range of $125 million to $350 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. 90 Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) Note 16  Segment and Geographic Area Information Abbott's principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.

Abbott's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company's management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Abbott's management assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2018, the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. Abbott's independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 97. Miles D. White Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Brian B. Yoor Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer Robert E. Funck Senior Vice President, Finance and Controller February 22, 2019 95 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""consolidated financial statements""). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 22, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2013. Chicago, Illinois February 22, 2019 96 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Abbott Laboratories Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Abbott Laboratories and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders' investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 97 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Chicago, Illinois February 22, 2019 98 ITEM 9.
