Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. Comparable sales excluding fuel is also an important, separate metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs without considering fuel, which is volatile and unpredictable. Other companies in our industry may calculate comparable sales differently, limiting the comparability of the metric. 11 Walmart Inc. Reconciliations of and Other Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) The following information provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company has provided the non-GAAP financial information presented in the press release, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release. The non-GAAP financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies. Constant currency In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues, net sales and operating income for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023.

N/A - Not applicable 12 Adjusted operating income Adjusted operating income is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain charges included in operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that adjusted operating income is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, adjusted operating income affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance as compared with that of the prior year. When we refer to adjusted operating income in constant currency, this means adjusted operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The tables below reflect the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income in constant currency for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 .

NP - Not provided 13 Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $3.3 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to timing of certain payments and moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges. Free cash flow for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was $4.3 billion, which represents an increase of $0.7 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash flow is due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $2.6 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, Walmart’s definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company’s free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart’s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Nine Months Ended October 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 19,014 $ 15,698 Payments for property and equipment (capital expenditures) (14,674) (12,061) Free cash flow $ 4,340 $ 3,637 Net cash used in investing activities 1 $ (15,374) $ (12,965) Net cash used in financing activities (179) (5,581) 1 ""Net Cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow . 14 Adjusted EPS Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the prior year. We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity and other investments each quarter because although the investments are strategic decisions for the company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily focused on the operational results rather than the fair value of such investments. Additionally, management does not forecast changes in the fair value of its equity and other investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the unrealized and realized gains and losses related to those equity investments. We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023 by adjusting EPS for the following: 1. unrealized and realized gains and losses on the Company’s equity and other investments; and 2. incremental opioid settlement expense. Three Months Ended October 31, 2023 4 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $0.17 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1,2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments 5 1.76 (0.41) 0.01 1.36 Adjusted EPS $1.53 Nine Months Ended October 31, 2023 4 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $3.71 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1,2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments 6 1.45 (0.34) — 1.11 Incremental opioid settlement expense 0.04 (0.01) — 0.03 Net adjustments $1.14 Adjusted EPS $4.85 1 Tax impact calculated based on nature of item, including any realizable deductions, and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdictions. 2 The reported effective tax rate was 29.7% and 26.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. Adjusted for the above items, the effective tax rate was 24.1% and 25.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. 3 Calculated based on the ownership percentages of our noncontrolling interests. 4 Quarterly adjustments or adjusted EPS may not sum to YTD adjustments or YTD adjusted EPS due to rounding. Additionally, the individual components in the tables above may include immaterial rounding. 5 For the three months ended October 31, 2023, net losses were primarily driven by decreases in the underlying stock prices of our investments in JD.com and Symbotic. 6 For the nine months ended October 31, 2023, net losses were primarily driven by a decrease in the underlying stock price of our investment in JD.com, partially offset by an increase in the underlying stock price of our investment in Symbotic. 15 As previously disclosed in our third quarter ended October 31, 2022 press release, we have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 by adjusting EPS for the following: (1) unrealized and realized gains and losses on the company’s equity and other investments; (2) gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil; (3) a discrete tax item; and (4) opioid legal charges. Three Months Ended October 31, 2022 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $(0.66) Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1, 2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments 6 $1.34 $(0.24) $0.01 $1.11 Opioid legal charges 1.22 (0.17) — 1.05 Net adjustments 4 $2.16 Adjusted EPS 4 $1.50 Nine Months Ended October 31, 2022 5 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $1.97 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1, 2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments 6 $2.18 $(0.40) $— $1.78 Gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil (0.16) — — (0.16) Discrete tax item — (0.06) — (0.06) Opioid legal charges 1.21 (0.17) — 1.04 Net adjustments $2.60 Adjusted EPS $4.57 1 Tax impact calculated based on nature of item, including any realizable deductions, and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdictions. No tax expense was incurred in connection with the gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil. 2 The reported effective tax rate was (23.5%) and 32.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. Adjusted for the above items, the effective tax rate was 25.9% and 25.7% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. 3 Calculated based on the ownership percentages of our noncontrolling interests. 4 Adjusted EPS for the three months ended October 31, 2022 was calculated using weighted average shares outstanding of 2,720 million, which includes the dilutive impact of share-based payment awards . 5 Quarterly adjustments or adjusted EPS may not sum to YTD adjustments or YTD adjusted EPS due to rounding. 6 For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, net losses were primarily driven by decreases in the underlying stock price of our investment in JD.com. 16 Return on investment We include return on assets (""ROA""), which is calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") as well as return on investment (""ROI"") as measures to assess returns on assets. Management believes ROI is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROA was 6.5 percent and 3.7 percent for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to an increase in consolidated net income during the trailing twelve month period primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period. ROI was 14.1 percent and 12.8 percent for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROI was the result of an increase in operating income primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period, partially offset by an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. 17 The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA is as follows: CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Trailing Twelve Months Ended October 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 16,401 $ 9,116 Denominator Average total assets 1 253,415 246,254 Return on assets (ROA) 6.5 % 3.7 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 25,319 $ 20,754 + Interest income 504 196 + Depreciation and amortization 11,547 10,840 + Rent 2,286 2,296 ROI operating income $ 39,656 $ 34,086 Denominator Average total assets 1 $ 253,415 $ 246,254 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization 1 112,875 103,898 ' - Average accounts payable 1 59,156 57,210 ' - Average accrued liabilities 1 26,788 25,959 Average invested capital $ 280,346 $ 266,983 Return on investment (ROI) 14.1 % 12.8 % October 31, Certain Balance Sheet Data 2023 2022 2021 Total assets $ 259,174 $ 247,656 $ 244,851 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 118,122 107,628 100,168 Accounts payable 61,049 57,263 57,156 Accrued liabilities 26,132 27,443 24,474 1 The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. 18 -;-EX-99.2:EX-99.2 3 earningspresentationfy24.htm EARNINGS PRESENTATION earningspresentationfy24 Financial presentation to accompany management commentary FY24 Q3 The following guidance reflects the Company’s expectations for fiscal year 2024 and is provided on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements that are included in reported GAAP results, such as the changes in fair value of the Company’s equity and other investments.

Non-GAAP measures – ROI We include return on assets (""ROA""), which is calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") as well as return on investment (""ROI"") as measures to assess returns on assets. Management believes ROI is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROA was 6.5% percent and 3.7% percent for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to an increase in consolidated net income during the trailing twelve month period primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period. ROI was 14.1% and 12.8% for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROI was the result of an increase in operating income primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period, partially offset by an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, is as follows: Non-GAAP measures – ROI (cont.)

Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $3.3 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to timing of certain payments and moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges. Free cash flow for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was $4.3 billion, which represents an increase of $0.7 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash flow is due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $2.6 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, Walmart’s definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company’s free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart’s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. Non-GAAP measures – free cash flow (cont.) The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.

NM = not meaningful Non-GAAP measures – constant currency In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for net sales for the Walmart International segment for the trailing five quarters and operating income for the current quarter.

NP = not provided Non-GAAP measures – adjusted EPS Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the prior year. We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity and other investments each quarter because although the investments are strategic decisions for the company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily focused on the operational results rather than the fair value of such investments. Additionally, management does not forecast changes in the fair value of its equity and other investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the unrealized and realized gains and losses related to those equity investments. We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the trailing five quarters as well as the prior year comparable periods by adjusting EPS for the relevant adjustments for each period presented.

Non-GAAP measures – adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin The calculation of net income (loss) margin and adjusted EBITDA margin, along with a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA margin to the calculation of net income (loss) margin, is as follows: Three Months Ended Q3 FY24 Q3 FY23 (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Walmart $ 453 $ (1,798) Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (190) (31) Provision for income taxes 272 336 Other (gains) and losses 4,750 3,626 Interest, Net 537 500 Operating Income $ 6,202 $ 2,695 + Depreciation and Amortization 2,986 2,755 + Opioid legal charges — 3,325 Adjusted EBITDA $ 9,188 $ 8,775 Net Sales $ 159,439 $ 151,469 Consolidated net income (loss) margin 0.3 % -1.2 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 5.8 % 5.8 % We include net income (loss) and net income (loss) margin, which are calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principle as well as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to provide meaningful information about our operational efficiency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of certain items. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We also exclude other gains and losses, which is primarily comprised of fair value adjustments on our investments which management does not believe are indicative of our core business performance. From time to time, we will also adjust certain items from operating income, which we believe is meaningful because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by consolidated net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes, however, that these measures provide meaningful information about our operational efficiency by excluding the impact of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, capital investments and other items which management does not believe are indicative of our core business performance. We consider net income (loss) to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of adjusted EBITDA. We consider net income (loss) margin to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of adjusted EBITDA margin. Although adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are standard financial measures, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate similarly titled measures. Net income (loss) margin was 0.3% and -1.2% for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in net income margin was primarily due to the increase in net income primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in Q3 FY23. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.8% for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained relatively flat as the increase in adjusted EBITDA was offset by the increase in net sales. -;-",0000104169,WMT,"8-K:8-K 1 wmt-20231116.htm 8-K wmt-20231116 0000104169 false 0000104169 2023-11-16 2023-11-16 0000104169 wmt:CommonStockparvalue0.10pershareMember 2023-11-16 2023-11-16 0000104169 wmt:A2.550NotesDue2026Member 2023-11-16 2023-11-16 0000104169 wmt:A1050NotesDue2026Member 2023-11-16 2023-11-16 0000104169 wmt:A1500NotesDue2028Member 2023-11-16 2023-11-16 0000104169 wmt:A4875NotesDue2029Member 2023-11-16 2023-11-16 0000104169 wmt:A5750NotesDue2030Member 2023-11-16 2023-11-16 0000104169 wmt:A1800NotesDue2031Member 2023-11-16 2023-11-16 0000104169 wmt:A5625NotesDue2034Member 2023-11-16 2023-11-16 0000104169 wmt:A5250NotesDue2035Member 2023-11-16 2023-11-16 0000104169 wmt:A4875NotesDue2039Member 2023-11-16 2023-11-16 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, DC 20549 ________________________ FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 or 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Date of Report (date of earliest event reported) November 16, 2023 Walmart Inc.

Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. Comparable sales excluding fuel is also an important, separate metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs without considering fuel, which is volatile and unpredictable. Other companies in our industry may calculate comparable sales differently, limiting the comparability of the metric. 11 Walmart Inc. Reconciliations of and Other Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) The following information provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company has provided the non-GAAP financial information presented in the press release, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release. The non-GAAP financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies. Constant currency In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues, net sales and operating income for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023.

N/A - Not applicable 12 Adjusted operating income Adjusted operating income is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain charges included in operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that adjusted operating income is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, adjusted operating income affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance as compared with that of the prior year. When we refer to adjusted operating income in constant currency, this means adjusted operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The tables below reflect the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income in constant currency for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 . Three Months Ended October 31, Consolidated (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Operating income: Operating income, as reported $ 6,202 $ 2,695 Opioid legal charges 1 — 3,325 Adjusted operating income $ 6,202 $ 6,020 Percent change 2 3.0 % NP Currency exchange rate fluctuations (164) — Adjusted operating income, constant currency $ 6,038 $ 6,020 Percent change 2 0.3 % NP Nine Months Ended October 31, Consolidated (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Operating income: Operating income, as reported $ 19,758 $ 14,867 Opioid legal charges 1 93 3,325 Adjusted operating income $ 19,851 $ 18,192 Percent change 2 9.1 % NP Currency exchange rate fluctuations (360) — Adjusted operating income, constant currency $ 19,491 $ 18,192 Percent change 2 7.1 % NP 1 Recorded in Corporate and support. 2 Change versus prior year comparable period. NP - Not provided 13 Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $3.3 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to timing of certain payments and moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges. Free cash flow for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was $4.3 billion, which represents an increase of $0.7 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash flow is due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $2.6 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, Walmart’s definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company’s free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart’s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Nine Months Ended October 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 19,014 $ 15,698 Payments for property and equipment (capital expenditures) (14,674) (12,061) Free cash flow $ 4,340 $ 3,637 Net cash used in investing activities 1 $ (15,374) $ (12,965) Net cash used in financing activities (179) (5,581) 1 ""Net Cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow . 14 Adjusted EPS Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the prior year. We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity and other investments each quarter because although the investments are strategic decisions for the company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily focused on the operational results rather than the fair value of such investments. Additionally, management does not forecast changes in the fair value of its equity and other investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the unrealized and realized gains and losses related to those equity investments. We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023 by adjusting EPS for the following: 1. unrealized and realized gains and losses on the Company’s equity and other investments; and 2. incremental opioid settlement expense. Three Months Ended October 31, 2023 4 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $0.17 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1,2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments 5 1.76 (0.41) 0.01 1.36 Adjusted EPS $1.53 Nine Months Ended October 31, 2023 4 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $3.71 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1,2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments 6 1.45 (0.34) — 1.11 Incremental opioid settlement expense 0.04 (0.01) — 0.03 Net adjustments $1.14 Adjusted EPS $4.85 1 Tax impact calculated based on nature of item, including any realizable deductions, and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdictions. 2 The reported effective tax rate was 29.7% and 26.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. Adjusted for the above items, the effective tax rate was 24.1% and 25.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. 3 Calculated based on the ownership percentages of our noncontrolling interests. 4 Quarterly adjustments or adjusted EPS may not sum to YTD adjustments or YTD adjusted EPS due to rounding. Additionally, the individual components in the tables above may include immaterial rounding. 5 For the three months ended October 31, 2023, net losses were primarily driven by decreases in the underlying stock prices of our investments in JD.com and Symbotic. 6 For the nine months ended October 31, 2023, net losses were primarily driven by a decrease in the underlying stock price of our investment in JD.com, partially offset by an increase in the underlying stock price of our investment in Symbotic. 15 As previously disclosed in our third quarter ended October 31, 2022 press release, we have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 by adjusting EPS for the following: (1) unrealized and realized gains and losses on the company’s equity and other investments; (2) gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil; (3) a discrete tax item; and (4) opioid legal charges. Three Months Ended October 31, 2022 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $(0.66) Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1, 2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments 6 $1.34 $(0.24) $0.01 $1.11 Opioid legal charges 1.22 (0.17) — 1.05 Net adjustments 4 $2.16 Adjusted EPS 4 $1.50 Nine Months Ended October 31, 2022 5 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $1.97 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1, 2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments 6 $2.18 $(0.40) $— $1.78 Gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil (0.16) — — (0.16) Discrete tax item — (0.06) — (0.06) Opioid legal charges 1.21 (0.17) — 1.04 Net adjustments $2.60 Adjusted EPS $4.57 1 Tax impact calculated based on nature of item, including any realizable deductions, and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdictions. No tax expense was incurred in connection with the gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil. 2 The reported effective tax rate was (23.5%) and 32.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. Adjusted for the above items, the effective tax rate was 25.9% and 25.7% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. 3 Calculated based on the ownership percentages of our noncontrolling interests. 4 Adjusted EPS for the three months ended October 31, 2022 was calculated using weighted average shares outstanding of 2,720 million, which includes the dilutive impact of share-based payment awards . 5 Quarterly adjustments or adjusted EPS may not sum to YTD adjustments or YTD adjusted EPS due to rounding. 6 For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, net losses were primarily driven by decreases in the underlying stock price of our investment in JD.com. 16 Return on investment We include return on assets (""ROA""), which is calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") as well as return on investment (""ROI"") as measures to assess returns on assets. Management believes ROI is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROA was 6.5 percent and 3.7 percent for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to an increase in consolidated net income during the trailing twelve month period primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period. ROI was 14.1 percent and 12.8 percent for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROI was the result of an increase in operating income primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period, partially offset by an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. 17 The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA is as follows: CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Trailing Twelve Months Ended October 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 16,401 $ 9,116 Denominator Average total assets 1 253,415 246,254 Return on assets (ROA) 6.5 % 3.7 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 25,319 $ 20,754 + Interest income 504 196 + Depreciation and amortization 11,547 10,840 + Rent 2,286 2,296 ROI operating income $ 39,656 $ 34,086 Denominator Average total assets 1 $ 253,415 $ 246,254 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization 1 112,875 103,898 ' - Average accounts payable 1 59,156 57,210 ' - Average accrued liabilities 1 26,788 25,959 Average invested capital $ 280,346 $ 266,983 Return on investment (ROI) 14.1 % 12.8 % October 31, Certain Balance Sheet Data 2023 2022 2021 Total assets $ 259,174 $ 247,656 $ 244,851 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 118,122 107,628 100,168 Accounts payable 61,049 57,263 57,156 Accrued liabilities 26,132 27,443 24,474 1 The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. 18 "

Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. Comparable sales excluding fuel is also an important, separate metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs without considering fuel, which is volatile and unpredictable. Other companies in our industry may calculate comparable sales differently, limiting the comparability of the metric. 11 Walmart Inc. Reconciliations of and Other Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) The following information provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company has provided the non-GAAP financial information presented in the press release, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release. The non-GAAP financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies. Constant Currency In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues, net sales and operating income for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023.

N/A - Not applicable 12 Adjusted operating income Adjusted operating income is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain charges included in operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that adjusted operating income is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, adjusted operating income affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance as compared with that of the prior year. When we refer to adjusted operating income in constant currency, this means adjusted operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The table below reflect the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income in constant currency for the three months and three and six months ended July 31, 2023 . Three Months Ended July 31, Consolidated (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Operating income: Operating income, as reported $7,316 $6,854 Incremental opioid settlement expense 1 93 — Adjusted operating income 7,409 6,854 Percent change 2 8.1% NP Currency exchange rate fluctuations (124) — Adjusted operating income, constant currency $7,285 6,854 Percent change 2 6.3% NP Six Months Ended July 31, Consolidated (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Operating income: Operating income, as reported $13,556 $12,172 Incremental opioid settlement expense 1 93 — Adjusted operating income 13,649 12,172 Percent change 2 12.1% NP Currency exchange rate fluctuations (196) — Adjusted operating income, constant currency $13,453 $12,172 Percent change 2 10.5% NP 1 Recorded in Corporate and support. 2 Change versus prior year comparable period. NP - Not provided 13 Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $18.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $9.0 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases and timing of certain payments. Free cash flow for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was $9.0 billion, which represents an increase of $7.2 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash flow is due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $1.7 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, Walmart’s definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company’s free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart’s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Six Months Ended July 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 18,201 $ 9,240 Payments for property and equipment (capital expenditures) (9,216) (7,492) Free cash flow $ 8,985 $ 1,748 Net cash used in investing activities 1 $ (9,909) $ (8,584) Net cash used in financing activities (3,309) (1,400) 1 ""Net Cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow . 14 Adjusted EPS Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the prior year. We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity and other investments each quarter because although the investments are strategic decisions for the company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily focused on the operational results rather than the fair value of such investments. Additionally, management does not forecast changes in the fair value of its equity and other investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the realized and unrealized gains and losses related to those equity investments. We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023 by adjusting EPS for the following: 1. unrealized and realized gains and losses on the Company’s equity and other investments; and 2. incremental opioid settlement expense. Three Months Ended July 31, 2023 4 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $2.92 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1,2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments 5 $(1.44) $0.33 $— $(1.11) Incremental opioid settlement expense 0.04 (0.01) — 0.03 Net adjustments $(1.08) Adjusted EPS $1.84 Six Months Ended July 31, 2023 4 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $3.54 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1,2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments $(0.31) $0.06 $(0.01) $(0.26) Incremental opioid settlement expense 0.04 (0.01) — 0.03 Net adjustments $(0.23) Adjusted EPS $3.31 1 Tax impact calculated based on nature of item, including any realizable deductions, and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdictions. 2 The reported effective tax rate was 24.9% and 25.8% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively. Adjusted for the above items, the effective tax rate was 25.8% and 26.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively. 3 Calculated based on the ownership percentages of our noncontrolling interests. 4 Quarterly adjustments or adjusted EPS may not sum to YTD adjustments or YTD adjusted EPS due to rounding. Additionally, the individual components in the tables above may include immaterial rounding. 5 For the three months ended July 31, 2023, unrealized gains were primarily driven by increases in the underlying stock prices of our investments in Symbotic and JD.com. 15 As previously disclosed in our second quarter ended July 31, 2022 press release, we have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022 by adjusting EPS for the following: (1) unrealized and realized gains and losses on the company’s equity and other investments; (2) gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil; and (3) a discrete tax item. Three Months Ended July 31, 2022 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $1.88 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1, 2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments $0.14 $(0.02) $(0.01) $0.11 Gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil (0.16) — — (0.16) Discrete tax item — (0.06) — (0.06) Net adjustments $(0.11) Adjusted EPS $1.77 Six Months Ended July 31, 2022 4 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $2.61 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1, 2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments $0.85 $(0.16) $(0.01) $0.68 Gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil (0.16) — — (0.16) Discrete tax item — (0.06) — (0.06) Net adjustments $0.46 Adjusted EPS $3.07 1 Tax impact calculated based on nature of item, including any realizable deductions, and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdictions. No tax expense was incurred in connection with the gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil. 2 The reported effective tax rate was 22.5% and 24.0% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively. Adjusted for the above item, the effective tax rate was 26.2% and 25.6% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively. 3 Calculated based on the ownership percentages of our noncontrolling interests. 4 Quarterly adjustments or adjusted EPS may not sum to YTD adjustments or YTD adjusted EPS due to rounding. 16 Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), which is calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") as well as Return on Investment (""ROI"") as measures to assess returns on assets. Management believes ROI is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROA was 5.6 percent and 5.8 percent for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the increase in average total assets driven by higher purchases of property and equipment. ROI was 12.8 percent and 13.8 percent for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROI was the result of a decrease in operating income primarily due to opioid legal charges and reorganization and restructuring charges recorded in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2023 respectively, as well as an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. 17 The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA is as follows: CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Trailing Twelve Months Ended July 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 13,991 $ 14,015 Denominator Average total assets 1 251,160 242,876 Return on assets (ROA) 5.6 % 5.8 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 21,812 $ 23,851 + Interest income 442 155 + Depreciation and amortization 11,318 10,733 + Rent 2,284 2,302 ROI operating income $ 35,856 $ 37,041 Denominator Average total assets 1 $ 251,160 $ 242,876 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization 1 110,921 102,155 ' - Average accounts payable 1 55,384 51,896 ' - Average accrued liabilities 1 26,541 23,878 Average invested capital $ 280,156 $ 269,257 Return on investment (ROI) 12.8 % 13.8 % July 31, Certain Balance Sheet Data 2023 2022 2021 Total assets $ 255,121 $ 247,199 $ 238,552 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 115,878 105,963 98,346 Accounts payable 56,576 54,191 49,601 Accrued liabilities 29,239 23,843 23,915 1 The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. 18 -;-EX-99.2:EX-99.2 3 earningspresentationfy24.htm EARNINGS PRESE earningspresentationfy24 Financial presentation to accompany management commentary FY24 Q2 The following guidance reflects the Company’s expectations for the third quarter and fiscal year 2024 and is provided on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements that are included in reported GAAP results, such as the changes in fair value of the Company’s equity and other investments.

Non-GAAP measures - ROI We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), which is calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") as well as Return on Investment (""ROI"") as measures to assess returns on assets. Management believes ROI is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROA was 5.6% percent and 5.8% percent for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the increase in average total assets driven by higher purchases of property and equipment. ROI was 12.8% and 13.8% for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROI was the result of a decrease in operating income primarily due to opioid legal charges and reorganization and restructuring charges recorded in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2023 respectively, as well as an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $18.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $9.0 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases and timing of certain payments. Free cash flow for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was $9.0 billion, which represents an increase of $7.2 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash flow is due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $1.7 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, Walmart’s definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company’s free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart’s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. Non-GAAP measures – free cash flow (cont.) The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.

NM = not meaningful Non-GAAP measures – constant currency In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for net sales for the Walmart International segment for the trailing five quarters and operating income for the current quarter.

In addition, adjusted operating income affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance as compared with that of the prior year. When we refer to adjusted operating income in constant currency, this means adjusted operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The table below reflects the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income in constant currency, when applicable, for the trailing five quarters. 1Business reorganization and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 primarily relate to compensation expenses incurred in connection with the strategic decisions made in the Walmart International segment. Business restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily consist of severance and store closure related costs due to strategic decisions made in the Walmart International segment. 2Recorded in Corporate and support. 3Change versus prior year comparable period. NP = not provided Non-GAAP measures – adjusted EPS Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the prior year. We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity and other investments each quarter because although the investments are strategic decisions for the company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily focused on the operational results rather than the fair value of such investments. Additionally, management does not forecast changes in the fair value of its equity and other investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the realized and unrealized gains and losses related to those equity investments. We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the trailing five quarters as well as the prior year comparable periods by adjusting EPS for the relevant adjustments for each period presented.

We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We also exclude other gains and losses, which is primarily comprised of fair value adjustments on our investments which management does not believe are indicative of our core business performance. From time to time, we will also adjust certain items from operating income, which we believe is meaningful because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by consolidated net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes, however, that these measures provide meaningful information about our operational efficiency by excluding the impact of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, capital investments and other items which management does not believe are indicative of our core business performance. We consider net income to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. We consider net income margin to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin. Although Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are standard financial measures, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate similarly titled measures. Net income margin was 4.9% and 3.4% for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in net income margin was primarily due to the increase in net income, which was impacted by higher unrealized net gains on our equity and other investments, when compared to the same period in the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 6.4% and 6.3% for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin was due to higher operating income driven primarily by an increase in net sales when compared to the same period in the previous year. Non-GAAP measures – Adjusted EBITDA & Adjusted EBITDA margin The calculation of net income margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin, along with a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin to the calculation of net income margin, is as follows: We define adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as well as adjustments for certain items that are excluded from earnings as previously described in the reconciliation for adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that this measure provides meaningful information about our operational efficiency compared with our competitors by excluding the impact of differences in tax jurisdictions and structures, debt levels, capital investments and other items which management does not believe are indicative of our core business performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by consolidated net income. Adjusted EBITDA margin is also considered a non-GAAP financial measure. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income, which is the most comparable GAAP measure for adjusted EBITDA and consolidated net income margin, which is the most comparable GAAP measure for adjusted EBITDA margin. Although other companies report adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, numerous methods may exist for calculating these metrics. As a result, the methods used by Walmart’s management to calculate our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate similarly titled measures.

Around the world, our customers and members are prioritizing value and convenience. They’re shopping with us across channels — in stores, Sam’s Clubs, and they’re driving eCommerce, which was up 24% globally. Food is a strength, but we’re also encouraged by our results in general merchandise versus our expectations when we started the quarter. Our associates helped deliver increases in transaction counts and units sold, and profit is growing faster than sales. We’re in good shape with inventory, and we like our position for the back half of the year.” Doug McMillon President and CEO, Walmart BENTONVILLE, Ark., Aug 17, 2023 – Walmart Inc.

Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. Comparable sales excluding fuel is also an important, separate metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs without considering fuel, which is volatile and unpredictable. Other companies in our industry may calculate comparable sales differently, limiting the comparability of the metric. 11 Walmart Inc. Reconciliations of and Other Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) The following information provides reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in the press release to which this reconciliation is attached to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The company has provided the non-GAAP financial information presented in the press release, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release. The non-GAAP financial measures in the press release may differ from similar measures used by other companies. Constant Currency In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The table below reflects the calculation of constant currency for total revenues, net sales and operating income for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023.

N/A - Not applicable 12 Adjusted operating income Adjusted operating income is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain charges included in operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that adjusted operating income is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, adjusted operating income affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance as compared with that of the prior year. When we refer to adjusted operating income in constant currency, this means adjusted operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results permits investors to better understand Walmart’s underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations. The table below reflect the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income in constant currency for the three months and three and six months ended July 31, 2023 . Three Months Ended July 31, Consolidated (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Operating income: Operating income, as reported $7,316 $6,854 Incremental opioid settlement expense 1 93 — Adjusted operating income 7,409 6,854 Percent change 2 8.1% NP Currency exchange rate fluctuations (124) — Adjusted operating income, constant currency $7,285 6,854 Percent change 2 6.3% NP Six Months Ended July 31, Consolidated (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Operating income: Operating income, as reported $13,556 $12,172 Incremental opioid settlement expense 1 93 — Adjusted operating income 13,649 12,172 Percent change 2 12.1% NP Currency exchange rate fluctuations (196) — Adjusted operating income, constant currency $13,453 $12,172 Percent change 2 10.5% NP 1 Recorded in Corporate and support. 2 Change versus prior year comparable period. NP - Not provided 13 Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $18.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $9.0 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases and timing of certain payments. Free cash flow for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was $9.0 billion, which represents an increase of $7.2 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash flow is due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $1.7 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, Walmart’s definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures, due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company’s free cash flow. As a result, the method used by Walmart’s management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Six Months Ended July 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 18,201 $ 9,240 Payments for property and equipment (capital expenditures) (9,216) (7,492) Free cash flow $ 8,985 $ 1,748 Net cash used in investing activities 1 $ (9,909) $ (8,584) Net cash used in financing activities (3,309) (1,400) 1 ""Net Cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow . 14 Adjusted EPS Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart (Adjusted EPS) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules because it excludes certain amounts included in the diluted earnings per share attributable to Walmart calculated in accordance with GAAP (EPS), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it best allows comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, Adjusted EPS affords investors a view of what management considers Walmart’s core earnings performance and the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the prior year. We adjust for the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our equity and other investments each quarter because although the investments are strategic decisions for the company’s retail operations, management’s measurement of each strategy is primarily focused on the operational results rather than the fair value of such investments. Additionally, management does not forecast changes in the fair value of its equity and other investments. Accordingly, management adjusts EPS each quarter for the realized and unrealized gains and losses related to those equity investments. We have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023 by adjusting EPS for the following: 1. unrealized and realized gains and losses on the Company’s equity and other investments; and 2. incremental opioid settlement expense. Three Months Ended July 31, 2023 4 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $2.92 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1,2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments 5 $(1.44) $0.33 $— $(1.11) Incremental opioid settlement expense 0.04 (0.01) — 0.03 Net adjustments $(1.08) Adjusted EPS $1.84 Six Months Ended July 31, 2023 4 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $3.54 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1,2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments $(0.31) $0.06 $(0.01) $(0.26) Incremental opioid settlement expense 0.04 (0.01) — 0.03 Net adjustments $(0.23) Adjusted EPS $3.31 1 Tax impact calculated based on nature of item, including any realizable deductions, and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdictions. 2 The reported effective tax rate was 24.9% and 25.8% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively. Adjusted for the above items, the effective tax rate was 25.8% and 26.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively. 3 Calculated based on the ownership percentages of our noncontrolling interests. 4 Quarterly adjustments or adjusted EPS may not sum to YTD adjustments or YTD adjusted EPS due to rounding. Additionally, the individual components in the tables above may include immaterial rounding. 5 For the three months ended July 31, 2023, unrealized gains were primarily driven by increases in the underlying stock prices of our investments in Symbotic and JD.com. 15 As previously disclosed in our second quarter ended July 31, 2022 press release, we have calculated Adjusted EPS for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022 by adjusting EPS for the following: (1) unrealized and realized gains and losses on the company’s equity and other investments; (2) gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil; and (3) a discrete tax item. Three Months Ended July 31, 2022 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $1.88 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1, 2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments $0.14 $(0.02) $(0.01) $0.11 Gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil (0.16) — — (0.16) Discrete tax item — (0.06) — (0.06) Net adjustments $(0.11) Adjusted EPS $1.77 Six Months Ended July 31, 2022 4 Diluted earnings per share: Reported EPS $2.61 Adjustments: Pre-Tax Impact Tax Impact 1, 2 NCI Impact 3 Net Impact Unrealized and realized (gains) and losses on equity and other investments $0.85 $(0.16) $(0.01) $0.68 Gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil (0.16) — — (0.16) Discrete tax item — (0.06) — (0.06) Net adjustments $0.46 Adjusted EPS $3.07 1 Tax impact calculated based on nature of item, including any realizable deductions, and statutory rate in effect for relevant jurisdictions. No tax expense was incurred in connection with the gain on sale of equity method investment in Brazil. 2 The reported effective tax rate was 22.5% and 24.0% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively. Adjusted for the above item, the effective tax rate was 26.2% and 25.6% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively. 3 Calculated based on the ownership percentages of our noncontrolling interests. 4 Quarterly adjustments or adjusted EPS may not sum to YTD adjustments or YTD adjusted EPS due to rounding. 16 Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), which is calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") as well as Return on Investment (""ROI"") as measures to assess returns on assets. Management believes ROI is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. We consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROA was 5.6 percent and 5.8 percent for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the increase in average total assets driven by higher purchases of property and equipment. ROI was 12.8 percent and 13.8 percent for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROI was the result of a decrease in operating income primarily due to opioid legal charges and reorganization and restructuring charges recorded in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2023 respectively, as well as an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company’s ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. 17 The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA is as follows: CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Trailing Twelve Months Ended July 31, (Dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 13,991 $ 14,015 Denominator Average total assets 1 251,160 242,876 Return on assets (ROA) 5.6 % 5.8 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 21,812 $ 23,851 + Interest income 442 155 + Depreciation and amortization 11,318 10,733 + Rent 2,284 2,302 ROI operating income $ 35,856 $ 37,041 Denominator Average total assets 1 $ 251,160 $ 242,876 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization 1 110,921 102,155 ' - Average accounts payable 1 55,384 51,896 ' - Average accrued liabilities 1 26,541 23,878 Average invested capital $ 280,156 $ 269,257 Return on investment (ROI) 12.8 % 13.8 % July 31, Certain Balance Sheet Data 2023 2022 2021 Total assets $ 255,121 $ 247,199 $ 238,552 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 115,878 105,963 98,346 Accounts payable 56,576 54,191 49,601 Accrued liabilities 29,239 23,843 23,915 1 The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. 18 "

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results. In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others, net earnings from continuing operations excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as expenses primarily associated with acquisitions and restructuring actions, charges related to cost reduction initiatives, the estimated impact of U.S. tax reform, the acquisition of an R&D asset and the cost associated with the early extinguishment of debt, charges related to impairment of certain assets, and tax benefits associated with specified items and share-based compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs, similar to how Abbott’s management internally assesses performance. Abbott’s management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott’s results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott’s management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

White, chairman and chief executive officer, Abbott. “We’re right on track to achieve ongoing EPS and organic sales growth at the upper-end of our initial guidance ranges for the year.” —more— * See note on organic growth on the next page. THIRD-QUARTER BUSINESS OVERVIEW Note: Management believes that measuring sales growth rates on an organic basis is an appropriate way for investors to best understand the underlying performance of the business. Organic sales growth: Following are sales by business segment and commentary for the third quarter: Total Company ($ in millions) * Total Q3 2019 Abbott sales from continuing operations include Other Sales of $16 million. * Total 9M 2019 Abbott sales from continuing operations include Other Sales of $47 million. n/a = Not Applicable. Note: In order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates, current year U.S. dollar sales are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates. Third-quarter 2019 worldwide sales of $8.1 billion increased 5.5 percent on a reported basis. On an organic basis, worldwide sales increased 7.6 percent. Refer to pages 17 and 18 for a reconciliation of adjusted historical revenue. Nutrition ($ in millions) Worldwide Nutrition sales increased 2.0 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter. On an organic basis, sales increased 3.8 percent. Refer to pages 17 and 18 for a reconciliation of adjusted historical revenue. Worldwide Pediatric Nutrition sales increased 0.5 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 0.9 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 1.4 percent on an organic basis. In the U.S., sales growth was led by Abbott’s market-leading toddler brands, PediaSure ® and Pedialyte ® . International sales declined 2.4 percent on a reported basis and 0.7 percent on an organic basis, driven by challenging market dynamics in Greater China, partially offset by growth across several countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Worldwide Adult Nutrition sales increased 3.9 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter and increased 6.9 percent on an organic basis. International Adult Nutrition sales increased 7.5 percent on a reported basis and 10.4 percent on an organic basis in the third quarter. Sales performance in the quarter was led by strong growth of Ensure ® , Abbott’s market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna ® , Abbott’s market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand. Diagnostics ($ in millions) Worldwide Diagnostics sales increased 4.7 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 1.9 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 6.6 percent on an organic basis. Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 8.3 percent on a reported basis and 10.6 percent on an organic basis in the third quarter. Sales performance was led by above-market growth in the U.S. and internationally, where Abbott is achieving continued strong adoption of its Alinity family of innovative and highly differentiated diagnostic instruments. During the third quarter, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for its Alinity-S blood and plasma screening diagnostics instrument and several testing assays. Molecular Diagnostics sales decreased 7.8 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 1.4 percent effect of foreign exchange, and decreased 6.4 percent on an organic basis. Internationally, sales growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by lower non-governmental organization purchases in Africa. Point of Care Diagnostics sales increased 6.3 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 0.4 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 6.7 percent on an organic basis. Sales growth was led by Abbott’s market-leading i-STAT ® handheld system in the U.S. and internationally. Rapid Diagnostics sales decreased 0.7 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 1.5 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 0.8 percent on an organic basis. Organic sales growth was led by infectious disease testing in developed markets and cardio-metabolic testing globally, partially offset by lower than expected infectious disease testing sales in Africa. Established Pharmaceuticals ($ in millions) Established Pharmaceuticals sales increased 4.4 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 3.5 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 7.9 percent on an organic basis. Key Emerging Markets include India, Brazil, Russia and China along with several additional emerging countries that represent the most attractive long-term growth opportunities for Abbott’s branded generics product portfolio. Sales in these geographies increased 2.8 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter and increased 6.8 percent on an organic basis, which excludes an unfavorable 4.0 percent effect of foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was led by strong growth across several geographies, including India, China and Brazil. Other sales increased 9.2 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 1.7 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 10.9 percent on an organic basis. Medical Devices ($ in millions) — Note: Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) sales, which had previously been reported in Electrophysiology, are now included in Rhythm Management. Historical periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Worldwide Medical Devices sales increased 8.9 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter and increased 10.6 percent on an organic basis, led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. In Electrophysiology, growth was led by strong performance in cardiac diagnostic and ablation catheters, which are used to help physicians accurately and effectively treat atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular heartbeat. In Heart Failure, strong double-digit growth was driven by market adoption of Abbott' s HeartMate 3 ® left ventricular assist device, which has been shown to improve survival and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure. Growth in Structural Heart was led by MitraClip, Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, or a leaky mitral heart valve. In the third quarter, Abbott announced U.S. FDA approval of its next-generation MitraClip device, MitraClip G4, which offers an expanded range of clip sizes, an alternative leaflet grasping feature and facilitation of procedure assessment in real time to offer doctors further options when treating mitral valve disease. In Diabetes Care, sales increased 29.6 percent on a reported basis and 33.1 percent on an organic basis in the third quarter. Sales growth in the quarter was led by FreeStyle Libre, Abbott's revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system, with worldwide sales of $496 million, an increase of 63.1 percent on a reported basis and 67.6 percent on an organic basis versus the prior year. During the third quarter, FreeStyle Libre obtained public reimbursement coverage in Ontario and Quebec, becoming the first and only sensor-based glucose monitoring system to be listed by any provincial health plan in Canada.

THIRD-QUARTER BUSINESS OVERVIEW Note: Management believes that measuring sales growth rates on an organic basis is an appropriate way for investors to best understand the underlying performance of the business. Organic sales growth: Following are sales by business segment and commentary for the third quarter: Total Company ($ in millions) * Total Q3 2019 Abbott sales from continuing operations include Other Sales of $16 million. * Total 9M 2019 Abbott sales from continuing operations include Other Sales of $47 million. n/a = Not Applicable. Note: In order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates, current year U.S. dollar sales are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates. Third-quarter 2019 worldwide sales of $8.1 billion increased 5.5 percent on a reported basis. On an organic basis, worldwide sales increased 7.6 percent. Refer to pages 17 and 18 for a reconciliation of adjusted historical revenue. Nutrition ($ in millions) Worldwide Nutrition sales increased 2.0 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter. On an organic basis, sales increased 3.8 percent. Refer to pages 17 and 18 for a reconciliation of adjusted historical revenue. Worldwide Pediatric Nutrition sales increased 0.5 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 0.9 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 1.4 percent on an organic basis. In the U.S., sales growth was led by Abbott’s market-leading toddler brands, PediaSure ® and Pedialyte ® . International sales declined 2.4 percent on a reported basis and 0.7 percent on an organic basis, driven by challenging market dynamics in Greater China, partially offset by growth across several countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Worldwide Adult Nutrition sales increased 3.9 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter and increased 6.9 percent on an organic basis. International Adult Nutrition sales increased 7.5 percent on a reported basis and 10.4 percent on an organic basis in the third quarter. Sales performance in the quarter was led by strong growth of Ensure ® , Abbott’s market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna ® , Abbott’s market-leading diabetes-specific nutrition brand. Diagnostics ($ in millions) Worldwide Diagnostics sales increased 4.7 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 1.9 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 6.6 percent on an organic basis. Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 8.3 percent on a reported basis and 10.6 percent on an organic basis in the third quarter. Sales performance was led by above-market growth in the U.S. and internationally, where Abbott is achieving continued strong adoption of its Alinity family of innovative and highly differentiated diagnostic instruments. During the third quarter, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for its Alinity-S blood and plasma screening diagnostics instrument and several testing assays. Molecular Diagnostics sales decreased 7.8 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 1.4 percent effect of foreign exchange, and decreased 6.4 percent on an organic basis. Internationally, sales growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by lower non-governmental organization purchases in Africa. Point of Care Diagnostics sales increased 6.3 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 0.4 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 6.7 percent on an organic basis. Sales growth was led by Abbott’s market-leading i-STAT ® handheld system in the U.S. and internationally. Rapid Diagnostics sales decreased 0.7 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 1.5 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 0.8 percent on an organic basis. Organic sales growth was led by infectious disease testing in developed markets and cardio-metabolic testing globally, partially offset by lower than expected infectious disease testing sales in Africa. Established Pharmaceuticals ($ in millions) Established Pharmaceuticals sales increased 4.4 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 3.5 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 7.9 percent on an organic basis. Key Emerging Markets include India, Brazil, Russia and China along with several additional emerging countries that represent the most attractive long-term growth opportunities for Abbott’s branded generics product portfolio. Sales in these geographies increased 2.8 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter and increased 6.8 percent on an organic basis, which excludes an unfavorable 4.0 percent effect of foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was led by strong growth across several geographies, including India, China and Brazil. Other sales increased 9.2 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter, including an unfavorable 1.7 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 10.9 percent on an organic basis. Medical Devices ($ in millions) — Note: Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) sales, which had previously been reported in Electrophysiology, are now included in Rhythm Management. Historical periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Worldwide Medical Devices sales increased 8.9 percent on a reported basis in the third quarter and increased 10.6 percent on an organic basis, led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. In Electrophysiology, growth was led by strong performance in cardiac diagnostic and ablation catheters, which are used to help physicians accurately and effectively treat atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular heartbeat. In Heart Failure, strong double-digit growth was driven by market adoption of Abbott' s HeartMate 3 ® left ventricular assist device, which has been shown to improve survival and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure. Growth in Structural Heart was led by MitraClip, Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, or a leaky mitral heart valve. In the third quarter, Abbott announced U.S. FDA approval of its next-generation MitraClip device, MitraClip G4, which offers an expanded range of clip sizes, an alternative leaflet grasping feature and facilitation of procedure assessment in real time to offer doctors further options when treating mitral valve disease. In Diabetes Care, sales increased 29.6 percent on a reported basis and 33.1 percent on an organic basis in the third quarter. Sales growth in the quarter was led by FreeStyle Libre, Abbott's revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system, with worldwide sales of $496 million, an increase of 63.1 percent on a reported basis and 67.6 percent on an organic basis versus the prior year. During the third quarter, FreeStyle Libre obtained public reimbursement coverage in Ontario and Quebec, becoming the first and only sensor-based glucose monitoring system to be listed by any provincial health plan in Canada.

Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 3.6 percent on a reported basis and 9.4 percent on an organic basis in the second quarter. Sales performance in the quarter was led by above-market growth internationally, where Abbott is achieving continued strong adoption of its Alinity family of innovative and highly differentiated diagnostic instruments. In July, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for its Alinity-S (blood and plasma screening) diagnostics system and several testing assays, designed to provide faster and more efficient results within a smaller space, while maintaining the highest levels of accuracy. Molecular Diagnostics sales decreased 12.4 percent on a reported basis in the second quarter, including an unfavorable 3.1 percent effect of foreign exchange, and decreased 9.3 percent on an organic basis. As expected, sales growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by non-governmental organization (NGO) purchasing patterns in Africa. Point of Care Diagnostics sales increased 5.0 percent on a reported basis in the second quarter, including an unfavorable 0.7 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 5.7 percent on an organic basis. Sales growth was led by Abbotts market-leading i-STAT ® handheld system in the U.S. and internationally.

Key Emerging Markets include India, Brazil, Russia and China along with several additional emerging countries that represent the most attractive long-term growth opportunities for Abbotts branded generics product portfolio. Sales in these geographies decreased 1.4 percent on a reported basis in the second quarter, including an unfavorable 9.3 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 7.9 percent on an organic basis, which was led by strong growth across several countries, including India and China. Other sales decreased 3.1 percent on a reported basis in the second quarter, including an unfavorable 3.2 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 0.1 percent on an organic basis. As expected, Other sales growth was negatively impacted in the quarter by the recent discontinuation of a non-core, low-margin supply agreement. 5 Medical Devices ($ in millions) % Change vs. 2Q18 Sales 2Q19 Reported Organic U.S. Intl Total U.S. Intl Total U.S. Intl Total Total 1,360 1,715 3,075 8.0 5.1 6.4 8.0 12.4 10.5 Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation 1,202 1,271 2,473 4.7 (0.2 ) 2.1 4.7 6.5 5.6 Rhythm Management 273 275 548 (4.4 ) (3.8 ) (4.1 ) (4.4 ) 3.3 (0.6 ) Electrophysiology 190 240 430 11.4 4.9 7.6 11.4 11.4 11.4 Heart Failure 149 52 201 27.1 12.0 22.8 27.1 18.2 24.6 Vascular 270 460 730 (4.9 ) (1.3 ) (2.7 ) (4.9 ) 4.8 1.1 Structural Heart 152 200 352 29.0 1.7 11.9 29.0 9.1 16.6 Neuromodulation 168 44 212 (3.0 ) (10.4 ) (4.6 ) (3.0 ) (3.1 ) (3.0 ) Diabetes Care 158 444 602 42.1 23.9 28.2 42.1 33.1 35.3 Vascular Product Lines: Coronary and Endovascular a) 244 459 703 (2.4 ) (0.8 ) (1.3 ) (2.4 ) 5.4 2.7 a) Includes drug-eluting stents, balloon catheters, guidewires, vascular imaging/diagnostics products, vessel closure, carotid and other coronary and peripheral products. % Change vs. 1H18 Sales 1H19 Reported Organic U.S. Intl Total U.S. Intl Total U.S. Intl Total Total 2,635 3,335 5,970 6.8 5.3 5.9 6.8 12.5 10.0 Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation 2,325 2,477 4,802 2.4 0.1 1.2 2.4 6.7 4.6 Rhythm Management 525 537 1,062 (8.3 ) (4.4 ) (6.4 ) (8.3 ) 2.4 (3.0 ) Electrophysiology 364 471 835 10.2 8.8 9.4 10.2 15.1 13.0 Heart Failure 292 93 385 26.6 9.1 21.9 26.6 15.5 23.6 Vascular 536 903 1,439 (5.9 ) (1.8 ) (3.4 ) (5.9 ) 4.3 0.4 Structural Heart 288 388 676 27.0 1.7 11.2 27.0 9.2 15.8 Neuromodulation 320 85 405 (6.2 ) (8.4 ) (6.7 ) (6.2 ) (0.6 ) (5.0 ) Diabetes Care 310 858 1,168 57.1 23.8 31.2 57.1 33.1 38.4 Vascular Product Lines: Coronary and Endovascular a) 479 899 1,378 (2.5 ) (1.4 ) (1.8 ) (2.5 ) 4.6 2.1 a) Includes drug-eluting stents, balloon catheters, guidewires, vascular imaging/diagnostics products, vessel closure, carotid and other coronary and peripheral products. Note: Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) sales, which had previously been reported in Electrophysiology, are now included in Rhythm Management. Historical periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Worldwide Medical Devices sales increased 6.4 percent on a reported basis in the second quarter and increased 10.5 percent on an organic basis, led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. In Electrophysiology, growth was led by strong performance in cardiac diagnostic and ablation catheters, which are used to help physicians accurately and effectively treat atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular heartbeat. 6 In Heart Failure, growth was driven by market adoption of Abbotts HeartMate 3 ® left ventricular assist device following U.S. FDA approval as a destination (long-term use) therapy in late-2018. Growth in Structural Heart was led by MitraClip, Abbotts market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (backflow of blood through a leaky mitral heart valve). Earlier this year, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for a new, expanded indication for MitraClip to treat clinically significant secondary mitral regurgitation as a result of underlying heart failure. This new indication significantly expands the number of people that can be treated with MitraClip. Earlier this week, Abbott announced U.S. FDA approval of its next-generation MitraClip device, MitraClip G4, which offers an expanded range of clip sizes, an alternative leaflet grasping feature and facilitation of procedure assessment in real time to offer doctors further options when treating mitral valve disease. In Diabetes Care, sales increased 28.2 percent on a reported basis and 35.3 percent on an organic basis in the second quarter. Sales growth in the quarter was led by FreeStyle Libre, Abbotts revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system, with worldwide sales of $433 million, an increase of 63.9 percent on a reported basis and 72.9 percent on an organic basis versus the prior year. 7 ABBOTTS GUIDANCE FOR 2019 Abbott projects 2019 organic sales growth of 7.0 to 8.0 percent 1 , and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $2.06 to $2.12.

Specified items include intangible amortization expense, acquisition-related expenses, charges associated with cost reduction initiatives and other expenses. Excluding specified items, projected adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would be $3.21 to $3.27 for the full year 2019. Abbott is issuing third-quarter 2019 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations under GAAP of $0.53 to $0.55. Abbott forecasts specified items for the third quarter 2019 of $0.30 per share primarily related to intangible amortization, acquisition-related expenses, cost reduction initiatives and other expenses. Excluding specified items, projected adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would be $0.83 to $0.85 for the third quarter.

Furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and incorporated herein by reference, is the news release issued by Abbott announcing those results. In that news release, Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures including, among others, net earnings from continuing operations excluding specified items. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as expenses primarily associated with acquisitions and restructuring actions, charges related to cost reduction initiatives, the estimated impact of U.S. tax reform, the acquisition of an R&D asset and the cost associated with the early extinguishment of debt, charges related to impairment of certain assets, and tax benefits associated with specified items and share-based compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs, similar to how Abbotts management internally assesses performance. Abbotts management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbotts results of operations as these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbotts management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance of the businesses. Abbott, however, cautions investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Other sales decreased 3.1 percent on a reported basis in the second quarter, including an unfavorable 3.2 percent effect of foreign exchange, and increased 0.1 percent on an organic basis. As expected, Other sales growth was negatively impacted in the quarter by the recent discontinuation of a non-core, low-margin supply agreement. 5 Medical Devices ($ in millions) % Change vs. 2Q18 Sales 2Q19 Reported Organic U.S. Intl Total U.S. Intl Total U.S. Intl Total Total 1,360 1,715 3,075 8.0 5.1 6.4 8.0 12.4 10.5 Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation 1,202 1,271 2,473 4.7 (0.2 ) 2.1 4.7 6.5 5.6 Rhythm Management 273 275 548 (4.4 ) (3.8 ) (4.1 ) (4.4 ) 3.3 (0.6 ) Electrophysiology 190 240 430 11.4 4.9 7.6 11.4 11.4 11.4 Heart Failure 149 52 201 27.1 12.0 22.8 27.1 18.2 24.6 Vascular 270 460 730 (4.9 ) (1.3 ) (2.7 ) (4.9 ) 4.8 1.1 Structural Heart 152 200 352 29.0 1.7 11.9 29.0 9.1 16.6 Neuromodulation 168 44 212 (3.0 ) (10.4 ) (4.6 ) (3.0 ) (3.1 ) (3.0 ) Diabetes Care 158 444 602 42.1 23.9 28.2 42.1 33.1 35.3 Vascular Product Lines: Coronary and Endovascular a) 244 459 703 (2.4 ) (0.8 ) (1.3 ) (2.4 ) 5.4 2.7 a) Includes drug-eluting stents, balloon catheters, guidewires, vascular imaging/diagnostics products, vessel closure, carotid and other coronary and peripheral products. % Change vs. 1H18 Sales 1H19 Reported Organic U.S. Intl Total U.S. Intl Total U.S. Intl Total Total 2,635 3,335 5,970 6.8 5.3 5.9 6.8 12.5 10.0 Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation 2,325 2,477 4,802 2.4 0.1 1.2 2.4 6.7 4.6 Rhythm Management 525 537 1,062 (8.3 ) (4.4 ) (6.4 ) (8.3 ) 2.4 (3.0 ) Electrophysiology 364 471 835 10.2 8.8 9.4 10.2 15.1 13.0 Heart Failure 292 93 385 26.6 9.1 21.9 26.6 15.5 23.6 Vascular 536 903 1,439 (5.9 ) (1.8 ) (3.4 ) (5.9 ) 4.3 0.4 Structural Heart 288 388 676 27.0 1.7 11.2 27.0 9.2 15.8 Neuromodulation 320 85 405 (6.2 ) (8.4 ) (6.7 ) (6.2 ) (0.6 ) (5.0 ) Diabetes Care 310 858 1,168 57.1 23.8 31.2 57.1 33.1 38.4 Vascular Product Lines: Coronary and Endovascular a) 479 899 1,378 (2.5 ) (1.4 ) (1.8 ) (2.5 ) 4.6 2.1 a) Includes drug-eluting stents, balloon catheters, guidewires, vascular imaging/diagnostics products, vessel closure, carotid and other coronary and peripheral products. Note: Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) sales, which had previously been reported in Electrophysiology, are now included in Rhythm Management. Historical periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Worldwide Medical Devices sales increased 6.4 percent on a reported basis in the second quarter and increased 10.5 percent on an organic basis, led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. In Electrophysiology, growth was led by strong performance in cardiac diagnostic and ablation catheters, which are used to help physicians accurately and effectively treat atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular heartbeat. 6 In Heart Failure, growth was driven by market adoption of Abbotts HeartMate 3 ® left ventricular assist device following U.S. FDA approval as a destination (long-term use) therapy in late-2018. Growth in Structural Heart was led by MitraClip, Abbotts market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (backflow of blood through a leaky mitral heart valve). Earlier this year, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for a new, expanded indication for MitraClip to treat clinically significant secondary mitral regurgitation as a result of underlying heart failure. This new indication significantly expands the number of people that can be treated with MitraClip. Earlier this week, Abbott announced U.S. FDA approval of its next-generation MitraClip device, MitraClip G4, which offers an expanded range of clip sizes, an alternative leaflet grasping feature and facilitation of procedure assessment in real time to offer doctors further options when treating mitral valve disease. In Diabetes Care, sales increased 28.2 percent on a reported basis and 35.3 percent on an organic basis in the second quarter. Sales growth in the quarter was led by FreeStyle Libre, Abbotts revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system, with worldwide sales of $433 million, an increase of 63.9 percent on a reported basis and 72.9 percent on an organic basis versus the prior year. 7 ABBOTTS GUIDANCE FOR 2019 Abbott projects 2019 organic sales growth of 7.0 to 8.0 percent 1 , and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $2.06 to $2.12. Abbott forecasts net specified items for the full year 2019 of $1.15 per share. Specified items include intangible amortization expense, acquisition-related expenses, charges associated with cost reduction initiatives and other expenses. Excluding specified items, projected adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would be $3.21 to $3.27 for the full year 2019. Abbott is issuing third-quarter 2019 guidance for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations under GAAP of $0.53 to $0.55.
