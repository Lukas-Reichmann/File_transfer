Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of October 2023 related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Use of Estimates The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Supplier Financing Program Obligations In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for investors and other allocators of capital. The Company adopted this ASU as of February 1, 2023, other than the roll-forward disclosure requirement which the Company will adopt in fiscal 2025. The Company has supplier financing programs with financial institutions, in which the Company agrees to pay the financial institution the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the invoice due date for participating suppliers. Participation in these programs is optional and solely up to the supplier, who negotiates the terms of the arrangement directly with the financial institution and may allow early payment. Supplier participation in these programs has no bearing on the Company's amounts due. The payment terms that the Company has with participating suppliers under these programs generally range between 30 and 90 days. The Company does not have an economic interest in a supplier's participation in the program or a direct financial relationship with the financial institution funding the program. The Company is responsible for ensuring that participating financial institutions are paid according to the terms negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier elects to receive early payment from the financial institution. The outstanding payment obligations to financial institutions under these programs were $ 6.1 billion, $ 5.2 billion and $ 5.4 billion, as of October 31, 2023, January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively. These obligations are generally classified as accounts payable within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The activity related to these programs is classified as an operating activity within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures. 10 Table of Contents Note 2. Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share Basic net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023 and the nine months ended October 31, 2022. The calculation of diluted net loss per common share attributable to Walmart for the three months ended October 31, 2022 does not include the effect of share-based payment awards as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive and would reduce the net loss per common share, and such awards were not significant. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Numerator Consolidated net income (loss) $ 643 $ ( 1,767 ) $ 10,592 $ 5,483 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 190 ) ( 31 ) ( 575 ) ( 78 ) Consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Walmart $ 453 $ ( 1,798 ) $ 10,017 $ 5,405 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,693 2,711 2,693 2,733 Dilutive impact of share-based awards 10 — 10 10 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,703 2,711 2,703 2,743 Net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 0.17 $ ( 0.66 ) $ 3.72 $ 1.98 Diluted 0.17 ( 0.66 ) 3.71 1.97 Note 3.

Amounts for the minimum pension liability and currency translation are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program. In April 2023, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364 -day revolving credit facility of $ 10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $ 5.0 billion. In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15.0 billion at October 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the nine months ended October 31, 2023: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2023 $ 4,191 $ 34,649 $ 38,840 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt (1) — 4,967 4,967 Repayments of long-term debt ( 4,213 ) — ( 4,213 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 2,832 ( 2,832 ) — Other ( 4 ) ( 442 ) ( 446 ) Balances as of October 31, 2023 $ 2,806 $ 36,342 $ 39,148 (1) Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt are net of deferred loan costs and any related discount or premium. Debt Issuances Information on significant long-term debt issued during the nine months ended October 31, 2023, for general corporate purposes, is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Issue Date Principal Amount Maturity Date Fixed Interest Rate Net Proceeds April 18, 2023 $ 750 April 15, 2026 4.00 % $ 748 April 18, 2023 $ 750 April 15, 2028 3.90 % $ 746 April 18, 2023 $ 500 April 15, 2030 4.00 % $ 497 April 18, 2023 $ 1,500 April 15, 2033 4.10 % $ 1,491 April 18, 2023 $ 1,500 April 15, 2053 4.50 % $ 1,485 Total $ 4,967 These issuances are senior, unsecured notes which rank equally with all other senior, unsecured debt obligations of the Company, and are not convertible or exchangeable. These issuances do not contain any financial covenants and do not restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase company stock. Debt Repayments Information on significant long-term debt repayments during the nine months ended October 31, 2023 is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Maturity Date Principal Amount Fixed vs. Floating Interest Rate Repayment April 11, 2023 $ 1,750 Fixed 2.55 % $ 1,750 June 26, 2023 $ 2,280 Fixed 3.40 % $ 2,280 Total $ 4,030 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. 12 Table of Contents The Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the fair value option, on a recurring basis within other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts of gains and losses included in earnings from fair value changes for these investments are recognized within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of these investments is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of October 31, 2023 Fair Value as of January 31, 2023 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 2,889 $ 5,099 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 3,579 5,570 Total $ 6,468 $ 10,669 Changes in the fair value of these investments were primarily due to gains and losses resulting from net changes in the underlying stock prices, along with certain other immaterial investment activity. These changes in fair value included net losses of $ 4.2 billion for both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, and net losses of $ 3.6 billion and $ 4.8 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of October 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: October 31, 2023 January 31, 2023 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 6,271 $ ( 889 ) (1) $ 8,021 $ ( 689 ) (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 5,666 ( 1,352 ) (1) 5,900 ( 1,423 ) (1) Total $ 11,937 $ ( 2,241 ) $ 13,921 $ ( 2,112 ) (1) Classified primarily in deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of October 31, 2023 in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of October 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, are as follows: October 31, 2023 January 31, 2023 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 39,148 $ 35,038 $ 38,840 $ 38,169 Note 6. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. From time to time, the Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 13 Table of Contents Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid-Related Litigation During fiscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $ 3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework (described below) and other previously agreed upon state and tribal settlements. The Settlement Framework includes no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company, and the Company continues to believe it has substantial factual and legal defenses to opioids-related litigation. As of October 31, 2023, substantially all of the original approximately $ 3.3 billion accrued liability for the Settlement Framework and other settlements has been paid. In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL"") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in the MDL. On November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes whether as part of the MDL (excluding, however, a single, two-county trial described further below) or in state court, as well as all potential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes for up to approximately $ 3.1 billion (the ""Settlement Amount""). The Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of alleged harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent settlements by the Company. One settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the states and political subdivisions, and another settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to collectively as the ""Settlement Framework."" The Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political subdivisions are contingent upon the number of states and political subdivisions, including those states and political subdivisions who have not yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline. On December 20, 2022, the Company announced that it had settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories (the ""Settling States""), thus satisfying the initial threshold of required participation by Settling States. On August 22, 2023, the settlement administrator determined that a sufficient number of political subdivisions had agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework, which was a necessary condition for the Settlement Framework to become effective. The Settlement Framework became effective 15 days later, on September 6, 2023. The Company deposited the full portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States on October 11, 2023. Although the settlement administrator has determined that sufficient number of political subdivisions have agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework, and thus the Settlement Framework was effective, eligible political subdivisions still have until July 15, 2025, to join the Settlement Framework. Other Opioid-Related Litigation The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related litigation not covered or otherwise resolved by the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any other actions filed by healthcare providers, individuals, and third-party payers; and any action filed by a political subdivision or Native American tribe that is not resolved by the Settlement Framework. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a liability for these opioid-related litigation matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of any of these matters and no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Two-County Trial and MDL Bellwethers; Canada; and Other Litigation. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $ 0.7 billion over fifteen years , on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the Company filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. On September 11, 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order of certifying certain questions in the appeal for review by the Supreme Court of Ohio. The MDL designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however, these five counties have elected to participate in the Settlement Framework and receive a portion of the Settlement Amount rather than go to trial. On October 25, 2023, the MDL designated four cases brought by third-party payers as bellwether cases to proceed through discovery. Additional bellwethers of cases brought by hospitals and other healthcare providers may be designated in the future. 14 Table of Contents Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company have been named as defendants in two putative class action complaints filed in Canada related to dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. These matters remain pending. Similar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state and federal courts by state, local, and tribal governments, healthcare providers, and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these cases and in the MDL are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. Opioid-Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021, purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties had fully briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9, 2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which was filed on October 14, 2022, and which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021, alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other opioids litigation matters. On September 27, 2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the Board of Directors and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business. The defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the Company's distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay the litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors (the ""Board"") appointed an independent Special Litigation Committee (the ""SLC"") to investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former officers and directors named in the various derivative proceedings regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out its duties. The derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery is stayed until the SLC completes its investigation. Other Legal Proceedings Asda Equal Value Claims. Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, as well as additional claims in the High Court of the United Kingdom (the ""Asda Equal Value Claims""). Further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to certain of these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters. Money Transfer Agent Services Matters. The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the DOJ seeking documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. Walmart's responses to DOJ's subpoenas have been complete since 2021. The Company continues to cooperate with and provide information and documents voluntarily in response to supplemental requests from the DOJ. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the 15 Table of Contents United States Federal Trade Commission (the ""FTC"") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Walmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer agent services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 27, 2023, the Court issued an opinion dismissing the FTC's claim under the Telemarketing Sales Rule and denying Walmart's motion to dismiss the claim under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. On April 12, 2023, Walmart filed a motion to certify the Court's March 27, 2023, order for interlocutory appeal. On June 30, 2023, the FTC filed an amended complaint against Walmart again asserting claims under the Federal Trade Commission Act and Telemarketing Sales Rule. On July 20, 2023, the Court denied Walmart's motion to certify the Court's March 27, 2023, order for interlocutory appeal, finding that it would be more orderly to consider a request for interlocutory appeal after a ruling on Walmart's motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Walmart's motion to dismiss the amended complaint was filed on August 11, 2023, and remains pending. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Mexico Antitrust Matter . On October 6, 2023, the Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica of México (""COFECE"") notified the main Mexican operating subsidiary of Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. (""Walmex""), a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, that COFECE's Investigatory Authority (""IA"") had requested COFECE to initiate a quasi-judicial administrative process against Walmex's subsidiary for alleged relative monopolistic practices in connection with the supply and wholesale distribution of certain consumer goods, retail marketing practices of such consumer goods and related services. The quasi-judicial administrative process is the first opportunity for Walmex's subsidiary to respond to and defend against the IA's allegations before COFECE. While COFECE has the authority to impose monetary relief and/or non-structural conduct measures, such relief and conduct measures would be subject to appeal by Walmex's subsidiary. Walmex's subsidiary intends to defend against the allegations vigorously, both at the quasi-judicial administrative process and, if required, before any courts. Because this process is at an early stage, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters, cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise and can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Note 7. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment significantly changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 109,419 $ 104,775 $ 324,174 $ 306,809 Walmart International 28,022 25,295 82,222 73,408 Sam's Club 21,998 21,399 64,327 62,921 Net sales $ 159,439 $ 151,469 $ 470,723 $ 443,138 16 Table of Contents Operating income by segment, as well as unallocated operating expenses for corporate and support, interest, net, and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 4,981 $ 5,093 $ 16,079 $ 15,238 Walmart International 1,117 861 3,471 2,676 Sam's Club 593 562 1,572 1,449 Corporate and support ( 489 ) ( 3,821 ) ( 1,364 ) ( 4,496 ) Operating income 6,202 2,695 19,758 14,867 Interest, net 537 500 1,588 1,367 Other (gains) and losses 4,750 3,626 3,840 5,386 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 915 $ ( 1,431 ) $ 14,330 $ 8,114 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category. When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club. (Amounts in millions) Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, Walmart U.S. net sales by merchandise category 2023 2022 2023 2022 Grocery $ 66,289 $ 63,231 $ 195,936 $ 181,464 General merchandise 26,579 27,605 81,420 85,057 Health and wellness 14,173 11,947 40,395 34,172 Other categories 2,378 1,992 6,423 6,116 Total $ 109,419 $ 104,775 $ 324,174 $ 306,809 Of Walmart U.S.'s total net sales, approximately $ 16.0 billion and $ 12.9 billion related to eCommerce for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and approximately $ 46.0 billion and $ 36.9 billion related to eCommerce for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024 (""fiscal 2024"") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2023, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2023. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a relatively consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses and companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain and inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. 18 Table of Contents We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. However, like other retail companies, we have experienced continued inflation that impacts our merchandise costs. The impact to our net sales and gross profit margin is influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include, but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "" Item 5. Other Information ."" We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to pressure from inflation, a challenging macro environment, geopolitical conditions, supply chain disruptions, volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows: • Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience; • Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and • Returns - improve our Return on Investment (""ROI"") through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend. Growth Our objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We focus on comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, were as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 4.9 % 8.5 % 0.1 % 0.3 % 6.1 % 6.5 % (0.1) % 0.4 % Sam's Club 2.9 % 12.8 % (0.5) % 2.6 % 2.4 % 15.8 % (3.0) % 5.8 % Total U.S. 4.6 % 9.2 % 0.0 % 0.7 % 5.5 % 8.0 % (0.6) % 1.4 % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 4.6% and 5.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 4.9% and 6.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, driven by growth in transactions combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. The increases were partially offset by a modest decrease in general merchandise sales. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.8% and 2.7% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment increased 2.9% and 2.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket, including strong sales in 19 Table of Contents grocery and health and wellness. Comparable sales for the nine months were partially offset by lower fuel sales due to deflation in this category. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.4% and 1.6% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by Curbside Pickup and Ship to Home. Margin Our objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth with a focus on incremental margin accretion through a combination of productivity improvements as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory, and reduce costs, and we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. Additionally, we focus on our mix of businesses, including the expansion of connected value streams with higher margins, such as advertising. Our objective is to achieve operating income leverage, which we define as growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales. Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales $ 159,439 $ 151,469 $ 470,723 $ 443,138 Percentage change from comparable period 5.3 % 8.8 % 6.2 % 6.5 % Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 24.0 % 23.7 % 23.9 % 23.7 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.0 % 22.8 % 20.5 % 21.2 % Operating income $ 6,202 $ 2,695 $ 19,758 $ 14,867 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.9 % 1.8 % 4.2 % 3.4 % Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") increased 32 and 22 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to the timing of Flipkart's The Big Billion Days (""BBD"") sales event in the Walmart International segment, which shifted from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, a reduction in inflation related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment and a slight improvement in gross profit rate in the Walmart U.S. segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 182 and 70 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. The decreases were primarily driven by the lapping of opioid-related legal settlements of $3.3 billion recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased 211 and 85 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, due to the factors described above. Returns As we execute our strategic priorities, focusing on high return investments that drive operating leverage, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP"") and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.5% and 3.7% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to an increase in consolidated net income during the trailing twelve month period primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period. ROI was 14.1% and 12.8% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROI was the result of an increase in operating income primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period, partially offset by an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment. We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. 20 Table of Contents Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 16,401 $ 9,116 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 253,415 $ 246,254 Return on assets (ROA) 6.5 % 3.7 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 25,319 $ 20,754 + Interest income 504 196 + Depreciation and amortization 11,547 10,840 + Rent 2,286 2,296 = ROI operating income $ 39,656 $ 34,086 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 253,415 $ 246,254 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 112,875 103,898 ' - Average accounts payable (1) 59,156 57,210 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 26,788 25,959 = Average invested capital $ 280,346 $ 266,983 Return on investment (ROI) 14.1 % 12.8 % (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2.

The following table provides additional detail regarding our capital expenditures: (Amounts in millions) Nine Months Ended October 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2023 2022 Supply chain, customer-facing initiatives and technology $ 8,014 $ 6,304 Store and club remodels 4,740 3,965 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 48 33 Total U.S. 12,802 10,302 Walmart International 1,872 1,759 Total Capital Expenditures $ 14,674 $ 12,061 Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $3.3 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to timing of certain payments and moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges. Free cash flow for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was $4.3 billion, which represents an increase of $0.7 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash flow is due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $2.6 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 19,014 $ 15,698 Payments for property and equipment (14,674) (12,061) Free cash flow $ 4,340 $ 3,637 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (15,374) $ (12,965) Net cash used in financing activities (179) (5,581) (1) ""Net Cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Total revenues $ 160,804 $ 152,813 $ 474,737 $ 447,241 Percentage change from comparable period 5.2 % 8.7 % 6.1 % 6.5% Net sales $ 159,439 $ 151,469 $ 470,723 $ 443,138 Percentage change from comparable period 5.3 % 8.8 % 6.2 % 6.5% Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 4.6 % 9.2 % 5.5 % 8.0% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 24.0 % 23.7 % 23.9 % 23.7% Operating income $ 6,202 $ 2,695 $ 19,758 $ 14,867 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.9 % 1.8 % 4.2 % 3.4% Other (gains) and losses $ 4,750 $ 3,626 $ 3,840 $ 5,386 Consolidated net income (loss) $ 643 $ (1,767) $ 10,592 $ 5,483 Unit counts at period end 10,509 10,586 10,509 10,586 Retail square feet at period end 1,050 1,056 1,050 1,056 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales but also include membership and other income, increased $8.0 billion or 5.2% and $27.5 billion or 6.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, which were driven by growth in transactions, combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness, along with positive comparable sales in most of our international markets. Net sales were positively impacted by $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. Gross profit rate increased 32 and 22 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to the shift in timing of the BBD sales event in the Walmart International segment, a reduction in inflation related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment and a slight improvement in gross profit rate in the Walmart U.S. segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 182 and 70 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases were primarily driven by the lapping of opioid-related legal settlements of $3.3 billion recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. The net increase of $1.1 billion and net decrease of $1.5 billion in other losses for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, were primarily due to changes in the fair value of our equity and other investments driven by changes in their underlying stock prices. Our effective income tax rate was 29.7% and 26.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, compared to (23.5)% and 32.4% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase in effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year is primarily due to tax expense on a quarterly pre-tax loss during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, which included charges related to opioid-related legal settlements and net losses in fair value of our investments. The decrease in effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year was primarily due to the tax impact of charges associated with opioid-related legal settlements and net losses in fair value of our investments. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $2.4 billion and $5.1 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Additionally, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which included stronger results from our Walmex operations. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $0.17 and $3.71 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which represents respective increases of $0.83 and $1.74 when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. 23 Table of Contents Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales $ 109,419 $ 104,775 $ 324,174 $ 306,809 Percentage change from comparable period 4.4 % 8.5 % 5.7 % 6.5 % Calendar comparable sales increase 4.9 % 8.5 % 6.1 % 6.5 % Operating income $ 4,981 $ 5,093 $ 16,079 $ 15,238 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.6 % 4.9 % 5.0 % 5.0 % Unit counts at period end 4,616 4,720 4,616 4,720 Retail square feet at period end 699 702 699 702 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $4.6 billion or 4.4% and $17.4 billion or 5.7% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to comparable sales of 4.9% and 6.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, driven by growth in transactions combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. The increases were partially offset by a modest decrease in general merchandise sales. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.8% and 2.7% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. Gross profit rate was relatively flat, having increased by 5 and 3 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 35 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and was relatively flat for the nine months ended October 31, 2023, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase for the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to increases in wage related expenses, store remodel costs and legal expenses. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $0.1 billion and increased $0.8 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales $ 28,022 $ 25,295 $ 82,222 $ 73,408 Percentage change from comparable period 10.8 % 7.1 % 12.0 % (0.7) % Operating income $ 1,117 $ 861 $ 3,471 $ 2,676 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.0 % 3.4 % 4.2 % 3.6 % Unit counts at period end 5,294 5,266 5,294 5,266 Retail square feet at period end 271 274 271 274 Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $2.7 billion or 10.8% and $8.8 billion or 12.0% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to positive comparable sales in most of our international markets and positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. The increases were partially offset by the shift in timing of the BBD sales event. Gross profit rate increased 151 and 44 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by the shift in timing of the BBD sales event, partially offset by ongoing format and channel mix shifts and category mix shifts to food and consumables. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 75 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by the shift in timing of the BBD sales event, partially offset by format mix shifts in certain markets. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 53 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales, format mix shifts and operating efficiencies in most of our markets, partially offset by the timing of the BBD sales event. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.3 billion and $0.8 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Additionally, the increase in operating income for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was partially offset by the lapping of a benefit in membership and other income related to an insurance settlement for Walmart Chile in the previous year. 24 Table of Contents Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Including Fuel Net sales $ 21,998 $ 21,399 $ 64,327 $ 62,921 Percentage change from comparable period 2.8 % 12.8 % 2.2 % 15.9 % Calendar comparable sales increase 2.9 % 12.8 % 2.4 % 15.8 % Operating income $ 593 $ 562 $ 1,572 $ 1,449 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.7 % 2.6 % 2.4 % 2.3 % Unit counts at period end 599 600 599 600 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 18,900 $ 18,306 $ 55,608 $ 52,837 Percentage change from comparable period 3.2 % 10.2 % 5.2 % 10.1 % Operating income $ 412 $ 397 $ 1,158 $ 954 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.1 % 1.8 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $0.6 billion or 2.8% and $1.4 billion or 2.2% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 2.9% and 2.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Comparable sales for the nine months were partially offset by lower fuel sales due to deflation in this category. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.4% and 1.6% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by Curbside Pickup and Ship to Home. Gross profit rate increased 16 and 64 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase in gross profit rate for the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to a reduction in inflation related LIFO charges, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories and investments in price. The increase in gross profit rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to the lapping of elevated supply chain costs and a reduction in inflation related LIFO charges. Membership and other income increased 4.5% and 5.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to growth in the membership base, Plus penetration and Plus renewals. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 13 and 57 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to elevated technology spend and higher facilities costs. In addition, lower fuel sales contributed to the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales during the nine months ended October 31, 2023. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income was relatively flat and increased $0.1 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 25 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 19,014 $ 15,698 Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion as compared to $15.7 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase is primarily due to timing of certain payments and moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $12.2 billion and $11.6 billion at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our working capital deficit was $15.8 billion as of October 31, 2023, which increased when compared to the $13.7 billion working capital deficit as of October 31, 2022, primarily driven by timing of certain payments and an increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in current maturities of long-term debt. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of October 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash used in investing activities $ (15,374) $ (12,965) Net cash used in investing activities was $15.4 billion as compared to $13.0 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of $2.4 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 is primarily the result of an increase in payments for property and equipment. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash used in financing activities $ (179) $ (5,581) Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $0.2 billion as compared to $5.6 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to fewer repurchases of Company stock and an increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by the purchase of certain noncontrolling interests and payments of long-term debt. In April 2023, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at October 31, 2023, all undrawn. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the nine months ended October 31, 2023: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2023 $ 4,191 $ 34,649 $ 38,840 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 4,967 4,967 Repayments of long-term debt (4,213) — (4,213) Reclassifications of long-term debt 2,832 (2,832) — Other (4) (442) (446) Balances as of October 31, 2023 $ 2,806 $ 36,342 $ 39,148 During the nine months ended October 31, 2023, our total outstanding long-term debt increased $0.3 billion primarily due to the issuance of new long-term debt in April 2023, partially offset by the maturities of certain long-term debt. Refer to Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the issuances and repayments of long-term debt. 26 Table of Contents Dividends Effective February 21, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2024 annual dividend of $2.28 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share. For fiscal 2024, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.57 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 17, 2023 April 3, 2023 May 5, 2023 May 30, 2023 August 11, 2023 September 5, 2023 December 8, 2023 January 2, 2024 The dividend installments payable on April 3, 2023, May 30, 2023 and September 5, 2023 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the nine months ended October 31, 2023 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of October 31, 2023, authorization for $18.1 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022: Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 Total number of shares repurchased 8.7 65.5 Average price paid per share $ 148.19 $ 132.86 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 1,282 $ 8,708 Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Stock During the nine months ended October 31, 2023, the Company paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and settle the liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe. Additionally, during the nine months ended October 31, 2023, the Company received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of equity funding for the Company's majority-owned PhonePe subsidiary. Material Cash Requirements Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. Capital Resources We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of October 31, 2023, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA 27 Table of Contents Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. As of October 31, 2023, there were no material changes to our market risks disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 17, 2023, under the caption ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 28 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we began implementing a new financial system, including our general ledger, in stages beginning in our U.S. and Canadian markets. This financial system is a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to implement other components of our new financial system in stages, and each implementation will impact our internal control over financial reporting. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no significant change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 29 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters, including responding to subpoenas and requests for information in connection with government investigations. We discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption ""Item 1. Financial Statements,"" in Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings."" We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 400 cases as of November 15, 2023. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion over fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The Company has filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive portion of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. On September 11, 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order certifying certain questions in the appeal for review by the Supreme Court of Ohio. The MDL designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery, though those bellwether plaintiffs have elected to participate in the Settlement Framework. On October 25, 2023, the MDL designated four cases brought by third-party payers as bellwether cases to proceed through discovery. Additional bellwethers of cases brought by hospitals and other healthcare providers may be designated in the future. In addition, there are over 100 other cases pending in state and federal courts throughout the country against the Company as of November 15, 2023, as well as other cases in Canada against Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable, are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Opioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a Settlement Framework to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as described above), as described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company now has settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits brought by state and local governments against the Company. As described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Settlement Framework became effective on September 6, 2023. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al ., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed the Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion remains pending. Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the Company' s distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay the litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors appointed an independent Special Litigation Committee (the ""SLC"") to investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former officers and directors named in the various proceedings regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized 30 Table of Contents the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out its duties. The derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery is stayed until the SLC completes its investigation. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, purport to be filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016, through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v.

(Docket IO-002-2020, consolidated with Docket DE-026-2020), Mexico, 10/6/23. 31 Table of Contents II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (""Flipkart""), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the ""Rules"") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold of $1 million. In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc., and a trial date has been scheduled for April 22, 2024. The Company believes it has strong defenses and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2023, the Company received a Finding of Violation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the ""EPA"") alleging violations of the Clean Air Act in connection with the Company's refrigeration leak detection and repair program at certain of its facilities. The Company is evaluating the findings and cooperating with the EPA in its investigation. The EPA may seek to impose monetary and non-monetary penalties for the alleged violations of the Clean Air Act. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this matter. Although the Company does not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 32 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption ""Risk Factors,"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended October 31, 2023 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of October 31, 2023, authorization for $18.1 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended October 31, 2023, was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) August 1 - 31, 2023 605,199 $ 159.74 605,199 $ 18.1 September 1 - 30, 2023 — — — 18.1 October 1 - 31, 2023 — — — 18.1 Total 605,199 605,199 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month. Item 5. Other Information Security Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers None of the Company's directors or executive officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company's fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2023, as such terms are defined under Item 408(a) or Regulation S-K.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of July 2023 related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Use of Estimates The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Supplier Financing Program Obligations In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for investors and other allocators of capital. The Company adopted this ASU as of February 1, 2023, other than the roll-forward disclosure requirement which the Company will adopt in fiscal 2025. The Company has supplier financing programs with financial institutions, in which the Company agrees to pay the financial institution the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the invoice due date for participating suppliers. Participation in these programs is optional and solely up to the supplier, who negotiates the terms of the arrangement directly with the financial institution and may allow early payment. Supplier participation in these programs has no bearing on the Company's amounts due. The payment terms that the Company has with participating suppliers under these programs generally range between 30 and 90 days. The Company does not have an economic interest in a supplier's participation in the program or a direct financial relationship with the financial institution funding the program. The Company is responsible for ensuring that participating financial institutions are paid according to the terms negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier elects to receive early payment from the financial institution. The outstanding payment obligations to financial institutions under these programs were $ 5.3 billion, $ 5.2 billion and $ 6.4 billion, as of July 31, 2023, January 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022, respectively. These obligations are generally classified as accounts payable within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The activity related to these programs is classified as an operating activity within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 8 Table of Contents Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 8,053 $ 5,147 $ 9,949 $ 7,250 Consolidated net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 162 ) 2 ( 385 ) ( 47 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 7,891 $ 5,149 $ 9,564 $ 7,203 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,693 2,736 2,694 2,745 Dilutive impact of share-based awards 10 9 9 10 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,703 2,745 2,703 2,755 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 2.93 $ 1.88 $ 3.55 $ 2.62 Diluted 2.92 1.88 3.54 2.61 Note 3.

Amounts for the minimum pension liability and currency translation are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 9 Table of Contents Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program. In April 2023, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364 -day revolving credit facility of $ 10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $ 5.0 billion. In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15.0 billion at July 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the six months ended July 31, 2023: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2023 $ 4,191 $ 34,649 $ 38,840 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt (1) — 4,967 4,967 Repayments of long-term debt ( 4,063 ) — ( 4,063 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 2,773 ( 2,773 ) — Other ( 4 ) ( 37 ) ( 41 ) Balances as of July 31, 2023 $ 2,897 $ 36,806 $ 39,703 (1) Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt are net of deferred loan costs and any related discount or premium. Debt Issuances Information on significant long-term debt issued during the six months ended July 31, 2023, for general corporate purposes, is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Issue Date Principal Amount Maturity Date Fixed Interest Rate Net Proceeds April 18, 2023 $ 750 April 15, 2026 4.00 % $ 748 April 18, 2023 $ 750 April 15, 2028 3.90 % $ 746 April 18, 2023 $ 500 April 15, 2030 4.00 % $ 497 April 18, 2023 $ 1,500 April 15, 2033 4.10 % $ 1,491 April 18, 2023 $ 1,500 April 15, 2053 4.50 % $ 1,485 Total $ 4,967 These issuances are senior, unsecured notes which rank equally with all other senior, unsecured debt obligations of the Company, and are not convertible or exchangeable. These issuances do not contain any financial covenants and do not restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase company stock. Debt Repayments Information on significant long-term debt repayments during the six months ended July 31, 2023 is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Maturity Date Principal Amount Fixed vs. Floating Interest Rate Repayment April 11, 2023 $ 1,750 Fixed 2.55 % $ 1,750 June 26, 2023 $ 2,280 Fixed 3.40 % $ 2,280 Total $ 4,030 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. 10 Table of Contents The Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain equity method investments, on a recurring basis within other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of these investments is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of July 31, 2023 Fair Value as of January 31, 2023 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 4,424 $ 5,099 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 6,281 5,570 Total $ 10,705 $ 10,669 Changes in fair value of equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the fair value option measured on a recurring basis, are recognized within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value changes, along with certain other immaterial investment activity, resulted in net gains of $ 3.2 billion and $ 36 million for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, and a net gain of $ 0.8 billion and a net loss of $ 1.2 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively. These fair value changes were primarily due to net changes in the underlying stock prices of those investments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of July 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: July 31, 2023 January 31, 2023 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 6,271 $ ( 765 ) (1) $ 8,021 $ ( 689 ) (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 6,019 ( 1,295 ) (1) 5,900 ( 1,423 ) (1) Total $ 12,290 $ ( 2,060 ) $ 13,921 $ ( 2,112 ) (1) Classified primarily in deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of July 31, 2023 in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of July 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, are as follows: July 31, 2023 January 31, 2023 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 39,703 $ 37,988 $ 38,840 $ 38,169 Note 6. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. From time to time, the Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 11 Table of Contents Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid-Related Litigation During fiscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $ 3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework (described below) and other previously agreed upon state and tribal settlements. The Settlement Framework includes no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company, and the Company continues to believe it has substantial factual and legal defenses to opioids-related litigation. In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL"") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in the MDL. Similar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state courts by state, local, and tribal governments, healthcare providers, and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these state court cases and in the MDL are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. On November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes whether as part of the MDL (excluding, however, a single, two-county trial described further below) or in state court, as well as all potential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes for up to approximately $ 3.1 billion (the ""Settlement Amount""). The Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of alleged harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent settlements by the Company. One settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the states and political subdivisions, and another settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to collectively as the ""Settlement Framework."" The Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political subdivisions are contingent upon the number of states and political subdivisions, including those states and political subdivisions who have not yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline. On December 20, 2022, the Company announced that it had settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories (the ""Settling States""), thus satisfying the initial threshold of required participation by Settling States. On August 22, 2023, the settlement administrator determined that a sufficient number of political subdivisions had agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework, which was a necessary condition for the Settlement Framework to become effective. The Settlement Framework will become effective 15 days later, on September 6, 2023. The Company is required to deposit up to the full portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States within 15 days following the effective date of the Settlement Framework, which the Company expects to pay during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2023. Although the settlement administrator has determined a sufficient number of political subdivisions have agreed to participate in the State Settlement Framework, and thus the State Settlement Framework will become effective, eligible political subdivisions still have until July 15, 2025 to join the State Settlement Framework. Through July 2023, the Company has paid approximately $ 0.6 billion in the aggregate for separate settlements with Cherokee Nation, New Mexico, Florida, West Virginia, and Alabama, as well as various Native American tribes (excluding Cherokee Nation) that agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline. Of the original approximately $ 3.3 billion accrued liability for the Settlement Framework and other settlements, approximately $ 2.8 billion remains and is recorded in accrued liabilities within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 31, 2023. Other Opioid-Related Litigation The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related litigation not covered or otherwise resolved by the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any other actions filed by healthcare providers, individuals, and third-party payers; and any action filed by a political subdivision or Native American tribe that is not resolved by the Settlement Framework. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a liability for these opioid-related litigation matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of any of these matters and no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Two-County Trial and MDL Bellwethers; and Canada. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including 12 Table of Contents the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $ 0.7 billion over fifteen years , on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the Company filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. The MDL designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however, these five counties have elected to participate in the Settlement Framework and receive a portion of the Settlement Amount rather than go to trial. The MDL may designate additional bellwethers of cases brought by healthcare providers and third-party payers. Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company have been named as defendants in two putative class action complaints filed in Canada related to dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. These matters remain pending. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. Opioid-Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021, purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties had fully briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9, 2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which was filed on October 14, 2022, and which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017 through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021, alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other opioids litigation matters. On September 27, 2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the current Board of Directors and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business. The defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the Company's distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay the litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors (the ""Board"") appointed an independent Special Litigation Committee (the ""SLC"") to investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former officers and directors named in the various derivative proceedings regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out its duties. The derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery is stayed until the SLC completes its investigation. Other Legal Proceedings Asda Equal Value Claims. Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, as well as additional claims in the High Court of the United Kingdom (the ""Asda Equal Value Claims""). Further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to certain of these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters. Money Transfer Agent Services Matters. The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the DOJ seeking documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, 13 Table of Contents where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company continues to cooperate with and provide information in response to requests from the DOJ. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the ""FTC"") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Walmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer agent services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 5, 2022, the FTC responded to the motion, and on October 28, 2022, the Company filed its reply. On March 27, 2023, the Court issued an opinion dismissing the FTC's claim under the Telemarketing Sales Rule and denying Walmart's motion to dismiss the claim under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. On April 12, 2023, Walmart filed a motion to certify the Court's March 27, 2023, order for interlocutory appeal. The FTC's response to Walmart's motion to certify an interlocutory appeal was filed on May 8, 2023; Walmart filed its reply on May 18, 2023. On June 30, 2023, the FTC filed an amended complaint against Walmart again asserting claims under the Federal Trade Commission Act and Telemarketing Sales Rule. Walmart's motion to dismiss the amended complaint was filed on August 11, 2023; the FTC's response is due on September 15, 2023; and Walmart's reply is due on October 9, 2023. On July 20, 2023, the Court denied Walmart's motion to certify the Court's March 27, 2023, order for interlocutory appeal, finding that it would be more orderly to consider a request for interlocutory appeal after a ruling on Walmart's motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Note 7. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment significantly changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 110,854 $ 105,130 $ 214,755 $ 202,034 Walmart International 27,596 24,350 54,200 48,113 Sam's Club 21,830 21,901 42,329 41,522 Net sales $ 160,280 $ 151,381 $ 311,284 $ 291,669 14 Table of Contents Operating income by segment, as well as unallocated operating expenses for corporate and support, interest, net, and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 6,114 $ 5,683 $ 11,098 $ 10,145 Walmart International 1,190 1,043 2,354 1,815 Sam's Club 521 427 979 887 Corporate and support ( 509 ) ( 299 ) ( 875 ) ( 675 ) Operating income 7,316 6,854 13,556 12,172 Interest, net 494 448 1,051 867 Other (gains) and losses ( 3,905 ) ( 238 ) ( 910 ) 1,760 Income before income taxes $ 10,727 $ 6,644 $ 13,415 $ 9,545 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category. When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024 (""fiscal 2024"") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2023, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2023. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a relatively consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses and companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain and inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. 16 Table of Contents We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. However, like other retail companies, we have experienced continued inflation that impacts our merchandise costs. The impact to our net sales and gross profit margin is influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include, but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "" Item 5. Other Information ."" We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to pressure from inflation, a challenging macro environment, geopolitical conditions, supply chain disruptions, volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows: • Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience; • Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and • Returns - improve our Return on Investment (""ROI"") through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend. Growth Our objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We focus on comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, were as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 5.9 % 7.0 % (0.3) % 0.6 % 6.7 % 5.5 % (0.3) % 0.5 % Sam's Club (0.2) % 17.3 % (5.6) % 8.0 % 2.1 % 17.4 % (4.4) % 7.5 % Total U.S. 4.9 % 8.7 % (1.2) % 1.9 % 5.9 % 7.4 % (1.0) % 1.7 % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 4.9% and 5.9% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 5.9% and 6.7% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness, as well as elevated inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, combined with growth in transactions. The increases were partially offset by a modest decrease in general merchandise sales. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.5% and 2.6% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. 17 Table of Contents Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment decreased 0.2% and increased 2.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in comparable sales for the three months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to lower fuel sales from deflation in this category, offset by growth in merchandise sales, which benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included elevated inflation impacts on certain merchandise categories. Growth in comparable sales for the six months ended July 31, 2023 benefited from growth in average ticket and transactions and included elevated inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, partially offset by lower fuel sales due to deflation in this category. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.8% and 1.7% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by Curbside Pickup and Ship to Home. Margin Our objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth with a focus on incremental margin accretion through a combination of productivity improvements as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory, and reduce costs, and we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. Additionally, we focus on our mix of businesses, including the expansion of connected value streams with higher margins, such as advertising. Our objective is to achieve operating income leverage, which we define as growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales. Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales $ 160,280 $ 151,381 $ 311,284 $ 291,669 Percentage change from comparable period 5.9 % 8.2 % 6.7 % 5.3 % Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 24.0 % 23.5 % 23.8 % 23.7 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 20.3 % 19.9 % 20.3 % 20.4 % Operating income $ 7,316 $ 6,854 $ 13,556 $ 12,172 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.6 % 4.5 % 4.4 % 4.2 % Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") increased 50 and 17 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to the lapping of higher markdowns and supply chain costs incurred in the previous year and managing prices to reflect elevated cost inflation, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories globally. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 33 and decreased 10 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively. The increase for the three months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher variable pay, technology and remodel costs in the U.S. and an incremental expense related to the opioid settlement, partially offset by strong fixed cost leverage in most of our international markets. The decrease for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was driven by higher sales in each of our segments as well as operating discipline. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased 3 and 18 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, due to the factors described above. Returns As we execute our strategic priorities, focusing on high return investments that drive operating leverage, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP"") and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.6% and 5.8% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the increase in average total assets driven by higher purchases of property and equipment. ROI was 12.8% and 13.8% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROI was the result of a decrease in operating income primarily due to opioid legal charges and reorganization and restructuring charges recorded in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2023 respectively, as well as an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. 18 Table of Contents Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 13,991 $ 14,015 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 251,160 $ 242,876 Return on assets (ROA) 5.6 % 5.8 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 21,812 $ 23,851 + Interest income 442 155 + Depreciation and amortization 11,318 10,733 + Rent 2,284 2,302 = ROI operating income $ 35,856 $ 37,041 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 251,160 $ 242,876 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 110,921 102,155 ' - Average accounts payable (1) 55,384 51,896 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 26,541 23,878 = Average invested capital $ 280,156 $ 269,257 Return on investment (ROI) 12.8 % 13.8 % (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2.

The following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Six Months Ended July 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2023 2022 Supply chain, customer-facing initiatives and technology $ 5,180 $ 4,106 Store and club remodels 2,974 2,377 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 17 21 Total U.S. 8,171 6,504 Walmart International 1,045 988 Total Capital Expenditures $ 9,216 $ 7,492 Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $18.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $9.0 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases and timing of certain payments. Free cash flow for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was $9.0 billion, which represents an increase of $7.2 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash flow is due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $1.7 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 18,201 $ 9,240 Payments for property and equipment (9,216) (7,492) Free cash flow $ 8,985 $ 1,748 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (9,909) $ (8,584) Net cash used in financing activities (3,309) (1,400) (1) ""Net Cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Total revenues $ 161,632 $ 152,859 $ 313,933 $ 294,428 Percentage change from comparable period 5.7 % 8.4 % 6.6 % 5.4% Net sales $ 160,280 $ 151,381 $ 311,284 $ 291,669 Percentage change from comparable period 5.9 % 8.2 % 6.7 % 5.3% Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 4.9 % 8.7 % 5.9 % 7.4% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 24.0 % 23.5 % 23.8 % 23.7% Operating income $ 7,316 $ 6,854 $ 13,556 $ 12,172 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.6 % 4.5 % 4.4 % 4.2% Other (gains) and losses $ (3,905) $ (238) $ (910) $ 1,760 Consolidated net income $ 8,053 $ 5,147 $ 9,949 $ 7,250 Unit counts at period end 10,482 10,585 10,482 10,585 Retail square feet at period end 1,050 1,057 1,050 1,057 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales but also include membership and other income, increased $8.8 billion or 5.7% and $19.5 billion or 6.6% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase in revenue for the three months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. segment, which were driven by growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness, as well as elevated inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, combined with growth in transactions. Additionally, most of our international markets had positive comparable sales. Net sales were positively impacted by $0.6 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and negatively impacted by a decrease in fuel sales of $1.0 billion in the Sam's Club segment primarily due to deflation in this category. The increase in revenue for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, which were driven by growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness, as well as elevated inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, combined with growth in transactions. Additionally, most of our international markets had positive comparable sales. Net sales were positively impacted by $0.3 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and negatively impacted by a decrease in fuel sales of $1.4 billion in the Sam's Club segment primarily due to deflation in this category. Gross profit rate increased 50 and 17 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to the lapping of higher markdowns and supply chain costs incurred in the previous year and managing prices to reflect elevated cost inflation, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories globally. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 33 and decreased 10 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase for the three months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher variable pay, technology and remodel costs in the U.S. and an incremental expense related to the opioid settlement, partially offset by strong fixed cost leverage in most of our international markets. The decrease for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was driven by higher sales in each of our segments as well as operating discipline. Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. The net increases of $3.7 billion and $2.7 billion in other gains for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, were primarily due to increases in net gains from changes in the fair value of our equity and other investments driven by net increases in their underlying stock prices. Our effective income tax rate was 24.9% and 25.8% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, compared to 22.5% and 24.0% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a fiscal 2023 non-recurring rate benefit from the gain recognized on the sale of our remaining equity method investment in Brazil, which provided minimal realizable tax expense, and a discrete benefit for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, partially offset by the tax impact on changes in fair value of our investments. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. 21 Table of Contents As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Additionally, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, which included stronger results from our Walmex operations. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $2.92 and $3.54 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, which represents respective increases of $1.04 and $0.93 when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales $ 110,854 $ 105,130 $ 214,755 $ 202,034 Percentage change from comparable period 5.4 % 7.1 % 6.3 % 5.6 % Calendar comparable sales increase 5.9 % 7.0 % 6.7 % 5.5 % Operating income $ 6,114 $ 5,683 $ 11,098 $ 10,145 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.5 % 5.4 % 5.2 % 5.0 % Unit counts at period end 4,616 4,735 4,616 4,735 Retail square feet at period end 699 702 699 702 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $5.7 billion or 5.4% and $12.7 billion or 6.3% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to comparable sales of 5.9% and 6.7% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness, as well as elevated inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, combined with growth in transactions. The increases were partially offset by a modest decrease in general merchandise sales. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.5% and 2.6% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. Gross profit rate increased 40 and 2 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily driven by the lapping of higher markdowns and supply chain costs incurred in the previous year and managing prices to reflect elevated cost inflation, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 28 basis points and decreased 16 basis points for three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase for the three months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher variable pay, elevated technology spend and higher costs related to store remodels. The decrease for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to strong sales growth, partially offset by higher variable pay. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.4 billion and $1.0 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net sales $ 27,596 $ 24,350 $ 54,200 $ 48,113 Percentage change from comparable period 13.3 % 5.7 % 12.7 % (4.4) % Operating income $ 1,190 $ 1,043 $ 2,354 $ 1,815 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.3 % 4.3 % 4.3 % 3.8 % Unit counts at period end 5,267 5,250 5,267 5,250 Retail square feet at period end 271 274 271 274 Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $3.2 billion or 13.3% and $6.1 billion or 12.7% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to positive comparable sales in most of our international markets, including eCommerce growth, and positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $0.6 billion and $0.3 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively. Gross profit rate decreased 37 and 12 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to ongoing format and channel mix shifts and category mix shifts to food and consumables. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 129 and 120 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales, format mix shifts and operating efficiencies in most of our markets. 22 Table of Contents As a result of the factors discussed above, as well as lapping a benefit in membership and other income related to an insurance settlement for Walmart Chile, operating income increased $0.1 billion and $0.5 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Including Fuel Net sales $ 21,830 $ 21,901 $ 42,329 $ 41,522 Percentage change from comparable period (0.3) % 17.5 % 1.9 % 17.5 % Calendar comparable sales increase (0.2) % 17.3 % 2.1 % 17.4 % Operating income $ 521 $ 427 $ 979 $ 887 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.4 % 1.9 % 2.3 % 2.1 % Unit counts at period end 599 600 599 600 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 18,945 $ 17,999 $ 36,708 $ 34,531 Percentage change from comparable period 5.3 % 9.5 % 6.3 % 10.1 % Operating income $ 392 $ 222 $ 746 $ 557 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.1 % 1.2 % 2.0 % 1.6 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment decreased $0.1 billion or 0.3% and increased $0.8 billion or 1.9% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decrease for the three months ended July 31, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in fuel sales of $1.0 billion due to deflation in this category. Net sales excluding fuel increased $0.9 billion primarily due to increased merchandise sales, which benefited from growth in average transactions and ticket and included elevated inflation impacts on certain merchandise categories. The increase for the six months ended July 31, 2023 was driven by an increase in comparable sales, including fuel, of 2.1%. Growth in comparable sales for the six months ended July 31, 2023 benefited from growth in average ticket and transactions and included elevated inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, partially offset by lower fuel sales due to deflation in this category. Net sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in fuel sales of $1.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.8% and 1.7% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by Curbside Pickup and Ship to Home. Gross profit rate increased 135 and 88 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases in gross profit rate were primarily due to the lapping of higher supply chain costs and inventory write-downs in the previous year. The three months ended July 31, 2023 also increased due to the lapping of a larger inflation related LIFO charge recorded in the previous year. Membership and other income increased 6.9% and 5.8% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to growth in our membership base, Plus penetration and renewals. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 107 and 79 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by lower fuel sales, elevated technology spend and higher facilities costs. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.1 billion for both the three and six months ended July 31, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 23 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 18,201 $ 9,240 Net cash provided by operating activities was $18.2 billion as compared to $9.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases and timing of certain payments. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents was $13.9 billion at both July 31, 2023 and 2022. Our working capital deficit was $17.2 billion as of July 31, 2023, which increased when compared to the $15.7 billion working capital deficit as of July 31, 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in inventories, as described above and an increase in accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of July 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents of $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash used in investing activities $ (9,909) $ (8,584) Net cash used in investing activities was $9.9 billion as compared to $8.6 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of $1.3 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023 is primarily the result of an increase in payments for property and equipment. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash used in financing activities $ (3,309) $ (1,400) Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $3.3 billion as compared to $1.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to decreases in short-term borrowings, the purchase of certain noncontrolling interests and payments of long-term debt, partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2024 and fewer repurchases of Company stock. In April 2023, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at July 31, 2023, all undrawn. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the six months ended July 31, 2023: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2023 $ 4,191 $ 34,649 $ 38,840 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 4,967 4,967 Repayments of long-term debt (4,063) — (4,063) Reclassifications of long-term debt 2,773 (2,773) — Other (4) (37) (41) Balances as of July 31, 2023 $ 2,897 $ 36,806 $ 39,703 During the six months ended July 31, 2023, our total outstanding long-term debt increased $0.9 billion primarily due to the issuance of new long-term debt in April 2023, partially offset by the maturities of certain long-term debt. Refer to Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the issuances and repayments of long-term debt. 24 Table of Contents Dividends Effective February 21, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2024 annual dividend of $2.28 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share. For fiscal 2024, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.57 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 17, 2023 April 3, 2023 May 5, 2023 May 30, 2023 August 11, 2023 September 5, 2023 December 8, 2023 January 2, 2024 The dividend installments payable on April 3, 2023 and May 30, 2023 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the six months ended July 31, 2023 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of July 31, 2023, authorization for $18.2 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the six months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022: Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 Total number of shares repurchased 8.0 43.3 Average price paid per share $ 147.18 $ 132.74 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 1,171 $ 5,747 Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Stock During the six months ended July 31, 2023, the Company paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and settle the liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe. Additionally, during the six months ended July 31, 2023, the Company received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of equity funding for the Company's majority-owned PhonePe subsidiary. Material Cash Requirements Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include opioid and other legal settlements, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. Capital Resources We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of July 31, 2023, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA 25 Table of Contents Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. Other Matters In Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies"" and appears in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "" Item 1. Financial Statements ,"" we discuss, under the sub-captions "" Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid-Related Litigation, "" and "" Other Opioid-Related Litigation, "" the Prescription Opiate Litigation, the Settlement Framework, and other matters, including certain risks arising therefrom.

Environmental Matters."" The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. As of July 31, 2023, there were no material changes to our market risks disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 17, 2023, under the caption ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 26 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we began implementing a new financial system, including our general ledger, in stages beginning in our U.S. and Canadian markets. This financial system is a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to implement other components of our new financial system in stages, and each implementation will impact our internal control over financial reporting. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no significant change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 27 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters, including responding to subpoenas and requests for information in connection with government investigations. We discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption ""Item 1. Financial Statements,"" in Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings."" We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of August 18, 2023. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion over fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The Company has filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive portion of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. The MDL designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery, though those bellwether plaintiffs have elected to participate in the Settlement Framework. The MDL may designate additional bellwethers of cases brought by healthcare providers and third-party payers. In addition, there are approximately 140 other cases pending in state and federal courts throughout the country as of August 18, 2023, as well as other cases in Canada against Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable, are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Opioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a Settlement Framework to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as described above), as described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company now has settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits brought by state and local governments against the Company. As described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Settlement Framework will become effective on September 6, 2023. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al ., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed the Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion remains pending. Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the Company' s distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay the litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors appointed an independent Special Litigation Committee (the ""SLC"") to investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former officers and directors named in the various proceedings regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out its duties. The derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery is stayed until the SLC completes its investigation. 28 Table of Contents The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, purport to be filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v. McMillon et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 4/16/21: Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund et al. v. Walton et al., DE Court of Chancery, 9/27/21. Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and Martin v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC , Dist. of DE, 3/5/21, consolidated into In re Walmart Inc. Securities Litigation , USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21. ASDA Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v. ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others – Manchester Employment Tribunal); Abbas & Others v Asda Stores limited (KB-2022-003243) ; and Abusubih & Others v Asda Stores limited (KB-2022-003240). Money Transfer Agent Services Litigation: Federal Trade Commission v. Walmart Inc. (CV-3372), USDC, N. Dist. Of Ill, 6/28/22. 29 Table of Contents II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (""Flipkart""), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the ""Rules"") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million. In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc., and a trial date has been scheduled for April 22, 2024. The Company believes the suit is without merit and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption ""Risk Factors,"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended July 31, 2023 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of July 31, 2023, authorization for $18.2 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended July 31, 2023, was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) May 1 - 31, 2023 1,228,888 $ 149.93 1,228,888 $ 18.5 June 1 - 30, 2023 1,017,996 153.38 1,017,996 18.3 July 1 - 31, 2023 910,249 156.80 910,249 18.2 Total 3,157,133 3,157,133 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month. Item 5. Other Information Security Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers None of the Company's directors or executive officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the Company's fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2023, as such terms are defined under Item 408(a) or Regulation S-K.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of April 2023 related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Use of Estimates The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Supplier Financing Program Obligations In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for investors and other allocators of capital. The Company adopted this ASU as of February 1, 2023, other than the roll-forward disclosure requirement which the Company will adopt in fiscal 2025. The Company has supplier financing programs with financial institutions, in which the Company agrees to pay the financial institution the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the invoice due date for participating suppliers. Participation in these programs is optional and solely up to the supplier, who negotiate the terms of the arrangement directly with the financial institution and may allow early payment. Supplier participation in these programs has no bearing on the Company's amounts due. The payment terms that the Company has with participating suppliers under these programs generally range between 30 and 90 days. The Company does not have an economic interest in a supplier's participation in the program or a direct financial relationship with the financial institution funding the program. The Company is responsible for ensuring that participating financial institutions are paid according to the terms negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier elects to receive early payment from the financial institution. The outstanding payment obligations to financial institutions under these programs were $ 4.7 billion, $ 5.2 billion and $ 6.0 billion, as of April 30, 2023, January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. These obligations are primarily recorded within the accounts payable account within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The activity related to these programs is reflected within the operating activities section of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 8 Table of Contents Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three months ended April 30, 2023 and 2022. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 1,896 $ 2,103 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 223 ) ( 49 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 1,673 $ 2,054 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,694 2,754 Dilutive impact of share-based awards 10 11 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,704 2,765 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 0.62 $ 0.75 Diluted 0.62 0.74 Note 3.

Amounts for the minimum pension liability are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 9 Table of Contents Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program. In April 2023, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364 -day revolving credit facility of $ 10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $ 5.0 billion. In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15.0 billion at April 30, 2023 and January 31, 2023, all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the three months ended April 30, 2023: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2023 $ 4,191 $ 34,649 $ 38,840 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt (1) — 4,967 4,967 Repayments of long-term debt ( 1,784 ) — ( 1,784 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 1,572 ( 1,572 ) — Other ( 4 ) 76 72 Balances as of April 30, 2023 $ 3,975 $ 38,120 $ 42,095 (1) Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt are net of deferred loan costs and any related discount or premium. Debt Issuances Information on significant long-term debt issued during the three months ended April 30, 2023, for general corporate purposes, is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Issue Date Principal Amount Maturity Date Fixed Interest Rate Net Proceeds April 18, 2023 $ 750 April 15, 2026 4.000 % $ 748 April 18, 2023 $ 750 April 15, 2028 3.900 % $ 746 April 18, 2023 $ 500 April 15, 2030 4.000 % $ 497 April 18, 2023 $ 1,500 April 15, 2033 4.100 % $ 1,491 April 18, 2023 $ 1,500 April 15, 2053 4.500 % $ 1,485 Total $ 4,967 These issuances are senior, unsecured notes which rank equally with all other senior, unsecured debt obligations of the Company, and are not convertible or exchangeable. These issuances do not contain any financial covenants and do not restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase company stock. Debt Repayments Information on significant long-term debt repayments during the three months ended April 30, 2023 is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Maturity Date Principal Amount Fixed vs. Floating Interest Rate Repayment April 11, 2023 $ 1,750 Fixed 2.55 % $ 1,750 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. 10 Table of Contents The Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain equity method investments, on a recurring basis within other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of these investments is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of April 30, 2023 Fair Value as of January 31, 2023 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 3,433 $ 5,099 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 4,082 5,570 Total $ 7,515 $ 10,669 Changes in fair value of equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the fair value option measured on a recurring basis, are recognized within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. These fair value changes, along with certain other immaterial investment activity, resulted in net losses of $ 3.2 billion and $ 2.0 billion for three months ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily due to net changes in the underlying stock prices of those investments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of April 30, 2023 and January 31, 2023, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: April 30, 2023 January 31, 2023 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 6,271 $ ( 669 ) (1) $ 8,021 $ ( 689 ) (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 5,920 ( 1,522 ) (1) 5,900 ( 1,423 ) (1) Total $ 12,191 $ ( 2,191 ) $ 13,921 $ ( 2,112 ) (1) Classified primarily in deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of April 30, 2023 in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of April 30, 2023 and January 31, 2023, are as follows: April 30, 2023 January 31, 2023 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 42,095 $ 41,296 $ 38,840 $ 38,169 Note 6. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. From time to time, the Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 11 Table of Contents Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid Related Litigation During fiscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $ 3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework (described below) and other previously agreed upon state and tribal settlements. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. Moreover, the Settlement Framework will only take effect once a sufficient number of political subdivisions join, and there is no assurance regarding such participation. The amount of ultimate loss may thus differ materially from this accrual. The Settlement Framework includes no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company, and the Company continues to believe it has substantial factual and legal defenses to opioids-related litigation. In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL"") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in the MDL. Similar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state courts by state, local, and tribal governments, healthcare providers, and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these state court cases and in the MDL are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. On November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes whether as part of the MDL (excluding, however, a single, two-county trial described further below) or pending state court, as well as all potential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes for up to approximately $ 3.1 billion (the ""Settlement Amount""). The Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of alleged harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent settlements by the Company. One settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the states and political subdivisions, and another settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to collectively as the ""Settlement Framework."" The Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political subdivisions are contingent upon the number of states and political subdivisions, including those states and political subdivisions who have not yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline. On December 20, 2022, the Company announced that it had settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories (the ""Settling States""), thus satisfying the initial threshold of required participation by Settling States. The settlement with the Settling States is now contingent upon, among other applicable terms and conditions, a sufficient number of political subdivisions also agreeing to participate in the Settlement Framework, which condition the Company believes will be satisfied. The Settlement Framework will become effective 15 days following a settlement administrator's determination that this condition has been satisfied. If the Settlement Framework becomes effective, then the Company will be required to deposit into an account up to the full portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States within 15 days following the effective date of the Settlement Framework. If all conditions for the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, the minimum participation thresholds applicable for the political subdivisions have been satisfied within the prescribed deadlines, then the Company would expect to pay up to the full portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States, beginning as early as the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and being completed during fiscal 2024. However, unless and until the settlement administrator has determined as such, the Company cannot predict if, when, or to what extent the Settlement Framework will be finalized with any of the Settling States. Through May 2023, the Company has paid approximately $ 0.6 billion in the aggregate for separate settlements with Cherokee Nation, New Mexico, Florida, West Virginia, and Alabama, as well as various Native American tribes (excluding Cherokee Nation) that agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline. Of the original approximately $ 3.3 billion accrued liability for the Settlement Framework and other settlements, approximately $ 2.8 billion remains and is recorded in accrued liabilities within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 30, 2023. 12 Table of Contents Other Opioid Related Litigation The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related litigation not covered or otherwise resolved by the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any other actions filed by healthcare providers, individuals, and third-party payers; as well as any action filed by a political subdivision or Native American tribe that is not resolved by the Settlement Framework. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a liability for these opioid-related litigation matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of any of these matters and no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Two-county Trial and MDL Bellwethers; and Canada. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $ 0.7 billion over fifteen years , on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the Company filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. The MDL has designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however, these five counties ultimately may elect to participate in the Settlement Framework and receive a portion of the Settlement Amount rather than go to trial. Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company have been named as defendants in two putative class action complaints filed in Canada related to dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. Opioid Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021, purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties had fully briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9, 2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which was filed on October 14, 2022, and which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017 through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021, alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other opioids litigation matters. On September 27, 2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the current Board and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business. The defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the Company's distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay the litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors appointed an independent Special Litigation Committee (the ""SLC"") to investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former officers and directors named in the various derivative proceedings regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out its duties. 13 Table of Contents Other Legal Proceedings Asda Equal Value Claims. Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, as well as additional claims in the High Court of the United Kingdom (the ""Asda Equal Value Claims""). Further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to certain of these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters. Money Transfer Agent Services Matters. The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the DOJ seeking documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company continues to cooperate with and provide information in response to requests from the DOJ. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the ""FTC"") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Walmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer agent services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 5, 2022, the FTC responded to the motion, and on October 28, 2022, the Company filed its reply. On March 27, 2023, the Court issued an opinion dismissing the FTC's claim under the Telemarketing Sales Rule and denying Walmart's motion to dismiss the claim under Section 5 of the FTC Act. On April 12, 2023, Walmart filed a motion to certify the Court's March 27, 2023, order for interlocutory appeal. The FTC's response to Walmart's motion to certify an interlocutory appeal was filed on May 8, 2023; Walmart's reply was filed on May 18, 2023. The FTC's amended complaint is due on June 30, 2023, subject to any further changes based upon the Court's ruling on the interlocutory appeal. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Note 7. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment significantly changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. 14 Table of Contents Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 103,901 $ 96,904 Walmart International 26,604 23,763 Sam's Club 20,499 19,621 Net sales $ 151,004 $ 140,288 Operating income by segment, as well as unallocated operating expenses for corporate and support, interest, net, and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 4,984 $ 4,462 Walmart International 1,164 772 Sam's Club 458 460 Corporate and support ( 366 ) ( 376 ) Operating income 6,240 5,318 Interest, net 557 419 Other (gains) and losses 2,995 1,998 Income before income taxes $ 2,688 $ 2,901 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category. When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024 (""fiscal 2024"") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three months ended April 30, 2023, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2023, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2023. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a relatively consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain and inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. 17 Table of Contents We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. However, like other retail companies, we have experienced continued inflation that impacts our merchandise costs. The impact to our net sales and gross profit margin is influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include, but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "" Item 5. Other Information ."" We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to pressure from inflation, a challenging macro environment, geopolitical conditions, supply chain disruptions, volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows: • Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience; • Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and • Returns - improve our Return on Investment (""ROI"") through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend. Growth Our objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We focus on comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three months ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, were as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 7.5 % 4.0 % (0.2) % 0.6 % Sam's Club 4.6 % 17.4 % (3.0) % 6.9 % Total U.S. 7.1 % 6.0 % (0.6) % 1.6 % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 7.1% for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 7.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2023, driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment increased 4.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2023. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in average ticket and transactions and included higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.5% to comparable sales for the three months ended April 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by Curbside Pickup and Ship to Home. 18 Table of Contents Margin Our objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth with a focus on incremental margin accretion through a combination of productivity improvements as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory, and reduce costs, and we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. Additionally, we focus on our mix of businesses, including the expansion of connected value streams with higher margins, such as advertising. Our objective is to achieve operating income leverage, which we define as growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales. Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net sales $ 151,004 $ 140,288 Percentage change from comparable period 7.6 % 2.3 % Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 23.7 % 23.8 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 20.4 % 21.0 % Operating income $ 6,240 $ 5,318 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.1 % 3.8 % Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") decreased 18 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to mix of sales globally, partially offset by the lapping of higher supply chain costs incurred in the previous year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 58 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by higher sales in each of our segments as well as operating discipline. Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased 34 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2023, due to the factors described above. Returns As we execute our strategic priorities, focusing on high return investments that drive operating leverage, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP"") and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 4.5% and 5.5% for the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the decrease in net income, which was driven by lower operating income, partially offset by lapping debt extinguishment charges. ROI was 12.7% and 13.9% for the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to the decrease in operating income which included opioid legal charges and reorganization and restructuring charges recorded during the second half of fiscal 2023. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. 19 Table of Contents The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 11,085 $ 13,232 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 245,598 $ 241,362 Return on assets (ROA) 4.5 % 5.5 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 21,350 $ 24,351 + Interest income 323 163 + Depreciation and amortization 11,110 10,679 + Rent 2,301 2,270 = ROI operating income $ 35,084 $ 37,463 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 245,598 $ 241,362 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 108,730 100,315 ' - Average accounts payable (1) 53,597 50,539 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 24,294 21,216 = Average invested capital $ 276,437 $ 269,922 Return on investment (ROI) 12.7 % 13.9 % (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2.

The following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Three Months Ended April 30, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2023 2022 Supply chain, customer-facing initiatives and technology $ 2,715 $ 2,063 Store and club remodels 1,236 981 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 4 11 Total U.S. 3,955 3,055 Walmart International 474 484 Total Capital Expenditures $ 4,429 $ 3,539 20 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by or used in operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2023, which represents an increase of $8.4 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases and timing of certain payments. Free cash flow for the three months ended April 30, 2023 was $0.2 billion, which represents an increase of $7.5 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash flow is due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $0.9 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow. Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 4,633 $ (3,758) Payments for property and equipment (4,429) (3,539) Free cash flow $ 204 $ (7,297) 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 Total revenues $ 152,301 $ 141,569 Percentage change from comparable period 7.6 % 2.4 % Net sales $ 151,004 $ 140,288 Percentage change from comparable period 7.6 % 2.3 % Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 7.1 % 6.0 % Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 23.7 % 23.8 % Operating income $ 6,240 $ 5,318 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.1 % 3.8 % Other (gains) and losses $ 2,995 $ 1,998 Consolidated net income $ 1,896 $ 2,103 Unit counts at period end 10,545 10,585 Retail square feet at period end 1,051 1,059 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales but also include membership and other income, increased $10.7 billion or 7.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increases in revenues were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which were driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions, along with positive comparable sales in most of our international markets. Net sales were negatively impacted by $0.2 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three months ended April 30, 2023. Gross profit rate decreased 18 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to mix of sales globally, partially offset by the lapping of higher supply chain costs incurred in the previous year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 58 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was driven by higher sales in each of our segments as well as operating discipline. Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. The net increase of $1.0 billion in other losses for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to an increase in net losses from changes in the fair value of our equity and other investments driven by decreases in their underlying stock prices. Our effective income tax rate was 29.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2023, compared to 27.5% for the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to the tax impact on changes in fair value of our investments. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income decreased $0.2 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Additionally, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased $0.2 billion, which included stronger results from our Walmex operations. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $0.62 for the three months ended April 30, 2023, which represents a decline of $0.12 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 Net sales $ 103,901 $ 96,904 Percentage change from comparable period 7.2 % 4.0 % Calendar comparable sales increase 7.5 % 4.0 % Operating income $ 4,984 $ 4,462 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.8 % 4.6 % Unit counts at period end 4,684 4,735 Retail square feet at period end 699 702 22 Table of Contents Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $7.0 billion or 7.2% for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was due to comparable sales of 7.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2023, driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.6% three months ended April 30, 2023, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. Gross profit rate decreased 41 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by product mix shifts into lower margin categories, partially offset by the lapping of higher supply chain costs incurred in the previous year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 65 basis points for three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by strong sales growth and the lapping of increased COVID-19 related wage costs in the previous year, partially offset by increased investments in wages. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.5 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 Net sales $ 26,604 $ 23,763 Percentage change from comparable period 12.0 % (13.0) % Operating income $ 1,164 $ 772 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.4 % 3.2 % Unit counts at period end 5,262 5,250 Retail square feet at period end 272 277 Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $2.8 billion or 12.0% for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in most of our international markets. These increases were partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $0.2 billion. Gross profit rate increased 12 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to the lapping of higher markdowns from slower sales growth in the previous year, partially offset by ongoing format and channel mix shifts. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 111 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales and operating efficiencies in most of our markets. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.4 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 Including Fuel Net sales $ 20,499 $ 19,621 Percentage change from comparable period 4.5 % 17.5 % Calendar comparable sales increase 4.6 % 17.4 % Operating income $ 458 $ 460 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.2 % 2.3 % Unit counts at period end 599 600 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 17,763 $ 16,532 Percentage change from comparable period 7.4 % 10.7 % Operating income $ 354 $ 335 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.0 % 2.0 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. 23 Table of Contents Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $0.9 billion or 4.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 4.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2023. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in average ticket and transactions and included higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.5% to comparable sales, which was primarily driven by Curbside Pickup and Ship to Home. Net sales were negatively impacted by lower fuel sales, which decreased $0.4 billion when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Gross profit rate increased 36 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to the lapping of increased supply chain costs. Membership and other income increased 4.7% for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was due to increases in new member sign-ups and Plus penetration. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 47 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by lower fuel sales and elevated technology spend. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased slightly when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by or Used in Operating Activities Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 4,633 $ (3,758) Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.6 billion as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $3.8 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases and timing of certain payments. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $10.6 billion and $11.8 billion at April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our working capital deficit was $17.0 billion as of April 30, 2023, which increased when compared to the $13.3 billion working capital deficit as of April 30, 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in short-term borrowings partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of April 30, 2023 and January 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash used in investing activities $ (4,860) $ (4,558) Net cash used in investing activities was $4.9 billion as compared to $4.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of $0.3 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2023 is primarily the result of an increase in payments for property and equipment. 24 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 1,940 $ 5,315 Net cash provided by financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.9 billion as compared to $5.3 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to decreases in short-term borrowings, partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2024 and fewer repurchases of Company stock. In April 2023, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at April 30, 2023, all undrawn. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the three months ended April 30, 2023: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2023 $ 4,191 $ 34,649 $ 38,840 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 4,967 4,967 Repayments of long-term debt (1,784) — (1,784) Reclassifications of long-term debt 1,572 (1,572) — Other (4) 76 72 Balances as of April 30, 2023 $ 3,975 $ 38,120 $ 42,095 During the three months ended April 30, 2023, our total outstanding long-term debt increased $3.3 billion primarily due to the issuance of new long-term debt in April 2023, partially offset by the maturities of certain long-term debt. Refer to Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the issuances and repayments of long-term debt. Dividends Effective February 21, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2024 annual dividend of $2.28 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share. For fiscal 2024, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.57 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 17, 2023 April 3, 2023 May 5, 2023 May 30, 2023 August 11, 2023 September 5, 2023 December 8, 2023 January 2, 2024 The dividend installments payable on April 3, 2023 and May 30, 2023 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended April 30, 2023 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of April 30, 2023, authorization for $18.6 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. 25 Table of Contents We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the three months ended April 30, 2023 and 2022: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 Total number of shares repurchased 4.8 16.9 Average price paid per share $ 143.46 $ 142.17 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 686 $ 2,408 Sale of Subsidiary Stock During the three months ended April 30, 2023, the Company received $0.5 billion related to new rounds of equity funding for the Company's majority-owned PhonePe subsidiary, which reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 89% as of January 31, 2023 to approximately 85%. Material Cash Requirements Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include opioid and other legal settlements, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, purchases of subsidiary stock and purchase obligations. Capital Resources We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of April 30, 2023, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. 26 Table of Contents Other Matters In Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies"" and appears in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "" Item 1.

The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. As of April 30, 2023, there were no material changes to our market risks disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 17, 2023, under the caption ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we began implementing a new financial system, including our general ledger, in stages beginning in our U.S. and Canadian markets. This financial system is a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to implement other components of our new financial system in stages, and each implementation will impact our internal control over financial reporting. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. Except for the new financial system implementation noted above, there has been no significant change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 27 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption ""Item 1. Financial Statements,"" in Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings."" We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of May 18, 2023. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion over fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The Company has filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive portion of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. The MDL has designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery. In addition, there are approximately 300 other cases pending in state and federal courts throughout the country as of May 18, 2023, as well as other cases in Canada against Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable, are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Opioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a Settlement Framework to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as described above), as described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company now has settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits brought by state and local governments against the Company. The settlement will take effect if a sufficient number of political subdivisions also join. As described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Settlement Framework will not become effective unless and until a settlement administrator determines whether a sufficient number of political subdivisions have agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al ., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed the Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion remains pending. Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the Company' s distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay the litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors appointed an independent Special Litigation Committee (the ""SLC"") to investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former officers and directors named in the various proceedings regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out its duties. 28 Table of Contents The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, purport to be filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017 through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v.

Money Transfer Agent Services Litigation: Federal Trade Commission v. Walmart Inc. (CV-3372), USDC, N. Dist. Of Ill, 6/28/22. 29 Table of Contents II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (""Flipkart""), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the ""Rules"") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements . III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million. In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc., and a trial date has been scheduled for April 22, 2024. The Company believes the suit is without merit and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption ""Risk Factors,"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended April 30, 2023 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of April 30, 2023, authorization for $18.6 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended April 30, 2023, was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) February 1 - 28, 2023 1,924,772 $ 143.12 1,924,772 $ 19.0 March 1 - 31, 2023 1,704,147 140.37 1,704,147 18.8 April 1 - 30, 2023 1,039,542 150.21 1,039,542 18.6 Total 4,668,461 4,668,461 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of October 2022 related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Use of Estimates The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interests that are redeemable outside the Company's control at fixed or determinable prices and dates are presented as temporary equity on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are recorded at the greater of the redemption fair value or the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and adjusted each reporting period for income, loss and any distributions made. As of October 31, 2022, the Company has a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to an acquisition in the Walmart U.S. segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option which may require the Company to purchase its interest beginning in December 2027 and annually thereafter. Inventories The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory for the Walmart International segment is generally valued in most markets by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (""FIFO"") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. If necessary, the Company records a LIFO adjustment during interim periods for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation which is adjusted to actual results based on rates and inventory levels at the end of the year. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for investors and other allocators of capital. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to each period in which a balance sheet is presented, except for disclosure of rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures. 9 Table of Contents Note 2. Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021. Further, the calculation of diluted net loss per common share attributable to Walmart for the three months ended October 31, 2022 does not include the effect of share-based payment awards as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive and would reduce the net loss per common share. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerator Consolidated net income (loss) $ ( 1,767 ) $ 3,132 $ 5,483 $ 10,307 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 31 ) ( 27 ) ( 78 ) ( 196 ) Consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Walmart $ ( 1,798 ) $ 3,105 $ 5,405 $ 10,111 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,711 2,785 2,733 2,799 Dilutive impact of share-based awards — 12 10 14 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,711 2,797 2,743 2,813 Net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ ( 0.66 ) $ 1.11 $ 1.98 $ 3.61 Diluted ( 0.66 ) 1.11 1.97 3.59 Note 3. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for derivative instruments are generally recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation and any related net investment hedge impacts resulting from a disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program. In April 2022, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364 -day revolving credit facility of $ 10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $ 5.0 billion. In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15.0 billion at October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the nine months ended October 31, 2022: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2022 $ 2,803 $ 34,864 $ 37,667 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 4,969 4,969 Repayments of long-term debt ( 1,439 ) — ( 1,439 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 4,181 ( 4,181 ) — Other ( 87 ) ( 1,717 ) ( 1,804 ) Balances as of October 31, 2022 $ 5,458 $ 33,935 $ 39,393 Debt Issuances Information on significant long-term debt issued during the nine months ended October 31, 2022, for general corporate purposes, is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Issue Date Principal Amount Maturity Date Fixed vs. Floating Interest Rate Net Proceeds September 9, 2022 $ 1,750 September 9, 2025 Fixed 3.900 % $ 1,744 September 9, 2022 $ 1,000 September 9, 2027 Fixed 3.950 % 994 September 9, 2022 $ 1,250 September 9, 2032 Fixed 4.150 % 1,239 September 9, 2022 $ 1,000 September 9, 2052 Fixed 4.500 % 992 Total $ 4,969 These issuances are senior, unsecured notes which rank equally with all other senior, unsecured debt obligations of the Company, and are not convertible or exchangeable. These issuances do not contain any financial covenants and do not restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase company stock. Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. 11 Table of Contents The Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain equity method investments, on a recurring basis in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of these investments is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of October 31, 2022 Fair Value as of January 31, 2022 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 3,432 $ 6,069 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 3,659 5,819 Total $ 7,091 $ 11,888 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: October 31, 2022 January 31, 2022 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 8,021 $ ( 869 ) (1) $ 8,021 $ ( 47 ) (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 5,435 ( 1,763 ) (1) 7,855 ( 1,048 ) (1) Total $ 13,456 $ ( 2,632 ) $ 15,876 $ ( 1,095 ) (1) Classified primarily in deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of October 31, 2022 in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, are as follows: October 31, 2022 January 31, 2022 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 39,393 $ 36,884 $ 37,667 $ 42,381 Note 6. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been recorded. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 12 Table of Contents Opioids Litigation General During the three months ended October 31, 2022, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $ 3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework (described below) and other previously agreed state and tribal settlements. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. Moreover, the Settlement Framework is in its early phases and there is no assurance that a sufficient number of necessary parties will participate in the Settlement Framework for it to become effective. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual. As to any opioid related litigation that is not covered or otherwise extinguished by the Settlement Framework, the Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from those matters and intends to vigorously defend those litigation matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of those matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid Related Litigation In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL"") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in the MDL. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $ 651 million over fifteen years , on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the Company filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as to both liability and abatement. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment has been stayed until December 15, 2022. The MDL has designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however, these five counties ultimately may elect to participate in the Settlement Framework described further below. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local, and tribal governments; healthcare providers; and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these state court cases and in the MDL are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. Settlement Framework On November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes whether as part of the MDL (excluding, however, the single, two-county trial pending appeal in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals) or other state court cases, as well as all potential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes for up to approximately $ 3.1 billion (the ""Settlement Amount""), which includes amounts for remediation of alleged harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent settlements by the Company. One settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the states and political subdivisions, and another settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to collectively as the ""Settlement Framework."" The Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political subdivisions are contingent upon the number of states and political subdivisions, including those states and political subdivisions who have not yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline (the ""Settling States""). Similarly, the Settlement Framework provides that payments to Native American tribes are contingent upon the number of tribes (excluding Cherokee Nation), including those tribes who have not yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline (the ""Settling Tribes""). 13 Table of Contents If all conditions for the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, the minimum participation thresholds applicable for the Settling Tribes are satisfied within prescribed deadlines, then the Company would expect to pay up to the full portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling Tribes, beginning as early as the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and being completed during fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2024. If all conditions for the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, the minimum participation thresholds applicable for the Settling States are satisfied within the prescribed deadlines, then the Company would expect to pay up to the full portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States, beginning as early as the second quarter of its fiscal year ending January 31, 2024 (""fiscal 2024"") and being completed in the same fiscal year. The Company cannot predict if or when the Settlement Framework will be finalized with any of the Settling States or any of the Settling Tribes. For those states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes that do not participate in the Settlement Framework, the Company cannot predict the number of such lawsuits that will remain or claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to those lawsuits and claims and intends to defend such lawsuits and claims vigorously. The Settlement Framework includes no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company. The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid related litigation not covered or otherwise extinguished by the Settlement Framework and continues to believe it has strong legal defenses and appellate arguments in those cases. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA""). The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Opioid Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties had fully briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9, 2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which was filed on October 14, 2022 and which revised the applicable class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021, and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other opioids litigation matters. On September 27, 2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the current Board and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business. The defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 27, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion on June 1, 2022; the defendants filed their reply brief on June 24, 2022. On September 26, 2022, the court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss and/or to stay, and a ruling on the motion remains pending. Asda Equal Value Claims Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees (the ""Asda Equal Value Claims""), and further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company will continue to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters. 14 Table of Contents Money Transfer Agent Services Matters The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") seeking documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company continues to provide information in response to requests from the DOJ. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the ""FTC"") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Walmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer agent services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, on October 5, 2022, the FTC responded to the motion, and on October 28, 2022, the Company filed its reply. The court has entered an order staying discovery pending briefing and a decision on the Company's motion to dismiss. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected . Note 7. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment significantly changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 104,775 $ 96,609 $ 306,809 $ 287,968 Walmart International 25,295 23,627 73,408 73,962 Sam's Club 21,399 18,971 62,921 54,307 Net sales $ 151,469 $ 139,207 $ 443,138 $ 416,237 15 Table of Contents Operating income by segment, as well as unallocated operating expenses for corporate and support, interest, net, loss on extinguishment of debt and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 5,093 $ 4,860 $ 15,238 $ 16,404 Walmart International 861 871 2,676 2,926 Sam's Club 562 475 1,449 1,710 Corporate and support ( 3,821 ) ( 414 ) ( 4,496 ) ( 985 ) Operating income 2,695 5,792 14,867 20,055 Interest, net 500 442 1,367 1,456 Loss on extinguishment of debt — 2,410 — 2,410 Other (gains) and losses 3,626 ( 1,207 ) 5,386 2,275 Income (loss) before income taxes $ ( 1,431 ) $ 4,147 $ 8,114 $ 13,914 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category. When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023"") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2022, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2022. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our flywheel strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a relatively consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain and inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. 17 Table of Contents We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. However, like other retail companies, we have seen continued supply chain disruptions contributing to higher than normal inventory levels. In addition, our merchandise costs for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 have been impacted by high inflation, greater than what we have experienced in recent years, which has increased costs and decreased profitability. The impact to our net sales and gross profit margin is influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include, but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "" Item 5. Other Information ."" We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to pressure from inflation, supply chain disruptions, volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence, ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including, among other matters, the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatment, any of which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our flywheel strategy while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, were as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 8.5 % 9.4 % 0.3 % 0.4 % 6.5 % 6.7 % 0.4 % 0.4 % Sam's Club 12.8 % 19.6 % 2.6 % 5.9 % 15.8 % 14.6 % 5.8 % 5.4 % Total U.S. 9.2 % 11.0 % 0.7 % 1.3 % 8.0 % 7.9 % 1.4 % 1.2 % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 9.2% and 8.0% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 8.5% and 6.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.0% and 0.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. 18 Table of Contents Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment increased 12.8% and 15.8% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.8% and 0.7% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, which was primarily driven by curbside and ship to home. Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory, and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net sales $ 151,469 $ 139,207 $ 443,138 $ 416,237 Percentage change from comparable period 8.8 % 4.1 % 6.5 % 3.0 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 34,505 $ 29,710 $ 94,076 $ 86,350 Percentage change from comparable period 16.1 % 3.9 % 8.9 % 1.6 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 22.8 % 21.3 % 21.2 % 20.7 % Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 144 and 48 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. The increases were largely driven by charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, partially offset by growth in net sales and lower incremental COVID-19 costs. In addition, the nine months ended October 31, 2022 were also impacted by increased wage costs in Walmart U.S. Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As such, we are allocating more capital to supply chain, customer-facing initiatives, technology and store remodels, and less to new store and club openings. The following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Nine Months Ended October 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2022 2021 Supply chain, customer-facing initiatives and technology $ 6,304 $ 4,408 Store and club remodels 3,965 2,375 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 33 112 Total U.S. 10,302 6,895 Walmart International 1,759 1,693 Total Capital Expenditures $ 12,061 $ 8,588 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 3.7% and 3.3% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in net income due primarily to lapping losses associated with our dispositions of Asda and Seiyu. ROI was 12.8% and 14.5% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to a decrease in operating income which included charges associated with opioid-related legal settlements recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. 19 Table of Contents Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 9,116 $ 8,299 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 246,254 $ 247,857 Return on assets (ROA) 3.7 % 3.3 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 20,754 $ 25,542 + Interest income 196 141 + Depreciation and amortization 10,840 10,771 + Rent 2,296 2,360 = ROI operating income $ 34,086 $ 38,814 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 246,254 $ 247,857 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 103,898 99,872 ' - Average accounts payable (1) 57,210 55,654 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 25,959 24,735 = Average invested capital $ 266,983 $ 267,340 Return on investment (ROI) 12.8 % 14.5 % (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. As of October 31, 2022 2021 2020 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 247,656 $ 244,851 $ 250,863 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 107,628 100,168 99,576 Accounts payable 57,263 57,156 54,152 Accrued liabilities 27,443 24,474 24,995 20 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $15.7 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2022, which represents a decline of $0.6 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline is primarily due to the timing of certain payments and a decrease in operating income, partially offset by moderated inventory purchases. Free cash flow for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 was $3.6 billion, which represents a decline of $4.1 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in free cash flow is due to the reduction in operating cash flows described above, as well as an increase of $3.5 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 15,698 $ 16,291 Payments for property and equipment (12,061) (8,588) Free cash flow $ 3,637 $ 7,703 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (12,965) $ (1,530) Net cash used in financing activities (5,581) (18,113) (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Total revenues $ 152,813 $ 140,525 $ 447,241 $ 419,883 Percentage change from comparable period 8.7% 4.3% 6.5 % 3.1% Net sales $ 151,469 $ 139,207 $ 443,138 $ 416,237 Percentage change from comparable period 8.8% 4.1% 6.5 % 3.0% Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 9.2% 11.0% 8.0 % 7.9% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 23.7% 24.6% 23.7 % 24.7% Operating income $ 2,695 $ 5,792 $ 14,867 $ 20,055 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 1.8% 4.2% 3.4 % 4.8% Other (gains) and losses $ 3,626 $ (1,207) $ 5,386 $ 2,275 Consolidated net income (loss) $ (1,767) $ 3,132 $ 5,483 $ 10,307 Unit counts at period end 10,586 10,566 10,586 10,566 Retail square feet at period end 1,056 1,065 1,056 1,065 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales but also include membership and other income, increased $12.3 billion or 8.7% and $27.4 billion or 6.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases in revenues were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which were impacted by higher inflation, along with positive comparable sales in most of our international markets. For the nine months ended October 31, 2022, these increases were partially offset by a net sales decrease of $5.0 billion related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net sales were negatively impacted by $1.5 billion and $2.8 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") decreased 89 and 103 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decrease for the three months ended October 31, 2022 was primarily due to markdowns and mix of sales in the U.S., an inflation related LIFO charge in the Sam's Club segment and the timing of sales events in our international markets. The decrease for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 was primarily due to markdowns and mix of sales in the U.S., higher supply chain costs and inflation related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 144 and 48 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were largely driven by charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, partially offset by growth in net sales and lower incremental COVID-19 costs. In addition, the nine months ended October 31, 2022 were also impacted by increased wage costs in Walmart U.S. Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. The net increase of $4.8 billion in other losses for the three months ended October 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to a net loss of $4.8 billion from changes in fair value of our equity and other investments. The net increase of $3.1 billion in other losses for the nine months ended October 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to: a net loss of $4.2 billion from changes in fair value of our equity and other investments; lapping $0.4 billion in incremental losses associated with the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan upon closing of the transactions during the first quarter of fiscal 2022; a gain of $0.4 billion recognized on the sale of our remaining equity method investment in Brazil during the second quarter of fiscal 2023; and a $0.2 billion dividend from one of our investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our effective income tax rate was (23.5)% and 32.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, compared to 24.5% and 25.9% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decrease in effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2022 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year is primarily due to tax expense on a quarterly pre-tax loss, which includes charges related to opioid-related legal settlements and changes in fair value of our investments. The increase in effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year includes the tax impact of charges associated with opioid-related legal settlements. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. 22 Table of Contents As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income decreased $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net loss per common share attributable to Walmart was $0.66 for the three months ended October 31, 2022, which represents a decline of $1.77 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $1.97 for the nine months ended October 31, 2022, which represents a decline of $1.62 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net sales $ 104,775 $ 96,609 $ 306,809 $ 287,968 Percentage change from comparable period 8.5 % 9.3 % 6.5 % 6.5 % Calendar comparable sales increase 8.5 % 9.4 % 6.5 % 6.7 % Operating income $ 5,093 $ 4,860 $ 15,238 $ 16,404 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.9 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.7 % Unit counts at period end 4,720 4,742 4,720 4,742 Retail square feet at period end 702 703 702 703 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $8.2 billion or 8.5% and $18.8 billion or 6.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to comparable sales of 8.5% and 6.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed 1.0% and 0.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. Gross profit rate decreased 77 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by net markdowns and product mix shifts into lower margin categories, partially offset by price management impacts driven by higher inflation. For the nine months ended October 31, 2022, gross profit rate decreased 75 basis points primarily due to net markdowns and product mix shifts into lower margin categories and increased supply chain costs, partially offset by price management impacts driven by higher inflation. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points for three months ended October 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by strong sales growth and lower incremental COVID-19 costs, partially offset by increased wage costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were relatively flat for the nine months ended October 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by increased wage costs, offset by strong sales growth. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.2 billion and decreased $1.2 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net sales $ 25,295 $ 23,627 $ 73,408 $ 73,962 Percentage change from comparable period 7.1 % (20.1) % (0.7) % (14.5) % Operating income $ 861 $ 871 $ 2,676 $ 2,926 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.4 % 3.7 % 3.6 % 4.0 % Unit counts at period end 5,266 5,224 5,266 5,224 Retail square feet at period end 274 282 274 282 Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $1.7 billion or 7.1% and decreased $0.6 billion or 0.7% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. For the three months ended October 31, 2022, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in most of our international markets which also outpaced inflation, and the earlier timing of sales events. These increases were partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $1.5 billion. For the nine months ended October 31, 2022, the reduction in net sales was due to a $5.0 billion decrease related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $2.8 billion. These decreases were largely offset by positive comparable sales which outpaced inflation in most of our remaining markets and the earlier timing of sales events. 23 Table of Contents Gross profit rate decreased 131 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2022 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by the earlier timing of sales events and continued growth in lower margin formats and channels in China. Gross profit rate decreased 87 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily driven by continued growth in lower margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower margin categories. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 136 basis points and 42 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales in our retained markets. For the three months ended October 31, 2022, the decrease was also driven by the earlier timing of sales events. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased slightly for the three months ended October 31, 2022, and decreased $0.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Additionally, the decline in operating income for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 was partially offset by a benefit of $0.2 billion related to an insurance settlement for Walmart Chile recorded in membership and other income during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Including Fuel Net sales $ 21,399 $ 18,971 $ 62,921 $ 54,307 Percentage change from comparable period 12.8 % 19.7 % 15.9 % 14.6 % Calendar comparable sales increase 12.8 % 19.6 % 15.8 % 14.6 % Operating income $ 562 $ 475 $ 1,449 $ 1,710 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.6 % 2.5 % 2.3 % 3.1 % Unit counts at period end 600 600 600 600 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 18,306 $ 16,614 $ 52,837 $ 47,988 Percentage change from comparable period 10.2 % 13.8 % 10.1 % 9.2 % Operating income $ 397 $ 368 $ 954 $ 1,473 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.2 % 2.2 % 1.8 % 3.1 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $2.4 billion or 12.8% and $8.6 billion or 15.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 12.8% and 15.8% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. Sam's Club eCommerce net sales positively contributed approximately 0.8% and 0.7% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, which was primarily driven by curbside and ship to home. Gross profit rate decreased 46 and 177 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases in gross profit rate were primarily due to inflation related LIFO charges. Additionally, the decrease for the nine months ended October 31, 2022, was impacted by elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs and inventory write-downs. Membership and other income increased 8.2% and 9.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase was due to increases in new member sign-ups and Plus penetration. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 68 and 106 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by higher sales. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.1 billion for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and decreased $0.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2022, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. 24 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 15,698 $ 16,291 Net cash provided by operating activities was $15.7 billion as compared to $16.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decline is primarily due to the timing of certain payments and a decrease in operating income, partially offset by moderated inventory purchases. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $11.6 billion and $16.1 billion at October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our working capital deficit was $13.7 billion as of October 31, 2022, which increased when compared to the $4.7 billion working capital deficit as of October 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase in short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in accrued liabilities, partially offset by an increase in inventory. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of October 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash used in investing activities $ (12,965) $ (1,530) Net cash used in investing activities was $13.0 billion as compared to $1.5 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of $11.4 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 is primarily the result of lapping the net proceeds received from the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan and an increase in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash used in financing activities $ (5,581) $ (18,113) Net cash from financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $5.6 billion as compared to $18.1 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and the related payment of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes in the prior fiscal period and an increase in short-term borrowings to fund working capital needs during the current fiscal period, partially offset by the equity funding from the sale of subsidiary stock in the prior fiscal period. In April 2022, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at October 31, 2022, all undrawn. 25 Table of Contents Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the nine months ended October 31, 2022: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2022 $ 2,803 $ 34,864 $ 37,667 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 4,969 4,969 Repayments of long-term debt (1,439) — (1,439) Reclassifications of long-term debt 4,181 (4,181) — Other (87) (1,717) (1,804) Balances as of October 31, 2022 $ 5,458 $ 33,935 $ 39,393 During the nine months ended October 31, 2022, our total outstanding long-term debt increased $1.7 billion primarily due to the issuance of new long-term debt in September 2022, partially offset by the maturities of certain long-term debt. Refer to Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the issuances of long-term debt. Dividends Effective February 17, 2022, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2022 annual dividend of $2.20 per share. For fiscal 2023, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.56 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 18, 2022 April 4, 2022 May 6, 2022 May 31, 2022 August 12, 2022 September 6, 2022 December 9, 2022 January 3, 2023 The dividend installments payable on April 4, 2022, May 31, 2022, and September 6, 2022 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. As of October 31, 2022, authorization for $1.9 billion of share repurchases remained under the existing share repurchase program. On November 14, 2022, the Company approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. Beginning November 21, 2022, the new share repurchase program replaced the existing share repurchase program, which had remaining authorization of $1.4 billion for share repurchases. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the nine months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021: Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Total number of shares repurchased 65.5 52.7 Average price paid per share $ 132.86 $ 139.76 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 8,708 $ 7,368 Purchase of Subsidiary Stock In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's Massmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership of Massmart to 100%. Material Cash Requirements Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. 26 Table of Contents Capital Resources We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of October 31, 2022, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. As of October 31, 2022, there were no material changes to our market risks disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on March 18, 2022, under the caption "" Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 27 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 28 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption ""Item 1. Financial Statements,"" in Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings."" We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,150 cases as of November 14, 2022. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $651 million over fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The Company has filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as to both liability and abatement. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive portion of the judgment has been stayed until December 15, 2022. The MDL has designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery. In addition, there are over 275 other cases as of November 14, 2022, pending in state and federal courts throughout the country. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable, are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Opioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a Settlement Framework to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as described above), as described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA"") related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al ., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed the Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in the Chancery Court in Delaware. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, were purportedly filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016, through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which revised the applicable class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in Delaware Court of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 27, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion on June 1, 2022; the defendants filed their reply brief on June 24, 2022; and the court held a hearing on September 26, 2022. A ruling from the court on the motion to dismiss and/or stay remains pending. Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v. McMillon et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 4/16/21: Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund et al. v. Walton et al., DE Court of Chancery, 9/27/21. Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and Martin v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC , Dist. of DE, 3/5/21, consolidated into In re Walmart Inc. Securities Litigation , USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21. 29 Table of Contents ASDA Equal Value Claims : Ms S Brierley & Others v.

Money Transfer Agent Services Litigation: Federal Trade Commission v. Walmart Inc. (CV-3372), USDC, N. Dist. Of Ill, 6/28/22. 30 Table of Contents II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (""Flipkart""), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the ""Rules"") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its consolidated financial statements . III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million. In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc., and a trial date has been scheduled for April 22, 2024. The Company believes the suit is without merit and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption ""Risk Factors,"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. As of October 31, 2022, authorization for $1.9 billion of share repurchases remained under the existing share repurchase program. On November 14, 2022, the Company approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. Beginning November 21, 2022, the new share repurchase program replaced the existing share repurchase program, which had remaining authorization of $1.4 billion for share repurchases. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended October 31, 2022, was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) August 1 - 31, 2022 8,235,960 $ 132.37 8,235,960 $ 3.8 September 1 - 30, 2022 6,976,006 133.66 6,976,006 2.8 October 1 - 31, 2022 6,758,939 134.43 6,758,939 1.9 Total 21,970,905 21,970,905 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month. Item 5. Other Information Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that Walmart believes are ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act as well as protections afforded by other federal securities laws.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of July 2022 related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Use of Estimates The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interests which are redeemable outside the Company's control at fixed or determinable prices and dates are presented as temporary equity on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are recorded at the greater of the redemption fair value or the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and adjusted each reporting period for income, loss and any distributions made. As of July 31, 2022, the Company has a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to an acquisition in the Walmart U.S. segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option which may require the Company to purchase their interest beginning in December 2027 and annually thereafter. Inventories The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") method for the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory for the Walmart International segment is generally valued in most markets by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out (""FIFO"") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. If necessary, the Company records a LIFO adjustment during interim periods for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation which is adjusted to actual results based on rates and inventory levels at the end of the year. 8 Table of Contents Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 5,147 $ 4,364 $ 7,250 $ 7,175 Consolidated net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest 2 ( 88 ) ( 47 ) ( 169 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 5,149 $ 4,276 $ 7,203 $ 7,006 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,736 2,799 2,745 2,807 Dilutive impact of share-based awards 9 13 10 13 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,745 2,812 2,755 2,820 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 1.88 $ 1.53 $ 2.62 $ 2.50 Diluted 1.88 1.52 2.61 2.48 Note 3. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for derivative instruments are generally recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation and any related net investment hedge impacts resulting from a disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The following tables provide the changes in the composition of total accumulated other comprehensive loss: (Amounts in millions and net of immaterial income taxes) Currency Translation and Other Net Investment Hedges Cash Flow Hedges Minimum Pension Liability Total Balances as of February 1, 2022 $ ( 8,100 ) $ 94 $ ( 748 ) $ ( 12 ) $ ( 8,766 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications, net 225 — 26 — 251 Reclassifications to income, net — — 16 1 17 Balances as of April 30, 2022 $ ( 7,875 ) $ 94 $ ( 706 ) $ ( 11 ) $ ( 8,498 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net ( 796 ) — ( 622 ) 2 ( 1,416 ) Reclassifications to income, net ( 309 ) — 329 — 20 Balances as of July 31, 2022 $ ( 8,980 ) $ 94 $ ( 999 ) $ ( 9 ) $ ( 9,894 ) (Amounts in millions and net of immaterial income taxes) Currency Translation and Other Net Investment Hedges Cash Flow Hedges Minimum Pension Liability Total Balances as of February 1, 2021 $ ( 10,772 ) $ 1,296 $ ( 304 ) $ ( 1,986 ) $ ( 11,766 ) Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications, net ( 225 ) ( 7 ) ( 26 ) ( 1 ) ( 259 ) Reclassifications related to business dispositions, net (1) 3,258 ( 1,195 ) 30 1,966 4,059 Reclassifications to income, net — — 16 4 20 Balances as of April 30, 2021 $ ( 7,739 ) $ 94 $ ( 284 ) $ ( 17 ) $ ( 7,946 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net 123 — ( 193 ) ( 3 ) ( 73 ) Reclassifications to income, net — — 38 5 43 Balances as of July 31, 2021 $ ( 7,616 ) $ 94 $ ( 439 ) $ ( 15 ) $ ( 7,976 ) (1) Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss, the majority of which was considered in the impairment evaluation when the individual disposal groups met the held for sale classification in fiscal 2021. 9 Table of Contents Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program. In April 2022, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364 -day revolving credit facility of $ 10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $ 5.0 billion. In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15.0 billion at July 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the six months ended July 31, 2022: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2022 $ 2,803 $ 34,864 $ 37,667 Repayments of long-term debt ( 1,439 ) — ( 1,439 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 4,030 ( 4,030 ) — Other ( 78 ) ( 1,033 ) ( 1,111 ) Balances as of July 31, 2022 $ 5,316 $ 29,801 $ 35,117 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain equity method investments, on a recurring basis in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of these investments is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of July 31, 2022 Fair Value as of January 31, 2022 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 4,773 $ 6,069 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 5,919 5,819 Total $ 10,692 $ 11,888 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of July 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: July 31, 2022 January 31, 2022 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 8,021 $ ( 453 ) (1) $ 8,021 $ ( 47 ) (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 5,682 ( 1,446 ) (1) 7,855 ( 1,048 ) (1) Total $ 13,703 $ ( 1,899 ) $ 15,876 $ ( 1,095 ) (1) Classified primarily in deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of July 31, 2022. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. 10 Table of Contents The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of July 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, are as follows: July 31, 2022 January 31, 2022 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 35,117 $ 36,367 $ 37,667 $ 42,381 Note 6. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been recorded. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Opioids Litigation In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL"") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases began on October 4, 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims. On November 23, 2021, the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial to determine amounts owed by the defendants and any injunctive relief ended on May 17, 2022. On August 17, 2022, the court ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay approximately $ 651 million over fifteen years , on a joint and several liability basis. The court also ordered the defendants to pay approximately $ 87 million of the total abatement amount into an abatement fund on or before October 1, 2022, reflecting the first two years of abatement. However, the Company plans to appeal both the jury verdict from the liability phase and the court's abatement order. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, healthcare providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA""). The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed the Company's motion to dismiss, the District Court stayed proceedings in the case pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Ruan v. United States and Kahn v. United States, 142 S. Ct. 2370 (Jun. 27, 2022) (""Ruan"") regarding matters under the CSA. Following the decision in Ruan and pursuant to an agreement of the parties, the District Court set a deadline of October 7, 2022 for the DOJ to file an amended complaint or move for leave to amend its complaint. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action; the lead plaintiff responded to the motion on January 10, 2022; and the defendants filed their reply brief on February 10, 2022. A hearing on the motion is currently scheduled for September 9, 2022. Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and 11 Table of Contents other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other Opioids Litigation matters. On September 27, 2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the current Board and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business. The defendants filed the opening brief on their motion to dismiss that case on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 27, 2022, the defendants filed their opening brief in support of their motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion on June 1, 2022; the defendants filed their reply brief on June 24, 2022; and the motion has been scheduled for a hearing on September 26, 2022. While the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss from certain of the various Opioid litigation matters, the Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters and intends to vigorously defend these litigation matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Asda Equal Value Claims Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees (the ""Asda Equal Value Claims""), and further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company will continue to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters. Money Transfer Agent Services Matters The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") seeking documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company continues to provide information in response to requests from the DOJ. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the ""FTC"") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Walmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer agent services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and the court has entered an order staying discovery pending briefing and a decision on the Company's motion to dismiss. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Note 7. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. 12 Table of Contents The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment significantly changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 105,130 $ 98,192 $ 202,034 $ 191,359 Walmart International 24,350 23,035 48,113 50,335 Sam's Club 21,901 18,644 41,522 35,336 Net sales $ 151,381 $ 139,871 $ 291,669 $ 277,030 Operating income by segment, as well as unallocated operating expenses for corporate and support, interest, net, and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 5,683 $ 6,089 $ 10,145 $ 11,544 Walmart International 1,043 861 1,815 2,055 Sam's Club 427 660 887 1,235 Corporate and support ( 299 ) ( 256 ) ( 675 ) ( 571 ) Operating income 6,854 7,354 12,172 14,263 Interest, net 448 478 867 1,014 Other (gains) and losses ( 238 ) 953 1,760 3,482 Income before income taxes $ 6,644 $ 5,923 $ 9,545 $ 9,767 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category. When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023"") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2022, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2022. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our flywheel strategy such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, supply chain disruptions, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. 15 Table of Contents We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. However, like other retail companies, we have seen continued supply chain disruptions contributing to higher than normal inventory levels. In addition, our merchandise costs for the six months ended July 31, 2022 have been impacted by high inflation, greater than what we have experienced in recent years which has increased costs and decreased profitability. The impact to our net sales and gross profit margin is influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include, but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "" Item 5. Other Information ."" We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to pressure from inflation, supply chain disruptions, volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence, ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including, among other matters, the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatment, any of which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our flywheel strategy while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, were as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 7.0 % 5.4 % 0.6 % 0.4 % 5.5 % 5.4 % 0.5 % 0.4 % Sam's Club 17.3 % 13.9 % 8.0 % 6.2 % 17.4 % 12.0 % 7.5 % 5.0 % Total U.S. 8.7 % 6.7 % 1.9 % 1.3 % 7.4 % 6.4 % 1.7 % 1.1 % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 8.7% and 7.4% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 7.0% and 5.5% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as a slight increase in transactions. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.6% for the three months ended July 31, 2022, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. For the six months ended July 31, 2022, eCommerce sales growth had a negligible impact on the Walmart U.S. segment total comparable sales growth. 16 Table of Contents Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment increased 17.3% and 17.4% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.8% and 0.7% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively. Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory, and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net sales $ 151,381 $ 139,871 $ 291,669 $ 277,030 Percentage change from comparable period 8.2 % 2.2 % 5.3 % 2.4 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 30,167 $ 28,511 $ 59,571 $ 56,640 Percentage change from comparable period 5.8 % (1.7) % 5.2 % 0.5 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 19.9 % 20.4 % 20.4 % 20.4 % Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 45 and 3 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease for the three months ended July 31, 2022 was primarily driven by growth in net sales, partially offset by increased wage costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. The slight decrease for the six months ended July 31, 2022 was primarily driven by growth in net sales and lower incremental COVID-19 costs, partially offset by increased wage costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As such, we are allocating more capital to supply chain, customer-facing initiatives, technology and store remodels, and less to new store and club openings. The following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Six Months Ended July 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2022 2021 Supply chain, customer-facing initiatives and technology $ 4,106 $ 2,454 Store and club remodels 2,377 1,446 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 21 73 Total U.S. 6,504 3,973 Walmart International 988 1,046 Total Capital Expenditures $ 7,492 $ 5,019 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.8% and 4.4% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in net income. ROI was 13.8% and 14.8% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to a decrease in operating income and increase in average total assets driven by higher inventories. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. 17 Table of Contents Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 14,015 $ 10,368 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 242,876 $ 237,967 Return on assets (ROA) 5.8 % 4.4 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 23,851 $ 25,528 + Interest income 155 122 + Depreciation and amortization 10,733 10,892 + Rent 2,302 2,451 = ROI operating income $ 37,041 $ 38,993 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 242,876 $ 237,967 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 102,155 97,685 ' - Average accounts payable (1) 51,896 47,964 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 23,878 23,842 = Average invested capital $ 269,257 $ 263,846 Return on investment (ROI) 13.8 % 14.8 % (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2. As of July 31, 2022 2021 2020 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 247,199 $ 238,552 $ 237,382 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 105,963 98,346 97,023 Accounts payable 54,191 49,601 46,326 Accrued liabilities 23,843 23,915 23,768 18 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2022, which represents a decline of $3.2 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline is primarily due to a decrease in operating income, higher inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and the timing of certain payments. Free cash flow for the six months ended July 31, 2022 was $1.7 billion, which represents a decline of $5.7 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in free cash flow is due to the reduction in operating cash flows described above, as well as an increase of $2.5 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,240 $ 12,423 Payments for property and equipment (7,492) (5,019) Free cash flow $ 1,748 $ 7,404 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (1) $ (8,584) $ 2,402 Net cash used in financing activities (1,400) (11,559) (1) ""Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 19 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Total revenues $ 152,859 $ 141,048 $ 294,428 $ 279,358 Percentage change from comparable period 8.4% 2.4% 5.4 % 2.6% Net sales $ 151,381 $ 139,871 $ 291,669 $ 277,030 Percentage change from comparable period 8.2% 2.2% 5.3 % 2.4% Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 8.7% 6.7% 7.4 % 6.4% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 23.5% 24.8% 23.7 % 24.8% Operating income $ 6,854 $ 7,354 $ 12,172 $ 14,263 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.5% 5.3% 4.2 % 5.1% Other (gains) and losses $ (238) $ 953 $ 1,760 $ 3,482 Consolidated net income $ 5,147 $ 4,364 $ 7,250 $ 7,175 Unit counts at period end 10,585 10,524 10,585 10,524 Retail square feet at period end 1,057 1,063 1,057 1,063 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $11.8 billion or 8.4% and $15.1 billion or 5.4% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases in revenues were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which were impacted by higher inflation, along with positive comparable sales in most of our international markets. For the six months ended July 31, 2022, these increases were partially offset by a net sales decrease of $5.0 billion related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net sales were negatively impacted by $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") decreased 132 and 110 basis points respectively for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decrease for the three months ended July 31, 2022 was primarily due to markdowns and mix of sales in the U.S., as well as an inflation related LIFO charge in the Sam's Club segment. The decrease for the six months ended July 31, 2022 was primarily due to mix of sales and markdowns in the U.S. and higher supply chain costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 45 and 3 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decrease for the three months ended July 31, 2022 was primarily driven by growth in net sales, partially offset by increased wage costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. The slight decrease for the six months ended July 31, 2022 was primarily driven by growth in net sales and lower incremental COVID-19 costs, partially offset by increased wage costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. The net increase of $1.2 billion in other gains for the three months ended July 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to: a net gain of $0.6 billion from changes in fair value of our equity and other investments; a gain of $0.4 billion recognized on the sale of our remaining equity method investment in Brazil; and a $0.2 billion dividend from one of our investments. The net decrease of $1.7 billion in other losses for the six months ended July 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to: a net gain of $0.6 billion from changes in fair value of our equity and other investments; lapping $0.4 billion in incremental losses associated with the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan upon closing of the transactions during the first quarter of fiscal 2022; a gain of $0.4 billion recognized on the sale of our remaining equity method investment in Brazil during the second quarter of fiscal 2023; and a $0.2 billion dividend from one of our investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our effective income tax rate was 22.5% and 24.0% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, compared to 26.3% and 26.5% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decrease in effective tax rate includes the gain recognized on the sale of our remaining equity method investment in Brazil which provided minimal realizable tax expense and a discrete tax item recognized during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. 20 Table of Contents As a result of the factors discussed above, as well as a benefit in membership and other income related to an insurance settlement for Walmart Chile, consolidated net income increased $0.8 billion and $0.1 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $1.88 and $2.61 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, which represents respective increases of $0.36 and $0.13 when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net sales $ 105,130 $ 98,192 $ 202,034 $ 191,359 Percentage change from comparable period 7.1 % 5.3 % 5.6 % 5.1 % Calendar comparable sales increase 7.0 % 5.4 % 5.5 % 5.4 % Operating income $ 5,683 $ 6,089 $ 10,145 $ 11,544 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.4 % 6.2 % 5.0 % 6.0 % Unit counts at period end 4,735 4,740 4,735 4,740 Retail square feet at period end 702 703 702 703 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $6.9 billion or 7.1% and $10.7 billion or 5.6% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to comparable sales of 7.0% and 5.5% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as a slight increase in transactions. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.6% for the three months ended July 31, 2022, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. For the six months ended July 31, 2022, eCommerce sales growth had a negligible impact on the Walmart U.S. segment total comparable sales growth. Gross profit rate decreased 106 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by product mix shifts into lower margin categories and net markdowns, partially offset by price management impacts driven by higher inflation. For the six months ended July 31, 2022, gross profit rate decreased 74 basis points primarily due to product mix shifts into lower margin categories and increased supply chain costs, partially offset by price management impacts driven by higher inflation. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 21 basis points for three months ended July 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by strong sales growth and lower incremental COVID-19 costs, partially offset by increased wage costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 35 basis points for the six months ended July 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by increased wage costs, partially offset by strong sales growth and lower incremental COVID-19 costs. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $0.4 billion and $1.4 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net sales $ 24,350 $ 23,035 $ 48,113 $ 50,335 Percentage change from comparable period 5.7 % (15.2) % (4.4) % (11.6) % Operating income $ 1,043 $ 861 $ 1,815 $ 2,055 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.3 % 3.7 % 3.8 % 4.1 % Unit counts at period end 5,250 5,185 5,250 5,185 Retail square feet at period end 274 280 274 280 Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $1.3 billion or 5.7% and decreased $2.2 billion or 4.4% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. For the three months ended July 31, 2022, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in most of our international markets, partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $1.0 billion. For the six months ended July 31, 2022, the reduction in net sales was due to a $5.0 billion decrease related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as well as negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $1.3 billion, partially offset by positive comparable sales in each of our remaining markets. Gross profit rate decreased 18 basis points and 63 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats and 21 Table of Contents channels in China and category mix shifts into lower margin categories. Divested markets further impacted the gross profit rate for the six months ended July 31, 2022. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 7 basis points and increased 6 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. For the three months ended July 31, 2022, the decrease was primarily driven by strong sales growth, partially offset by planned strategic investments. For the six months ended July 31, 2022, the increase was primarily due to impacts from the divested markets, partially offset by strong sales growth. As a result of the factors discussed above, as well as a benefit of $0.2 billion related to an insurance settlement for Walmart Chile recorded in membership and other income, operating income increased $0.2 billion and decreased $0.2 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Including Fuel Net sales $ 21,901 $ 18,644 $ 41,522 $ 35,336 Percentage change from comparable period 17.5 % 13.9 % 17.5 % 12.0 % Calendar comparable sales increase 17.3 % 13.9 % 17.4 % 12.0 % Operating income $ 427 $ 660 $ 887 $ 1,235 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 1.9 % 3.5 % 2.1 % 3.5 % Unit counts at period end 600 599 600 599 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 17,999 $ 16,437 $ 34,531 $ 31,374 Percentage change from comparable period 9.5 % 7.7 % 10.1 % 7.0 % Operating income $ 222 $ 575 $ 557 $ 1,105 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 1.2 % 3.5 % 1.6 % 3.5 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $3.3 billion or 17.5% and $6.2 billion or 17.5% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 17.3% and 17.4% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. Sam's Club eCommerce net sales positively contributed approximately 0.8% and 0.7% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively. Gross profit rate decreased 272 and 245 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases in gross profit rate were due to inventory write-downs, including an inflation related LIFO charge, and elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs. Membership and other income increased 8.4% and 10.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase was due to increases in new member sign-ups and Plus penetration. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 131 and 124 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by higher sales. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2022, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 22 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,240 $ 12,423 Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.2 billion as compared to $12.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decline is primarily due to a decrease in operating income, higher inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and the timing of certain payments. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $13.9 billion and $22.8 billion at July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our working capital deficit was $15.7 billion as of July 31, 2022, which increased when compared to $2.9 billion as of July 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase in short-term borrowings and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by the increase in inventory described above. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of July 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $3.5 billion at July 31, 2022, approximately $1.1 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized by Flipkart. Net Cash Used in or Provided by Investing Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities $ (8,584) $ 2,402 Net cash used in investing activities was $8.6 billion as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $2.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities increased $11.0 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2022 primarily as a result of lapping the net proceeds received from the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan and an increase in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,400) $ (11,559) Net cash from financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion as compared to $11.6 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to an increase in short-term borrowings to fund working capital needs. In April 2022, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at July 31, 2022, all undrawn. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the six months ended July 31, 2022: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2022 $ 2,803 $ 34,864 $ 37,667 Repayments of long-term debt (1,439) — (1,439) Reclassifications of long-term debt 4,030 (4,030) — Other (78) (1,033) (1,111) Balances as of July 31, 2022 $ 5,316 $ 29,801 $ 35,117 23 Table of Contents Dividends Effective February 17, 2022, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2022 annual dividend of $2.20 per share. For fiscal 2023, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.56 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 18, 2022 April 4, 2022 May 6, 2022 May 31, 2022 August 12, 2022 September 6, 2022 December 9, 2022 January 3, 2023 The dividend installments payable on April 4, 2022 and May 31, 2022 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the six months ended July 31, 2022 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in February 2021, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of July 31, 2022, authorization for $4.9 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the six months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021: Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Total number of shares repurchased 43.3 37.7 Average price paid per share $ 132.74 $ 137.94 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 5,747 $ 5,200 Material Cash Requirements Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. Capital Resources We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of July 31, 2022, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. 24 Table of Contents The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. As of July 31, 2022, there were no material changes to our market risks disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on March 18, 2022, under the caption "" Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 25 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption ""Item 1. Financial Statements,"" in Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings."" We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,150 cases as of August 17, 2022. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases began on October 4, 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims. On November 23, 2021, the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial to determine amounts owed by the defendants and injunctive relief ended on May 17, 2022. On August 17, 2022, the court ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay approximately $651 million over fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis. The court also ordered the defendants to pay approximately $87 million of the total abatement amount into an abatement fund on or before October 1, 2022, reflecting the first two years of abatement. However, the Company plans to appeal the jury verdict from the liability phase and the court's abatement order. In addition, there are over 250 state court cases pending as of August 17, 2022. This includes certain cases that were remanded by the MDL court and a case brought by the Cherokee Nation that was remanded by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma to the District Court of Sequoya County, Oklahoma. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable, for the state court cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including, among others, State of New Mexico ex rel. Balderas v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al. and State of West Virginia ex rel. Morrisey v. Walmart Inc., et al., which currently have trial dates scheduled to occur on September 6, 2022 and September 26, 2022, respectively. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA"") related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al ., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed the Company's motion to dismiss, the District court stayed proceedings in the case pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Ruan v. United States and Kahn v. United States , 142 S. Ct. 2370 (Jun. 27, 2022) ("" Ruan"" ) regarding matters under the CSA. Following the decision in Ruan and pursuant to an agreement of the parties, the District Court set a deadline of October 7, 2022 for the DOJ to file an amended complaint or move for leave to amend its complaint. Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other Opioids Litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in the Chancery Court in Delaware. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, were purportedly filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016, through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021; the lead plaintiff responded to the motion on January 10, 2022; and the defendants filed their reply brief on February 10, 2022. A hearing on the motion is currently scheduled for September 9, 2022. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in Delaware Chancery Court filed the opening brief on their motion to dismiss that case on December 21, 2021; and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 27, 2022, the defendants filed their opening brief in support of their motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion on June 1, 2022; the defendants filed their reply brief on June 24, 2022; and the motion has been scheduled for a hearing on September 26, 2022.

CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (""Flipkart""), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the ""Rules"") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, or whether the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million. In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc . The Company believes the suit is without merit and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. 28 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption ""Risk Factors,"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended July 31, 2022 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in February 2021, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of July 31, 2022, authorization for $4.9 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended July 31, 2022, was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) May 1 - 31, 2022 7,062,901 $ 132.30 7,062,901 $ 7.3 June 1 - 30, 2022 10,979,635 122.28 10,979,635 6.0 July 1 - 31, 2022 8,742,142 126.87 8,742,142 4.9 Total 26,784,678 26,784,678 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month.

The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of April 2022 related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Use of Estimates The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interests which are redeemable outside the Company's control at fixed or determinable prices and dates are presented as temporary equity on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are recorded at the greater of the redemption value or the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and adjusted each reporting period for income, loss and any distributions made. As of April 30, 2022, the Company has a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to a recent acquisition in the Walmart U.S. segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option which may require the Company to purchase their interest at fair value beginning in December 2027 and annually thereafter. 8 Table of Contents Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 2,103 $ 2,811 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 49 ) ( 81 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 2,054 $ 2,730 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,754 2,815 Dilutive impact of share-based awards 11 14 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,765 2,829 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 0.75 $ 0.97 Diluted 0.74 0.97 Note 3. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for derivative instruments are generally recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation and any related net investment hedge impacts resulting from a disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The following tables provide the changes in the composition of total accumulated other comprehensive loss: (Amounts in millions and net of immaterial income taxes) Currency Translation and Other Net Investment Hedges Cash Flow Hedges Minimum Pension Liability Total Balances as of February 1, 2022 $ ( 8,100 ) $ 94 $ ( 748 ) $ ( 12 ) $ ( 8,766 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications, net 225 — 26 — 251 Reclassifications to income, net — — 16 1 17 Balances as of April 30, 2022 $ ( 7,875 ) $ 94 $ ( 706 ) $ ( 11 ) $ ( 8,498 ) (Amounts in millions and net of immaterial income taxes) Currency Translation and Other Net Investment Hedges Cash Flow Hedges Minimum Pension Liability Total Balances as of February 1, 2021 $ ( 10,772 ) $ 1,296 $ ( 304 ) $ ( 1,986 ) $ ( 11,766 ) Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications, net ( 225 ) ( 7 ) ( 26 ) ( 1 ) ( 259 ) Reclassifications related to business dispositions, net (1) 3,258 ( 1,195 ) 30 1,966 4,059 Reclassifications to income, net — — 16 4 20 Balances as of April 30, 2021 $ ( 7,739 ) $ 94 $ ( 284 ) $ ( 17 ) $ ( 7,946 ) (1) Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss, the majority of which was considered in the impairment evaluation when the individual disposal groups met the held for sale classification in fiscal 2021. 9 Table of Contents Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program. In April 2022, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364 -day revolving credit facility of $ 10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $ 5.0 billion. In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15.0 billion at April 30, 2022 and January 31, 2022, all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the three months ended April 30, 2022: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2022 $ 2,803 $ 34,864 $ 37,667 Repayments of long-term debt ( 926 ) — ( 926 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 1,750 ( 1,750 ) — Other ( 47 ) ( 940 ) ( 987 ) Balances as of April 30, 2022 $ 3,580 $ 32,174 $ 35,754 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments on a recurring basis in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the Company's equity investments measured on a recurring basis is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of April 30, 2022 Fair Value as of January 31, 2022 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 5,080 $ 6,069 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 4,810 5,819 Total $ 9,890 $ 11,888 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of April 30, 2022 and January 31, 2022, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: April 30, 2022 January 31, 2022 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 8,021 $ ( 539 ) (1) $ 8,021 $ ( 47 ) (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 6,428 ( 1,121 ) (1) 7,855 ( 1,048 ) (1) Total $ 14,449 $ ( 1,660 ) $ 15,876 $ ( 1,095 ) (1) Classified primarily in deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of April 30, 2022. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. 10 Table of Contents The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of April 30, 2022 and January 31, 2022, are as follows: April 30, 2022 January 31, 2022 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 35,754 $ 36,680 $ 37,667 $ 42,381 Note 6. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been recorded. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Opioids Litigation In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL"") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. The liability phase of a trial in one of the MDL cases began on October 4, 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims. On November 23, 2021, the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the trial, which will determine amounts owed by the defendants, began on May 10, 2022 and ended on May 17, 2022, and the parties will await a ruling from the court. The Company intends to appeal the jury verdict from the liability phase upon completion of the abatement phase of the trial. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act (the""CSA""). The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. The DOJ filed its opposition brief on April 23, 2021 and the Company filed its reply brief on May 24, 2021. On November 19, 2021, the District Court stayed further proceedings in the DOJ complaint pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in two consolidated cases (not involving Walmart) interpreting the CSA. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action; the lead plaintiff responded to the motion on January 10, 2022; and the defendants filed their reply brief on February 10, 2022. Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other Opioids Litigation matters. On September 27, 2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the current Board and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to 11 Table of Contents adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business. The defendants filed the opening brief on their motion to dismiss that case on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 27, 2022, the defendants filed their opening brief in support of their motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from the various Opioids Litigation and intends to vigorously defend these litigation matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Asda Equal Value Claims Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees (the ""Asda Equal Value Claims""), and further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company will continue to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters. Money Transfer Agent Services Matters The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas and is cooperating with the government's investigation. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the ""FTC"") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. While the Company had been engaged in discussions with the FTC regarding a potential resolution of this matter, the parties have not been able to reach a resolution. In May 2022, the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection forwarded a revised draft complaint to the FTC seeking authority to file a civil complaint against the Company seeking various forms of monetary and injunctive relief regarding the Company’s anti-fraud program. The Company understands that the FTC voted to authorize the complaint on June 1, 2022. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. While the Company does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Note 7. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment significantly changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. 12 Table of Contents Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 96,904 $ 93,167 Walmart International 23,763 27,300 Sam's Club 19,621 16,692 Net sales $ 140,288 $ 137,159 Operating income by segment, as well as unallocated operating expenses for corporate and support, interest, net, and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 4,462 $ 5,455 Walmart International 772 1,194 Sam's Club 460 575 Corporate and support ( 376 ) ( 315 ) Operating income 5,318 6,909 Interest, net 419 536 Other (gains) and losses 1,998 2,529 Income before income taxes $ 2,901 $ 3,844 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category. When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club. (Amounts in millions) Three Months Ended April 30, Walmart U.S. net sales by merchandise category 2022 2021 Grocery $ 56,764 $ 51,391 General merchandise 27,379 30,607 Health and wellness 10,894 9,970 Other categories 1,867 1,199 Total $ 96,904 $ 93,167 Of Walmart U.S.'s total net sales, approximately $ 11.4 billion and $ 11.3 billion related to eCommerce for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023"") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three months ended April 30, 2022, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2022, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2022. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, supply chain disruptions, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "" Item 5. Other Information ."" 15 Table of Contents We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the duration and extent of economic stimulus measures; the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatment; pressure from inflation; supply chain disruptions; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, were as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 4.0 % 5.3 % 0.6 % 0.2 % Sam's Club 17.4 % 10.1 % 6.9 % 3.9 % Total U.S. 6.0 % 6.0 % 1.6 % 0.8 % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 6.0% for the three months ended April 30, 2022 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 4.0% for the three months ended April 30, 2022 driven by growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, while transactions were relatively flat. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales grew at a slower rate than total comparable sales which negatively contributed approximately 0.4% to comparable sales for the three months ended April 30, 2022. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment increased 17.4% for the three months ended April 30, 2022. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.5% to comparable sales for the three months ended April 30, 2022. 16 Table of Contents Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory, and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net sales $ 140,288 $ 137,159 Percentage change from comparable period 2.3 % 2.6 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 29,404 $ 28,129 Percentage change from comparable period 4.5 % 2.8 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.0 % 20.5 % Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 45 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2022, primarily driven by increased wage costs in the Walmart U.S. segment, partially offset by net sales growth. Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As such, we are allocating more capital to supply chain, customer-facing initiatives, technology and store remodels, and less to new store and club openings. The following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Three Months Ended April 30, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2022 2021 Supply chain, customer-facing initiatives and technology $ 2,063 $ 1,013 Store and club remodels 981 613 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 11 38 Total U.S. 3,055 1,664 Walmart International 484 550 Total Capital Expenditures $ 3,539 $ 2,214 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.5% and 5.3% for the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in net income. ROI was 13.9% and 14.4% for the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to the increase in average total assets driven by higher inventories. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. 17 Table of Contents Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 13,232 $ 12,443 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 241,362 $ 234,737 Return on assets (ROA) 5.5 % 5.3 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 24,351 $ 24,233 + Interest income 163 108 + Depreciation and amortization 10,679 11,022 + Rent 2,270 2,534 = ROI operating income $ 37,463 $ 37,897 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 241,362 $ 234,737 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 100,315 95,424 ' - Average accounts payable (1) 50,539 46,124 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 21,216 20,874 = Average invested capital $ 269,922 $ 263,163 Return on investment (ROI) 13.9 % 14.4 % (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2.

Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash used in or provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash used in operating activities was $3.8 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2022, which represents a decline of $6.6 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline is primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales, lower operating income and the timing of certain payments and payables. Free cash flow for the three months ended April 30, 2022 was negative $7.3 billion, which represents a decline of $7.9 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in free cash flow is due to the reduction in operating cash flows described above, as well as an increase of $1.3 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (3,758) $ 2,858 Payments for property and equipment (3,539) (2,214) Free cash flow $ (7,297) $ 644 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1) $ (4,558) $ 5,850 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 5,315 (5,399) (1) ""Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 19 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 Total revenues $ 141,569 $ 138,310 Percentage change from comparable period 2.4% 2.7% Net sales $ 140,288 $ 137,159 Percentage change from comparable period 2.3% 2.6% Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 6.0% 6.0% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 23.8% 24.7% Operating income $ 5,318 $ 6,909 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.8% 5.0% Other (gains) and losses $ 1,998 $ 2,529 Consolidated net income $ 2,103 $ 2,811 Unit counts at period end 10,585 10,526 Retail square feet at period end 1,059 1,065 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $3.3 billion or 2.4% for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in revenue was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which was impacted by higher inflation, along with positive comparable sales in each of our international markets. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a $5.0 billion decrease related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter fiscal 2022. Net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2022 included a $0.4 billion negative impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") decreased 87 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year driven by higher supply chain costs, product and fuel mix, and inflation. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 45 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2022, primarily driven by increased wage costs in the Walmart U.S. segment, partially offset by net sales growth. Other gains and losses for the three months ended April 30, 2022 consisted of a net loss of $2.0 billion primarily associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments. For the three months ended April 30, 2021, other gains and losses consisted of a net loss of $2.5 billion, which primarily reflects $2.1 billion in net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, as well as $0.4 billion in incremental losses associated with the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan upon closing of the transactions during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Our effective income tax rate was 27.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2022, compared to 26.9% for the same period in the previous fiscal year. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income decreased $0.7 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $0.74 for the three months ended April 30, 2022, which represents a decrease of $0.23 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 Net sales $ 96,904 $ 93,167 Percentage change from comparable period 4.0 % 5.0 % Calendar comparable sales increase 4.0 % 5.3 % Operating income $ 4,462 $ 5,455 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.6 % 5.9 % Unit counts at period end 4,735 4,743 Retail square feet at period end 702 703 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $3.7 billion or 4.0% for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was due to comparable sales of 4.0% for the three months ended April 30, 2022, driven by growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and some higher inflation 20 Table of Contents impacts in certain merchandise categories, while transactions were relatively flat. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales grew at a slower rate than total comparable sales which negatively contributed approximately 0.4% to comparable sales for the three months ended April 30, 2022. Gross profit rate decreased 38 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by increased supply chain costs and product mix shifts into lower margin categories, partially offset by price management impacts driven by higher cost inflation. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 95 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by increased wage costs, partially offset by strong sales growth and $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 costs. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $1.0 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 Net sales $ 23,763 $ 27,300 Percentage change from comparable period (13.0) % (8.3) % Operating income $ 772 $ 1,194 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.2 % 4.4 % Unit counts at period end 5,250 5,184 Retail square feet at period end 277 282 Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $3.5 billion or 13.0% for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The reduction in net sales was due to a $5.0 billion decrease related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, partially offset by positive comparables sales in each of our remaining markets. Net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2022 included negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $0.4 billion. Gross profit rate decreased 108 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by higher markdowns and shifts into lower margin formats and channels in China, as well as the impact related to our divested markets. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 12 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, due to impacts from the divested markets. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $0.4 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2022 2021 Including Fuel Net sales $ 19,621 $ 16,692 Percentage change from comparable period 17.5 % 10.1 % Calendar comparable sales increase 17.4 % 10.1 % Operating income $ 460 $ 575 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.3 % 3.4 % Unit counts at period end 600 599 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 16,532 $ 14,937 Percentage change from comparable period 10.7 % 6.2 % Operating income $ 335 $ 530 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.0 % 3.5 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $2.9 billion or 17.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 17.4% for the three months ended April 30, 2022. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and 21 Table of Contents average ticket and included some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. Sam's Club eCommerce net sales positively contributed approximately 0.5% to comparable sales for the three months ended April 30, 2022. Gross profit rate decreased 216 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The gross profit rate was negatively impacted by higher supply chain costs, elevated inflation and markdowns caused by inventory delays. Membership and other income increased 11.9% for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was due to increases in new member sign-ups and Plus penetration. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 117 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by higher sales. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $115 million for the three months ended April 30, 2022, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by or Used in Operating Activities Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (3,758) $ 2,858 Net cash used in operating activities was $3.8 billion as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.9 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decline is primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales, lower operating income and the timing of certain payments and payables. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $11.8 billion and $22.8 billion at April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our working capital deficit was $13.3 billion as of April 30, 2022, which increased when compared to $4.3 billion as of April 30, 2021, primarily driven by an increase in short-term borrowings and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by the increase in inventory described above. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of April 30, 2022 and January 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents of $3.3 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $3.3 billion at April 30, 2022, approximately $1.5 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized by Flipkart. Net Cash Provided by or Used In Investing Activities Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (4,558) $ 5,850 Net cash used in investing activities was $4.6 billion as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $5.9 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities increased $10.4 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2022 primarily as a result of lapping the net proceeds received from the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan and an increase in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. 22 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by or Used in Financing Activities Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 5,315 $ (5,399) Net cash from financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $5.3 billion as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $5.4 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to an increase in short-term borrowings to fund working capital needs. In April 2022, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at April 30, 2022, all undrawn. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the three months ended April 30, 2022: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2022 $ 2,803 $ 34,864 $ 37,667 Repayments of long-term debt (926) — (926) Reclassifications of long-term debt 1,750 (1,750) — Other (47) (940) (987) Balances as of April 30, 2022 $ 3,580 $ 32,174 $ 35,754 Dividends Effective February 17, 2022, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2022 annual dividend of $2.20 per share. For fiscal 2023, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.56 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 18, 2022 April 4, 2022 May 6, 2022 May 31, 2022 August 12, 2022 September 6, 2022 December 9, 2022 January 3, 2023 The dividend installments payable on April 4, 2022 and May 31, 2022 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended April 30, 2022 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in February 2021, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of April 30, 2022, authorization for $8.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the three months ended April 30, 2022 and 2021: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 Total number of shares repurchased 16.9 20.6 Average price paid per share $ 142.17 $ 136.18 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 2,408 $ 2,809 23 Table of Contents Material Cash Requirements Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. Capital Resources We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of April 30, 2022, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. As of April 30, 2022, there were no material changes to our market risks disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on March 18, 2022, under the caption "" Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 24 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 25 Table of Contents PART II.

We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,150 cases as of May 20, 2022. The liability phase of a trial in one of the MDL cases began on October 4, 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims. On November 23, 2021, the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the trial, which will determine amounts owed by the defendants, began on May 10, 2022 and ended on May 17, 2022, and the parties will await a ruling from the court. The Company intends to appeal the jury verdict from the liability phase upon completion of the abatement phase of the trial. In addition, there are over 240 state court cases pending as of May 20, 2022. This includes certain cases that were remanded by the MDL court and a case brought by the Cherokee Nation that was remanded by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma to the District Court of Sequoya County, Oklahoma. The case citations for the state court cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA"") related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al ., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. The DOJ filed its opposition brief on April 23, 2021 and the Company filed its reply brief on May 24, 2021. On November 19, 2021, the District Court stayed further proceedings in the DOJ complaint pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in two other cases interpreting the CSA, which have been consolidated into Ruan v. United States , 142 S. Ct. 457 (2021). Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other Opioids litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in the Chancery Court in Delaware. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, were purportedly filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016, through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021; the lead plaintiff responded to the motion on January 10, 2022; and the defendants filed their reply brief on February 10, 2022. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in Delaware Chancery Court filed the opening brief on their motion to dismiss that case on December 21, 2021; and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 27, 2022, the defendants filed their opening brief in support of their motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v. McMillon et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 4/16/21: Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund et al. v. Walton et al., DE Court of Chancery, 9/27/21. Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al. , USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and Martin v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC , Dist. of DE, 3/5/21, consolidated into In re Walmart Inc. Securities Litigation , USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21. 26 Table of Contents II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS ASDA Equal Value Claims : Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal). Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (""Flipkart""), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the ""Rules"") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, or whether the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million. In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The Company believes the suit is without merit and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. 27 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption ""Risk Factors,"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended April 30, 2022 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in February 2021, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of April 30, 2022, authorization for $8.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended April 30, 2022, was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) February 1 - 28, 2022 6,677,564 $ 136.63 6,677,564 $ 9.7 March 1 - 31, 2022 6,641,000 142.14 6,641,000 8.8 April 1 - 30, 2022 3,341,798 155.50 3,341,798 8.3 Total 16,660,362 16,660,362 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of October 2021 related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Use of Estimates The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Investments Investments in equity and debt securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value of equity securities measured on a recurring basis are recognized in other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 5 for details. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost and are adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments in debt securities classified as trading are reported at fair value with interest income recorded in interest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As of October 31, 2021, the Company had $ 1.0 billion in debt securities classified as trading. Indemnification Liabilities The Company has provided certain indemnifications in connection with its divestitures and has recorded indemnification liabilities equal to the estimated fair value of the obligations upon inception. As of October 31, 2021 and January 31, 2021, the Company had $ 0.8 billion and $ 0.6 billion, respectively, of certain legal and tax indemnification liabilities recorded within deferred income taxes and other in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these indemnities was $ 3.5 billion, based on exchange rates as of October 31, 2021. 9 Table of Contents Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021 and 2020.

The Company recorded a $ 2.4 billion loss on extinguishment of debt during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, which included payment of $ 2.3 billion in early extinguishment premiums. Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. 11 Table of Contents As described in Note 1 , the Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments on a recurring basis in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the Company's equity investments measured on a recurring basis is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of October 31, 2021 Fair Value as of January 31, 2021 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 6,124 $ 6,517 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 6,340 7,905 Total $ 12,464 $ 14,422 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of October 31, 2021 and January 31, 2021, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: October 31, 2021 January 31, 2021 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 4,719 $ 91 (1) $ 3,250 $ 166 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges — — 1,250 311 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 8,086 ( 881 ) (2) 5,073 ( 394 ) (2) Total $ 12,805 $ ( 790 ) $ 9,573 $ 83 (1) Classified primarily in other long-term assets within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Classified primarily in deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. As of January 31, 2021, the Company's operations in the U.K. (""Asda"") and operations in Japan (""Seiyu"") met the held for sale criteria, and as a result the Company recorded non-recurring impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as the carrying value of the disposal groups exceeded their fair value, less costs to sell. Upon completing the sales of Asda in February 2021 and Seiyu in March 2021, the Company recorded incremental non-recurring impairment charges of $ 0.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 6 . The Company did not have other material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of October 31, 2021. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of October 31, 2021 and January 31, 2021, are as follows: October 31, 2021 January 31, 2021 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 38,000 $ 44,354 $ 44,309 $ 54,240 Note 6. Divestitures During fiscal 2022, the Company completed the following transactions related to the Company's Walmart International segment. After closing these transactions, total assets of the Walmart International segment were $ 94.8 billion as of October 31, 2021, as compared to $ 109.4 billion as of January 31, 2021. Asda In February 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Asda, the Company's retail operations in the U.K., for net consideration of $ 9.6 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $ 0.2 billion 12 Table of Contents in other gains and losses in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Asda and recognized its retained investment in Asda as a debt security within other long-term assets and also recognized certain legal and tax indemnity liabilities within deferred income taxes and other on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Seiyu In March 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Seiyu, the Company's retail operations in Japan, for net consideration of $ 1.2 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $ 0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Seiyu and recognized its retained 15 percent ownership interest in Seiyu as an equity investment within other long-term assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 7. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Opioids Litigation In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL"") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. The liability phase of a trial in one of the MDL cases began on October 4, 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims. On November 23, 2021, the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The Company intends to appeal this verdict. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA""). The Company’s action was dismissed. The Company has appealed this decision to the Fifth Circuit and awaits the court's decision. On December 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the CSA. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. The DOJ filed its opposition brief on April 23, 2021 and the Company filed its reply brief on May 24, 2021. On November 19, 2021, the District Court stayed further proceedings in the DOJ complaint pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in two consolidated cases (not involving Walmart) interpreting the CSA. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 13 Table of Contents through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action. Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. On September 27, 2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the current Board and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from the various Opioids Litigation and intends to vigorously defend these litigation matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Asda Equal Value Claims Prior to the divestiture of Asda, the Company, through its Asda subsidiary, was a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees (the ""Asda Equal Value Claims""), and further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company will continue to conduct the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters. Note 8. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale, eCommerce websites and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment significantly changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 96,609 $ 88,353 $ 287,968 $ 270,378 Walmart International 23,627 29,554 73,962 86,487 Sam's Club 18,971 15,845 54,307 47,383 Net sales $ 139,207 $ 133,752 $ 416,237 $ 404,248 Operating income by segment, as well as operating loss for corporate and support, interest, net, loss on extinguishment of debt and other gains and losses are as follows: 14 Table of Contents Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 4,860 $ 4,589 $ 16,404 $ 13,948 Walmart International 871 1,078 2,926 2,696 Sam's Club 475 431 1,710 1,517 Corporate and support ( 414 ) ( 320 ) ( 985 ) ( 1,100 ) Operating income 5,792 5,778 20,055 17,061 Interest, net 442 516 1,456 1,700 Loss on extinguishment of debt 2,410 — 2,410 — Other (gains) and losses ( 1,207 ) ( 1,853 ) 2,275 ( 5,796 ) Income before income taxes $ 4,147 $ 7,115 $ 13,914 $ 21,157 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category. When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022"") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2021, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2021. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Consistent with our strategy to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, we completed the following actions during the nine months ended October 31, 2021: • Completed the sale of Asda, our retail business in the U.K., for net consideration of $9.6 billion in February 2021. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we recognized an incremental non-cash loss of $0.2 billion, after tax, primarily due to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. • Completed the sale of Seiyu, our retail business in Japan, for net consideration of $1.2 billion in March 2021. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we recognized an incremental non-cash loss of $0.2 billion, after tax, primarily due to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. 16 Table of Contents We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, supply chain disruptions, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "" Item 5. Other Information ."" We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID–19 pandemic; the duration and extent of economic stimulus measures; timing and effectiveness of global vaccines, as well as potential impacts of any related vaccine mandates on our workforce; supply chain disruptions; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, were as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 9.4 % 6.6 % 0.4 % (0.1) % 6.7 % 8.9 % 0.4 % (0.2) % Sam's Club 19.6 % 8.3 % 5.9 % (3.3) % 14.6 % 8.9 % 5.4 % (3.8) % Total U.S. 11.0 % 6.8 % 1.3 % (0.6) % 7.9 % 8.9 % 1.2 % (0.7) % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 11.0% and 7.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 9.4% and 6.7% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, driven by growth in transactions and average ticket, which includes strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, average ticket increased while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips and purchased larger baskets. Transaction growth turned positive in April 2021 and continued with strong growth through the second and third quarters of fiscal 2022 as customers' pre-pandemic behaviors largely resumed. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales grew at a slower rate than total comparable sales which negatively contributed approximately 0.1% to comparable sales for the three months ended October 31, 17 Table of Contents 2021 as customers shifted toward more in-store shopping as compared to the same period in the previous year. For the nine months ended October 31, 2021, eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales, primarily driven by store pick-up and delivery. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment increased 19.6% and 14.6% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and was aided by consumer spending due to government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.1% and 1.7% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively. Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory, and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net sales $ 139,207 $ 133,752 $ 416,237 $ 404,248 Percentage change from comparable period 4.1 % 5.3 % 3.0 % 6.6 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 29,710 $ 28,591 $ 86,350 $ 84,957 Percentage change from comparable period 3.9 % 4.4 % 1.6 % 5.9 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.3 % 21.4 % 20.7 % 21.0 % Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat for the three months ended October 31, 2021, which benefited from growth in net sales and $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs as compared to the same period in the prior year, offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 27 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2021, primarily driven by net sales growth and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $2.0 billion as compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment. Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As such, we are allocating more capital to supply chain, customer-facing initiatives, technology and store remodels, and less to new store and club openings. The following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Nine Months Ended October 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2021 2020 Supply chain, customer-facing initiatives and technology $ 4,408 $ 3,316 Store and club remodels 2,375 1,531 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 112 64 Total U.S. 6,895 4,911 Walmart International 1,693 1,527 Total Capital Expenditures $ 8,588 $ 6,438 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 3.3% and 8.2% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to net fair value changes in our equity instruments as well as the losses on divestiture of our operations in the 18 Table of Contents U.K. and Japan, partially offset by the increase in operating income. ROI was 14.5% and 13.7% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2021 and 2020. The increase in ROI was primarily due to the increase in operating income. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 8,299 $ 20,008 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 247,857 $ 245,347 Return on assets (ROA) 3.3 % 8.2 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 25,542 $ 22,383 + Interest income 141 132 + Depreciation and amortization 10,771 11,161 + Rent 2,360 2,646 = ROI operating income $ 38,814 $ 36,322 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 247,857 $ 245,347 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 99,872 95,637 ' - Average accounts payable (1) 55,654 51,951 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 24,735 22,984 = Average invested capital $ 267,340 $ 266,049 Return on investment (ROI) 14.5 % 13.7 % (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2.

Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $16.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2021, which decreased when compared to $22.9 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in inventory purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. We generated free cash flow of $7.7 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2021, which decreased when compared to $16.4 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 due to the same reasons as the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $2.2 billion in increased capital expenditures. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 16,291 $ 22,880 Payments for property and equipment (8,588) (6,438) Free cash flow $ 7,703 $ 16,442 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (1,530) $ (6,507) Net cash used in financing activities (18,113) (11,340) (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Total revenues $ 140,525 $ 134,708 $ 419,883 $ 407,072 Percentage change from comparable period 4.3% 5.2% 3.1 % 6.5% Net sales $ 139,207 $ 133,752 $ 416,237 $ 404,248 Percentage change from comparable period 4.1% 5.3% 3.0 % 6.6% Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 11.0% 6.8% 7.9 % 8.9% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 24.6% 25.0% 24.7 % 24.5% Operating income $ 5,792 $ 5,778 $ 20,055 $ 17,061 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.2% 4.3% 4.8 % 4.2% Loss on extinguishment of debt $ 2,410 $ — $ 2,410 $ — Other (gains) and losses $ (1,207) $ (1,853) $ 2,275 $ (5,796) Consolidated net income $ 3,132 $ 5,201 $ 10,307 $ 15,714 Unit counts at period end 10,566 11,510 10,566 11,510 Retail square feet at period end 1,065 1,128 1,065 1,128 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $5.8 billion or 4.3% and $12.8 billion or 3.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases in revenues were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which benefited from strong U.S. consumer spending and some inflation, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our remaining international markets. These increases were partially offset by net sales decreases of $9.4 billion and $22.4 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in February 2021 and March 2021, respectively. Net sales also benefited from a $1.3 billion and $4.7 billion positive impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") decreased 42 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to higher supply chain costs and fuel mix in the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments. These decreases were partially offset by benefits in the Walmart U.S. segment related to lower markdowns, price management, and growth in our advertising business. Gross profit rate increased 15 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease for the three months ended October 31, 2021 was more than offset by increases in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily driven by mix shifts into general merchandise in the Walmart U.S. segment, due in part to government stimulus spending, lower markdowns and lapping last year's COVID-19 related mix shifts into lower margin categories such as food and consumables. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat for the three months ended October 31, 2021, which benefited from growth in net sales and $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs as compared to the same period in the prior year, offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 27 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2021, primarily driven by net sales growth and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $2.0 billion as compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $2.4 billion for both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, due to the early retirement of certain higher rate long-term debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. Other gains and losses for the three months ended October 31, 2021 consisted of a net gain of $1.2 billion primarily associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments. Other gains and losses for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 consisted of a net loss of $2.3 billion which primarily reflects $1.8 billion in net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, as well as $0.4 billion in incremental losses associated with the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan upon closing of the transactions during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, other gains and losses consisted of a net gain of $1.9 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively, primarily representing the fair value changes of our equity investments and the loss on sale of Walmart Argentina. Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% and 25.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, compared to 26.9% and 25.7% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decrease in effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2021 is primarily due to the loss on sale of Walmart Argentina recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, as it provided minimal realizable tax benefit. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, 21 Table of Contents outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income decreased $2.1 billion and $5.4 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021 respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $1.11 and $3.59 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, which represents respective decreases of $0.69 and $1.89, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net sales $ 96,609 $ 88,353 $ 287,968 $ 270,378 Percentage change from comparable period 9.3 % 6.2 % 6.5 % 8.7 % Calendar comparable sales increase 9.4 % 6.6 % 6.7 % 8.9 % Operating income $ 4,860 $ 4,589 $ 16,404 $ 13,948 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.0 % 5.2 % 5.7 % 5.2 % Unit counts at period end 4,742 4,748 4,742 4,748 Retail square feet at period end 703 703 703 703 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $8.3 billion or 9.3% and $17.6 billion or 6.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to comparable sales of 9.4% and 6.7% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, driven by growth in transactions and average ticket, which includes strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, average ticket increased while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips and purchased larger baskets. Transaction growth turned positive in April 2021 and continued with strong growth through the second and third quarters of fiscal 2022 as customers' pre-pandemic behaviors largely resumed. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales grew at a slower rate than total comparable sales which negatively contributed approximately 0.1% to comparable sales for the three months ended October 31, 2021 as customers shifted toward more in-store shopping as compared to the same period in the previous year. For the nine months ended, eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales, primarily driven by store pick-up and delivery. Gross profit rate decreased 12 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by higher supply chain costs and fuel mix, partially offset by lower markdowns, price management, and growth in our advertising business. For the nine months ended October 31, 2021, gross profit rate increased 50 basis points due primarily to shifts into general merchandise due in part to government stimulus spending and lapping last year's COVID-related mix shifts into food and consumables in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Gross profit rate was also impacted by lower markdowns, lapping the temporary closures of our Auto Care Centers and Vision centers, price management, and growth in our advertising business, partially offset by increased supply chain costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by increased wage investments, partially offset by strong sales growth and $0.1 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were relatively flat for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, which benefited from strong sales, lower incremental COVID-19 costs of $1.5 billion and lapping a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, partially offset by increased investments in wages. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.3 billion and $2.5 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net sales $ 23,627 $ 29,554 $ 73,962 $ 86,487 Percentage change from comparable period (20.1) % 1.3 % (14.5) % (0.7) % Operating income $ 871 $ 1,078 $ 2,926 $ 2,696 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.7 % 3.6 % 4.0 % 3.1 % Unit counts at period end 5,224 6,163 5,224 6,163 Retail square feet at period end 282 345 282 345 22 Table of Contents Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $5.9 billion or 20.1% and $12.5 billion or 14.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The reduction in net sales was due to decreases of $9.4 billion and $22.4 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, primarily related to the divestiture of Asda and Seiyu during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The decreases were partially offset by positive net sales growth in the majority of our remaining markets. Net sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021 included positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $1.3 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. Gross profit rate decreased 86 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats. The divested markets also negatively impacted our gross profit rate. Gross profit rate decreased 38 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats and the decrease related to our divested markets, partially offset by benefits in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 related to mix shifts into higher margin categories and lower markdowns. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 and 62 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to lower incremental COVID-19 related costs and impacts from the divested markets. Additionally, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 benefited from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating income for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021 included positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $0.2 billion and increased $0.2 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Including Fuel Net sales $ 18,971 $ 15,845 $ 54,307 $ 47,383 Percentage change from comparable period 19.7 % 8.3 % 14.6 % 8.9 % Calendar comparable sales increase 19.6 % 8.3 % 14.6 % 8.9 % Operating income $ 475 $ 431 $ 1,710 $ 1,517 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.5 % 2.7 % 3.1 % 3.2 % Unit counts at period end 600 599 600 599 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 16,614 $ 14,596 $ 47,988 $ 43,929 Percentage change from comparable period 13.8 % 11.6 % 9.2 % 12.7 % Operating income $ 368 $ 358 $ 1,473 $ 1,283 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.2 % 2.5 % 3.1 % 2.9 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $3.1 billion or 19.7% and $6.9 billion or 14.6% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 19.6% and 14.6% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and was aided by consumer spending due to government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce net sales positively contributed approximately 1.1% and 1.7% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively. Gross profit rate decreased 127 and 75 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The gross profit rates were negatively impacted by higher supply chain costs, increased fuel sales which have lower margins, and cost inflation. The decrease in gross profit rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 was partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales. 23 Table of Contents Membership and other income increased 14.4% and 13.0% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to increases in overall renewal rates, new member sign-ups and Plus penetration. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 117 and 73 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases were primarily the result of higher fuel sales as well as a benefit from lower incremental COVID-19 related costs. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 was partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $44 million and $193 million for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. In the current environment, we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 16,291 $ 22,880 Net cash provided by operating activities was $16.3 billion and $22.9 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in inventory purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $16.1 billion and $14.3 billion at October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our working capital deficit was $4.7 billion as of October 31, 2021, which decreased when compared to $14.5 billion as of October 31, 2020, primarily driven by the increase in inventory described above. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of October 31, 2021 and January 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $5.5 billion at October 31, 2021, approximately $2.8 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,530) $ (6,507) Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion as compared to $6.5 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $5.0 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 primarily due to the net proceeds received from the divestitures of Asda and Seiyu, partially offset by increased capital expenditures. Growth activities For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022, we project capital expenditures will be approximately $13 billion, with a focus on supply chain, automation, customer-facing initiatives and technology. Refer to the "" Strat e gic Capital Allocation "" section in our Company Pe rformance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 and 2020. 24 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash used in financing activities $ (18,113) $ (11,340) Net cash from financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of the Company's common stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $18.1 billion as compared to $11.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and related payment of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes, as well as increased share repurchases, partially offset by new long-term debt issuances in the current year and equity funding from the sale of subsidiary stock. During the nine months ended October 31, 2021, the Company received $3.2 billion related to the sale of stock by certain of its subsidiaries, primarily related to a new equity funding which reduced the Company's ownership of its majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary from approximately 83% as of January 31, 2021, to approximately 75%. In April 2021, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at October 31, 2021, all undrawn. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the nine months ended October 31, 2021: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2021 $ 3,115 $ 41,194 $ 44,309 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 6,945 6,945 Repayments of long-term debt (3,010) (10,000) (13,010) Reclassifications of long-term debt 1,461 (1,461) — Other 9 (253) (244) Balances as of October 31, 2021 $ 1,575 $ 36,425 $ 38,000 Our total outstanding long-term debt decreased $6.3 billion during the nine months ended October 31, 2021, primarily due to the extinguishment and maturities of certain long-term debt, partially offset by the issuance of new long-term debt in September 2021. Refer to Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the maturities, extinguishment and issuances of long-term debt. The early extinguishment of certain long-term debt allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. In connection with this early extinguishment of debt, the Company paid premiums of $2.3 billion, which represents the majority of the $2.4 billion loss recorded on the transaction during the nine months ended October 31, 2021. Dividends Effective February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2022 annual dividend of $2.20 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2021 annual dividend of $2.16 per share. For fiscal 2022, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.55 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 19, 2021 April 5, 2021 May 7, 2021 June 1, 2021 August 13, 2021 September 7, 2021 December 10, 2021 January 3, 2022 The dividend installments payable on April 5, 2021, June 1, 2021 and September 7, 2021 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made prior to February 22, 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of October 31, 2021, authorization for $13.1 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. 25 Table of Contents We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the nine months ended October 31, 2021 and 2020: Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 Total number of shares repurchased 52.7 9.6 Average price paid per share $ 139.76 $ 123.54 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 7,368 $ 1,186 Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal increases in merchandise inventories, our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in the capital markets. We also have $15.0 billion in various committed lines of credit in the U.S., all of which currently remains undrawn. At October 31, 2021, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. As of October 31, 2021, there were no material changes to our market risks disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on March 19, 2021, under the caption "" Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 27 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption ""Item 1. Financial Statements,"" in Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings."" We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,100 cases as of November 22, 2021, some of which cases are in the process of being transferred to the MDL or have remand motions pending. The liability phase of a trial in one of the MDL cases began on October 4, 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims. On November 23, 2021, the jury found in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The Company intends to appeal this verdict. There is one case in which the Company is named as a defendant that was remanded from the MDL court to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, where trial is currently scheduled to begin in September 2022. In addition, there are over 200 state court cases pending as of November 22, 2021, some of which may be removed to federal court to seek MDL transfer. The case citations for the state court cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA""). The Company’s action, Walmart Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice et al., USDC, Eastern Dist. of Texas, 10/22/20, was dismissed. The Company has appealed this decision to the Fifth Circuit and awaits the court's decision. A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the DOJ against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the CSA related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et a l., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. The DOJ filed its opposition brief on April 23, 2021 and the Company filed its reply brief on May 24, 2021. On November 19, 2021, the District Court stayed further proceedings in the DOJ complaint pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in two other cases interpreting the CSA, which have been consolidated into Ruan v. United States , __, S. Ct. __,2021 WL 5148067 (U.S. Nov. 5, 2021) (mem.). Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class action lawsuits drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming various current and former directors and certain officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution; and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company’s disclosures with respect to opioids, were purportedly filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the court consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021. Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v. McMillon et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 4/16/21: Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund et al. v. Walton et al., DE Court of Chancery, 9/27/21 . Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and Martin v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC , Dist. of DE, 3/5/21, consolidated into In re Walmart Inc. Securities Litigation , USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21. 28 Table of Contents II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS ASDA Equal Value Claims : Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); and ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal). Money Transfer Agent Services Proceedings: The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company’s consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company’s money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas and is cooperating with the government’s investigation. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the ""FTC"") and is cooperating with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. While the Company had been engaged in discussions with the FTC regarding a potential resolution of this matter, the parties have not been able to reach a resolution. The FTC staff recently forwarded a draft civil complaint to the FTC seeking authority to file a complaint against the Company seeking various forms of monetary and injunctive relief. The FTC is currently considering whether to grant such authorization. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of the investigations, any discussions, or any related actions by the governmental entities regarding these matters. While the Company does not currently believe that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and final outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (""Flipkart""), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the ""Rules"") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, or whether the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold of $1 million. In June 2021, the Company signed a tolling agreement with the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California to toll the statute of limitations for potential claims regarding Walmart’s management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The Company is presently engaged in settlement discussions. It is not presently known whether a settlement will be reached or enforcement action will ensue, but the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. The Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 29 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption ""Risk Factors,"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made prior to February 22, 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of October 31, 2021, authorization for $13.1 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended October 31, 2021, was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) August 1 - 31, 2021 4,470,493 $ 147.73 4,470,493 $ 14.6 September 1 - 30, 2021 4,988,810 144.55 4,988,810 13.9 October 1 - 31, 2021 5,315,215 141.62 5,315,215 13.1 Total 14,774,518 14,774,518 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag based on a calendar year. In July 2021, the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary completed a $ 3.6 billion new equity funding, a portion of which was contributed by the Company. This transaction reduced the Company's ownership of Flipkart to approximately 75 % in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Use of Estimates The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Investments Investments in equity and debt securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value of equity securities measured on a recurring basis are recognized in other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 5 for details. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost and are adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments in debt securities classified as trading are reported at fair value with interest income recorded in interest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As of July 31, 2021, the Company had $ 1.0 billion in debt securities classified as trading. Indemnification Liabilities The Company has provided certain indemnifications in connection with its divestitures and has recorded indemnification liabilities equal to the estimated fair value of the obligations upon inception. As of July 31, 2021 and January 31, 2021, the Company had $ 0.8 billion and $ 0.6 billion, respectively, of certain legal and tax indemnification liabilities recorded within deferred income taxes and other in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these indemnities was $ 3.6 billion, based on exchange rates as of July 31, 2021. 8 Table of Contents Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021 and 2020. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 4,364 $ 6,439 $ 7,175 $ 10,513 Consolidated net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 88 ) 37 ( 169 ) ( 47 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 4,276 $ 6,476 $ 7,006 $ 10,466 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,799 2,832 2,807 2,832 Dilutive impact of share-based awards 13 16 13 16 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,812 2,848 2,820 2,848 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 1.53 $ 2.29 $ 2.50 $ 3.70 Diluted 1.52 2.27 2.48 3.67 Note 3. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for derivative instruments are generally recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation and any related net investment hedge impacts resulting from a disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The following tables provide the changes in the composition of total accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and July 31, 2021, respectively, as well as for the three months ended April 30, 2020 and July 31, 2020, respectively: (Amounts in millions and net of immaterial income taxes) Currency Translation and Other Net Investment Hedges Cash Flow Hedges Minimum Pension Liability Total Balances as of February 1, 2021 $ ( 10,772 ) $ 1,296 $ ( 304 ) $ ( 1,986 ) $ ( 11,766 ) Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications, net ( 225 ) ( 7 ) ( 26 ) ( 1 ) ( 259 ) Reclassifications related to business dispositions, net (1) 3,258 ( 1,195 ) 30 1,966 4,059 Reclassifications to income, net — — 16 4 20 Balances as of April 30, 2021 $ ( 7,739 ) $ 94 $ ( 284 ) $ ( 17 ) $ ( 7,946 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net 123 — ( 193 ) ( 3 ) ( 73 ) Reclassifications to income, net — — 38 5 43 Balances as of July 31, 2021 $ ( 7,616 ) $ 94 $ ( 439 ) $ ( 15 ) $ ( 7,976 ) (1) Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss, the majority of which was considered in the impairment evaluation when the individual disposal groups met the held for sale classification in fiscal 2021.

Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program. In April 2021, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364 -day revolving credit facility of $ 10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $ 5.0 billion. In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15.0 billion at July 31, 2021 and January 31, 2021, all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the six months ended July 31, 2021: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2021 $ 3,115 $ 41,194 $ 44,309 Repayments of long-term debt ( 3,010 ) — ( 3,010 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 1,511 ( 1,511 ) — Other 1 ( 102 ) ( 101 ) Balances as of July 31, 2021 $ 1,617 $ 39,581 $ 41,198 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. As described in Note 1 , the Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments on a recurring basis in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the Company's equity investments measured on a recurring basis is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of July 31, 2021 Fair Value as of January 31, 2021 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 5,567 $ 6,517 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 5,730 7,905 Total $ 11,297 $ 14,422 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of July 31, 2021 and January 31, 2021, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: July 31, 2021 January 31, 2021 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 3,250 $ 133 (1) $ 3,250 $ 166 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges — — 1,250 311 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 8,243 ( 616 ) (2) 5,073 ( 394 ) (2) Total $ 11,493 $ ( 483 ) $ 9,573 $ 83 (1) Classified in other long-term assets within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Classified primarily in deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. 10 Table of Contents As of January 31, 2021, the Company's operations in the U.K. (""Asda"") and operations in Japan (""Seiyu"") met the held for sale criteria, and as a result the Company recorded non-recurring impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as the carrying value of the disposal groups exceeded their fair value, less costs to sell. Upon completing the sales of Asda in February 2021 and Seiyu in March 2021, the Company recorded incremental non-recurring impairment charges of $ 0.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 6 . The Company did not have other material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of July 31, 2021. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of July 31, 2021 and January 31, 2021, are as follows: July 31, 2021 January 31, 2021 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 41,198 $ 50,373 $ 44,309 $ 54,240 Note 6. Divestitures During fiscal 2022, the Company completed the following transactions related to the Company's Walmart International segment. After closing these transactions, total assets of the Walmart International segment were $ 87.8 billion as of July 31, 2021, as compared to $ 109.4 billion as of January 31, 2021. Asda In February 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Asda, the Company's retail operations in the U.K., for net consideration of $ 9.6 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $ 0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Asda and recognized its retained investment in Asda as a debt security within other long-term assets and also recognized certain legal and tax indemnity liabilities within deferred income taxes and other on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Seiyu In March 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Seiyu, the Company's retail operations in Japan, for net consideration of $ 1.2 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $ 0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Seiyu and recognized its retained 15 percent ownership interest in Seiyu as an equity investment within other long-term assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 7. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 11 Table of Contents Opioids Litigation In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA""). The Company’s action was dismissed. The Company has appealed this decision to the fifth circuit and awaits the court's decision. On December 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the CSA. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. The DOJ filed its opposition brief on April 23, 2021 and the Company filed its reply brief on May 24, 2021. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from the various Opioids Litigation and intends to vigorously defend these litigation matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Asda Equal Value Claims Prior to the divestiture of Asda, the Company, through its Asda subsidiary, was a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees (the ""Asda Equal Value Claims""), and further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company will continue to conduct the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters. Note 8. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale, eCommerce websites and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. 12 Table of Contents The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 98,192 $ 93,282 $ 191,359 $ 182,025 Walmart International 23,035 27,167 50,335 56,933 Sam's Club 18,644 16,375 35,336 31,538 Net sales $ 139,871 $ 136,824 $ 277,030 $ 270,496 Operating income by segment, as well as operating loss for corporate and support, interest, net and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 6,089 $ 5,057 $ 11,544 $ 9,359 Walmart International 861 812 2,055 1,618 Sam's Club 660 592 1,235 1,086 Corporate and support ( 256 ) ( 402 ) ( 571 ) ( 780 ) Operating income 7,354 6,059 14,263 11,283 Interest, net 478 635 1,014 1,184 Other (gains) and losses 953 ( 3,222 ) 3,482 ( 3,943 ) Income before income taxes $ 5,923 $ 8,646 $ 9,767 $ 14,042 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category. When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022"") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2021, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2021. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Consistent with our strategy to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, we completed the following actions during the six months ended July 31, 2021: • Completed the sale of Asda, our retail business in the U.K., for net consideration of $9.6 billion in February 2021. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we recognized an incremental non-cash loss of $0.2 billion, after tax, primarily due to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. • Completed the sale of Seiyu, our retail business in Japan, for net consideration of $1.2 billion in March 2021. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we recognized an incremental non-cash loss of $0.2 billion, after tax, primarily due to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. 15 Table of Contents We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "" Item 5. Other Information ."" We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID–19 pandemic; the duration and extent of economic stimulus; timing and effectiveness of global vaccines; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, were as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 5.4 % 9.7 % 0.4 % (0.2) % 5.4 % 10.1 % 0.4 % (0.3) % Sam's Club 13.9 % 8.8 % 6.2 % (4.7) % 12.0 % 9.2 % 5.0 % (4.0) % Total U.S. 6.7 % 9.6 % 1.3 % (0.8) % 6.4 % 10.0 % 1.1 % (0.7) % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 6.7% and 6.4% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 5.4% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, driven by growth in average ticket during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily aided by stimulus spending while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips and purchased larger baskets. Transaction growth turned positive in April 2021 and continued with strong growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as customers started to return to pre-pandemic behaviors, partially offset by a decline in average ticket through the second quarter. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.3% and 1.9% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, and was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment increased 13.9% and 12.0% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and was aided by stimulus 16 Table of Contents spending. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.1% and 1.9% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively. Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net sales $ 139,871 $ 136,824 $ 277,030 $ 270,496 Percentage change from comparable period 2.2 % 5.7 % 2.4 % 7.2 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 28,511 $ 28,994 $ 56,640 $ 56,366 Percentage change from comparable period (1.7) % 7.9 % 0.5 % 6.7 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 20.4 % 21.2 % 20.4 % 20.8 % Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 81 and 39 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. These decreases were primarily driven by growth in net sales, lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion as compared to the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, and lapping a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales also benefited from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These decreases were partially offset by increased wage investments in the Walmart U.S. segment. Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As such, we are allocating more capital to supply chain, customer-facing initiatives, technology and store remodels, and less to new store and club openings. The following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Six Months Ended July 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2021 2020 Supply chain, customer-facing initiatives and technology $ 2,454 $ 1,814 Store and club remodels 1,446 822 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 73 43 Total U.S. 3,973 2,679 Walmart International 1,046 890 Total Capital Expenditures $ 5,019 $ 3,569 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 4.4% and 7.7% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the losses on divestiture of our operations in the U.K., Japan and Argentina as well as net fair value changes in our equity instruments, partially offset by the increase in operating income. ROI was 14.8% and 13.5% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and 2020. The increase in ROI was primarily due to the increase in operating income. 17 Table of Contents We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 10,368 $ 18,128 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 237,967 $ 236,122 Return on assets (ROA) 4.4 % 7.7 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 25,528 $ 21,323 + Interest income 122 151 + Depreciation and amortization 10,892 11,113 + Rent 2,451 2,679 = ROI operating income $ 38,993 $ 35,266 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 237,967 $ 236,122 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 97,685 93,418 ' - Average accounts payable (1) 47,964 46,099 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 23,842 22,230 = Average invested capital $ 263,846 $ 261,211 Return on investment (ROI) 14.8 % 13.5 % (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2.

Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $12.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2021, which decreased when compared to $19.0 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in inventory purchases due in part to lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in the first half of fiscal 2021. We generated free cash flow of $7.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2021, which decreased when compared to $15.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 due to the same reasons as the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $1.5 billion in increased capital expenditures. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 12,423 $ 18,956 Payments for property and equipment (5,019) (3,569) Free cash flow $ 7,404 $ 15,387 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1) $ 2,402 $ (3,634) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (11,559) (7,814) (1) ""Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 19 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Total revenues $ 141,048 $ 137,742 $ 279,358 $ 272,364 Percentage change from comparable period 2.4% 5.6% 2.6 % 7.1% Net sales $ 139,871 $ 136,824 $ 277,030 $ 270,496 Percentage change from comparable period 2.2% 5.7% 2.4 % 7.2% Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 6.7% 9.6% 6.4 % 10.0% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 24.8% 24.9% 24.8 % 24.3% Operating income $ 7,354 $ 6,059 $ 14,263 $ 11,283 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.3% 4.4% 5.1 % 4.2% Other (gains) and losses $ 953 $ (3,222) $ 3,482 $ (3,943) Consolidated net income $ 4,364 $ 6,439 $ 7,175 $ 10,513 Unit counts at period end 10,524 11,496 10,524 11,496 Retail square feet at period end 1,063 1,127 1,063 1,127 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $3.3 billion or 2.4% and $7.0 billion or 2.6% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases in revenues were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which benefited from consumer stimulus dollars in the U.S., along with positive comparable sales in several of our remaining international markets. These increases were partially offset by net sales decreases of $8.9 billion and $13.1 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in February 2021 and March 2021, respectively. Net sales also benefited from a $2.4 billion and $3.3 billion positive impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") decreased 15 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to category mix shifts in the Sam's Club segment, increased supply chain costs in the Walmart U.S. segment and format mix shifts in the Walmart International segment. These decreases were partially offset by benefits in the Walmart U.S. segment related to administering COVID-19 vaccines, lapping the temporary COVID-19 related closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers in the previous year, lower markdowns and growth in our advertising business. Gross profit rate increased 43 basis points for the six months ended July 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease for the three months ended July 31, 2021 was more than offset by increases in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily driven by mix shifts into general merchandise in the Walmart U.S. segment, due in part to stimulus, lower markdowns and lapping last year's COVID-19 related mix shifts into lower margin categories such as food and consumables. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 81 and 39 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. These decreases were primarily driven by growth in net sales, lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion as compared to the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, respectively, and lapping a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales also benefited from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. These decreases were partially offset by increased wage investments in the Walmart U.S. segment. Other gains and losses for the three months ended July 31, 2021 consisted of a net loss of $1.0 billion which primarily reflects $0.9 billion in net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments. Other gains and losses for the six months ended July 31, 2021 consisted of a net loss of $3.5 billion which primarily reflects $3.0 billion in net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, as well as $0.4 billion in incremental losses associated with the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan upon closing of the transactions during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For the three and six months ended July 31, 2020, other gains and losses consisted of a gain of $3.2 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, primarily representing the fair value changes of our equity investments. Our effective income tax rate was 26.3% and 26.5% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, compared to 25.5% and 25.1% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. 20 Table of Contents As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income decreased $2.1 billion and $3.3 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021 respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $1.52 and $2.48 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, which represents respective decreases of $0.75 and $1.19, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net sales $ 98,192 $ 93,282 $ 191,359 $ 182,025 Percentage change from comparable period 5.3 % 9.5 % 5.1 % 10.0 % Calendar comparable sales increase 5.4 % 9.7 % 5.4 % 10.1 % Operating income $ 6,089 $ 5,057 $ 11,544 $ 9,359 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 6.2 % 5.4 % 6.0 % 5.1 % Unit counts at period end 4,740 4,754 4,740 4,754 Retail square feet at period end 703 703 703 703 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $4.9 billion or 5.3% and $9.3 billion or 5.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to comparable sales of 5.4% for both the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, driven by growth in average ticket during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily aided by stimulus spending while transactions decreased as customers consolidated shopping trips and purchased larger baskets. Transaction growth turned positive in April 2021 and continued with strong growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as customers started to return to pre-pandemic behaviors, partially offset by a decline in average ticket through the second quarter. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.3% and 1.9% to comparable sales during the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. Gross profit rate increased 20 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by a benefit from administering COVID-19 vaccines, lapping last year's temporary COVID-19 related closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers, lower markdowns and growth in our advertising business, partially offset by increased supply chain costs. For the six months ended July 31, 2021, gross profit rate increased 80 basis points due primarily to shifts into general merchandise due in part to stimulus and lapping last year's COVID-related mix shifts into food and consumables in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Gross profit rate was also impacted by lower markdowns, lapping the temporary closures of our Auto Care Centers and Vision centers, and a benefit from administering vaccines, partially offset by increased supply chain costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 49 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales, $1.0 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 costs and lapping a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. These decreases were partially offset by increased investments in wages, marketing, and technology. Despite the increase in net sales for the six months ended July 31, 2021, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were relatively flat when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to increased wage, technology and marketing investments in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2022, which were offset by $1.4 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs and lapping the business restructuring charge. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $1.0 billion and $2.2 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net sales $ 23,035 $ 27,167 $ 50,335 $ 56,933 Percentage change from comparable period (15.2) % (6.8) % (11.6) % (1.7) % Operating income $ 861 $ 812 $ 2,055 $ 1,618 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.7 % 3.0 % 4.1 % 2.8 % Unit counts at period end 5,185 6,143 5,185 6,143 Retail square feet at period end 280 344 280 344 Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $4.1 billion or 15.2% and $6.6 billion or 11.6% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The reduction in net 21 Table of Contents sales was due to decreases of $8.9 billion and $13.1 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, primarily related to the divestiture of Asda and Seiyu during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The decreases were partially offset by positive net sales growth in several of our remaining markets, which included a benefit from lapping tighter government-mandated restrictions in the prior comparable periods, primarily in India. Net sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021 included positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $2.4 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. Gross profit rate decreased 76 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats, partially offset by lower markdowns. The divested markets also negatively impacted our gross profit rate. Gross profit rate decreased 14 basis points for the six months ended July 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats and the decrease related to our divested markets, partially offset by benefits in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 related to mix shifts into higher margin categories and lower markdowns. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 85 basis points and 87 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. For the three months ended July 31, 2021, the decrease was primarily due to lower incremental COVID-19 related costs as compared to the prior period and lapping a discrete tax charge in the prior comparable period. For the six months ended July 31, 2021, the decrease was primarily due to lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as well as lapping the discrete tax charge. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $49 million and $437 million for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Including Fuel Net sales $ 18,644 $ 16,375 $ 35,336 $ 31,538 Percentage change from comparable period 13.9 % 8.8 % 12.0 % 9.2 % Calendar comparable sales increase 13.9 % 8.8 % 12.0 % 9.2 % Operating income $ 660 $ 592 $ 1,235 $ 1,086 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.5 % 3.6 % 3.5 % 3.4 % Unit counts at period end 599 599 599 599 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 16,437 $ 15,264 $ 31,374 $ 29,333 Percentage change from comparable period 7.7 % 13.5 % 7.0 % 13.2 % Operating income $ 575 $ 527 $ 1,105 $ 925 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.5 % 3.5 % 3.5 % 3.2 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $2.3 billion or 13.9% and $3.8 billion or 12.0% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 13.9% and 12.0% for the three and six months ended, respectively. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and was aided by stimulus spending. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce net sales positively contributed approximately 1.1% and 1.9% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively. Gross profit rate decreased 88 and 47 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The gross profit rates were negatively impacted by increased fuel sales which have lower margins and cost inflation, partially offset by favorable changes in mix. Membership and other income increased 13.1% and 12.3% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to increases in overall renewal rates, new member sign-ups and Plus penetration. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 and 52 basis points and for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases were 22 Table of Contents primarily the result of higher fuel sales as well as a benefit from lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by increased wage investments and reduced tobacco sales when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.1 billion for both the three and six months ended July 31, 2021 when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. In the current environment, we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 12,423 $ 18,956 Net cash provided by operating activities was $12.4 billion and $19.0 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended July 31, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in inventory purchases due in part to lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in the first half of fiscal 2021. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $22.8 billion and $16.9 billion at July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our working capital deficit was $2.9 billion as of July 31, 2021, which decreased when compared to $17.0 billion as of July 31, 2020, primarily driven by the increase in inventory described above as well as an increase in cash and cash equivalents. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of July 31, 2021 and January 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents of $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $3.0 billion at July 31, 2021, approximately $1.0 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Provided by or Used in Investing Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 2,402 $ (3,634) Net cash provided by investing activities was $2.4 billion as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3.6 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities increased $6.0 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2021 primarily due to the net proceeds received from the divestitures of Asda and Seiyu, partially offset by increased capital expenditures. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash used in financing activities $ (11,559) $ (7,814) Net cash from financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of the Company's common stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $11.6 billion as compared to $7.8 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to increased share repurchases. 23 Table of Contents In April 2021, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at July 31, 2021, all undrawn. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary completed a $3.6 billion new equity funding, a portion of which was contributed by the Company, which reduced the Company's ownership of Flipkart to approximately 75%. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the six months ended July 31, 2021: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2021 $ 3,115 $ 41,194 $ 44,309 Repayments of long-term debt (3,010) — (3,010) Reclassifications of long-term debt 1,511 (1,511) — Other 1 (102) (101) Balances as of July 31, 2021 $ 1,617 $ 39,581 $ 41,198 Dividends Effective February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2022 annual dividend of $2.20 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2021 annual dividend of $2.16 per share. For fiscal 2022, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.55 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 19, 2021 April 5, 2021 May 7, 2021 June 1, 2021 August 13, 2021 September 7, 2021 December 10, 2021 January 3, 2022 The dividend installments payable on April 5, 2021 and June 1, 2021 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made prior to February 22, 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of July 31, 2021, authorization for $15.2 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the six months ended July 31, 2021 and 2020: Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 Total number of shares repurchased 37.7 6.3 Average price paid per share $ 137.94 $ 114.73 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 5,200 $ 723 Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal increases in merchandise inventories, our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. 24 Table of Contents We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in the capital markets. We also have $15.0 billion in various committed lines of credit in the U.S., all of which currently remains undrawn. At July 31, 2021, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. Our market risks at July 31, 2021 are similar to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on March 19, 2021, under the caption "" Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 25 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 26 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption ""Item 1. Financial Statements,"" in Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings."" We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,100 cases as of August 23, 2021, some of which cases are in the process of being transferred to the MDL or have remand motions pending. A trial is currently scheduled to begin in one of the MDL cases in October 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing and distribution claims. There is one case in which the Company is named as a defendant that was remanded from the MDL court to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, where trial is currently scheduled to begin in September 2022. In addition, there are over 200 state court cases pending as of August 23, 2021, some of which may be removed to federal court to seek MDL transfer. The case citations for the state court cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the ""CSA""). The Company’s action, Walmart Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice et al., USDC, Eastern Dist. of Texas, 10/22/20, was dismissed. The Company has appealed this decision to the fifth circuit and awaits the court's decision. A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the DOJ against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the CSA related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et a l., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. The DOJ filed its opposition brief on April 23, 2021 and the Company filed its reply brief on May 24, 2021. Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Two derivative complaints and two securities class action lawsuits drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming various current and former directors and certain officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution; and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company’s disclosures with respect to opioids were purportedly filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the court consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v. McMillon et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 4/16/21. Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and Martin v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC , Dist. of DE, 3/5/21, consolidated into In re Walmart Inc. Securities Litigation , USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21. 27 Table of Contents II.

Money Transfer Agent Services Proceedings: The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company’s consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company’s money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas and is cooperating with the government’s investigation. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the ""FTC"") and is cooperating with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. The Company is engaging in discussions with the FTC regarding a potential resolution of this matter, although there can be no assurance that the Company will reach any such resolution with the FTC. If there is no resolution of the matter, the FTC staff could request authority of the FTC to file a civil complaint against the Company seeking various forms of monetary and injunctive relief. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of the investigations, any discussions, or any related actions by the governmental entities regarding these matters. While the Company does not currently believe that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and final outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (""Flipkart""), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the ""Rules"") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, or whether the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold of $1 million. In June 2021, the Company signed a tolling agreement with the State of California to toll the statute of limitations for potential claims regarding Walmart’s management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The Company is presently engaged in settlement discussions. It is not presently known whether a settlement will be reached or enforcement action will ensue, but the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. The Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 28 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption ""Risk Factors,"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made prior to February 22, 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of July 31, 2021, authorization for $15.2 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended July 31, 2021, was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) May 1 - 31, 2021 5,141,955 $ 140.73 5,141,955 $ 16.9 June 1 - 30, 2021 6,521,995 138.89 6,521,995 16.0 July 1 - 31, 2021 5,242,319 141.11 5,242,319 15.2 Total 16,906,269 16,906,269 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of April related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Use of Estimates The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Investments Investments in equity and debt securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value of equity securities measured on a recurring basis are recognized in other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 5 for details. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost and are adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments in debt securities classified as trading are reported at fair value with interest income recorded in interest income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. As of April 30, 2021, the Company had $ 1.0 billion in debt securities classified as trading. Indemnification Liabilities The Company has provided certain indemnifications in connection with its divestitures and has recorded indemnification liabilities equal to the estimated fair value of the obligations upon inception. As of April 30, 2021 and January 31, 2021, the Company had $ 1.3 billion and $ 0.6 billion, respectively, of certain legal and tax indemnification liabilities recorded within deferred income taxes and other in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these indemnities was $ 4.2 billion, based on exchange rates as of April 30, 2021. 8 Table of Contents Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and 2020. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 2,811 $ 4,074 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 81 ) ( 84 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 2,730 $ 3,990 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,815 2,831 Dilutive impact of share-based awards 14 18 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,829 2,849 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 0.97 $ 1.41 Diluted 0.97 1.40 Note 3. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for derivative instruments are generally recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation and any related net investment hedge impacts resulting from a disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program. In April 2021, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364 -day revolving credit facility of $ 10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $ 5.0 billion. In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15.0 billion at April 30, 2021 and January 31, 2021, all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the three months ended April 30, 2021: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2021 $ 3,115 $ 41,194 $ 44,309 Repayments of long-term debt ( 510 ) — ( 510 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 894 ( 894 ) — Other 1 ( 27 ) ( 26 ) Balances as of April 30, 2021 $ 3,500 $ 40,273 $ 43,773 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. As described in Note 1 , the Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments on a recurring basis in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the Company's equity investments measured on a recurring basis is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of April 30, 2021 Fair Value as of January 31, 2021 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 6,050 $ 6,517 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 6,217 7,905 Total $ 12,267 $ 14,422 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of April 30, 2021 and January 31, 2021, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: April 30, 2021 January 31, 2021 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 3,250 $ 140 (1) $ 3,250 $ 166 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges — — 1,250 311 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 8,324 ( 405 ) (2) 5,073 ( 394 ) (2) Total $ 11,574 $ ( 265 ) $ 9,573 $ 83 (1) Classified in other long-term assets within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Classified primarily in deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. 10 Table of Contents As of January 31, 2021, the Company's operations in the U.K. (""Asda"") and operations in Japan (""Seiyu"") met the held for sale criteria, and as a result the Company recorded non-recurring impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as the carrying value of the disposal groups exceeded their fair value, less costs to sell. Upon completing the sales of Asda in February 2021 and Seiyu in March 2021, the Company recorded incremental non-recurring impairment charges of $ 0.4 billion during the three months ended April 30, 2021 within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 6 . The Company did not have other material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of April 30, 2021. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of April 30, 2021 and January 31, 2021, are as follows: April 30, 2021 January 31, 2021 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 43,773 $ 51,822 $ 44,309 $ 54,240 Note 6. Divestitures During fiscal 2022, the Company completed the following transactions related to the Company's Walmart International segment. After closing these transactions, total assets of the Walmart International segment were $ 86.4 billion as of April 30, 2021, as compared to $ 109.4 billion as of January 31, 2021. Asda In February 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Asda, the Company's retail operations in the U.K., for net consideration of $ 9.6 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $ 0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Asda and recognized its retained investment in Asda as a debt security within other long-term assets and also recognized certain legal and tax indemnity liabilities within deferred income taxes and other on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Seiyu In March 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Seiyu, the Company's retail operations in Japan, for net consideration of $ 1.2 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $ 0.2 billion in other gains and losses in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Seiyu and recognized its retained 15 percent ownership interest in Seiyu as an equity investment within other long-term assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 7. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 11 Table of Contents Opioids Litigation In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”). The Company’s action was dismissed and the Company is appealing the decision. On December 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the CSA. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. The DOJ filed its opposition brief on April 23, 2021 and the Company filed its reply brief on May 24, 2021. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company’s disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company’s distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from the various Opioids Litigation and intends to vigorously defend these litigation matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Other Matters Asda Equal Value Claims Prior to the divestiture of Asda, the Company, through its Asda subsidiary, was a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees (the ""Asda Equal Value Claims""), and further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company will continue to conduct the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters. Note 8. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale, eCommerce websites and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. 12 Table of Contents The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 93,167 $ 88,743 Walmart International 27,300 29,766 Sam's Club 16,692 15,163 Net sales $ 137,159 $ 133,672 Operating income by segment, as well as operating loss for corporate and support, interest, net and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 5,455 $ 4,302 Walmart International 1,194 806 Sam's Club 575 494 Corporate and support ( 315 ) ( 378 ) Operating income 6,909 5,224 Interest, net 536 549 Other (gains) and losses 2,529 ( 721 ) Income before income taxes $ 3,844 $ 5,396 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category. When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club. (Amounts in millions) Three Months Ended April 30, Walmart U.S. net sales by merchandise category 2021 2020 Grocery $ 51,391 $ 52,921 General merchandise 30,607 25,466 Health and wellness 9,970 9,600 Other categories 1,199 756 Total $ 93,167 $ 88,743 Of Walmart U.S.'s total net sales, approximately $ 11.3 billion and $ 8.3 billion related to eCommerce for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 13 Table of Contents (Amounts in millions) Three Months Ended April 30, Walmart International net sales by market 2021 2020 Mexico and Central America $ 8,330 $ 8,496 United Kingdom 3,811 7,132 Canada 4,848 4,286 China 3,773 3,368 Other 6,538 6,484 Total $ 27,300 $ 29,766 Of Walmart International's total net sales, approximately $ 4.3 billion and $ 2.9 billion related to eCommerce for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022 (""fiscal 2022"") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three months ended April 30, 2021, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2021, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2021. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Consistent with our strategy to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, we completed the following actions during the three months ended April 30, 2021: • Completed the sale of Asda, our retail business in the U.K., for net consideration of $9.6 billion in February 2021. During the three months ended April 30, 2021, we recognized an incremental non-cash loss of $0.2 billion, after tax, primarily due to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. • Completed the sale of Seiyu, our retail business in Japan, for net consideration of $1.2 billion in March 2021. During the three months ended April 30, 2021, we recognized an incremental non-cash loss of $0.2 billion, after tax, primarily due to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. 15 Table of Contents We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, global health epidemics including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "" Item 5. Other Information ."" We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID–19 pandemic; the duration and extent of economic stimulus; timing and effectiveness of global vaccines; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, were as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 5.3 % 10.6 % 0.2 % (0.2) % Sam's Club 10.1 % 9.6 % 3.9 % (3.4) % Total U.S. 6.0 % 10.5 % 0.8 % (0.6) % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 6.0% for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 5.3% for the three months ended April 30, 2021 driven by growth in average ticket, primarily aided by consumer stimulus spending. Customers continued to consolidate shopping trips and purchase larger baskets which contributed to average ticket growth while transactions decreased overall for the quarter, turning positive in April 2021. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 3.5% to comparable sales for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery and walmart.com. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment increased 10.1% for the three months ended April 30, 2021. The Sam's Club segment's comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket, which was aided by stimulus spending, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.8% to comparable sales for the three months ended April 30, 2021. 16 Table of Contents Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net sales $ 137,159 $ 133,672 Percentage change from comparable period 2.6 % 8.7 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 28,129 $ 27,372 Percentage change from comparable period 2.8 % 5.5 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 20.5 % 20.5 % Despite the growth in net sales, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2021 was relatively flat when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Increased wage and technology investments in the Walmart U.S. segment were offset by $0.5 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, as well as a benefit from depreciation and amortization expense not recorded subsequent to the held for sale classification of our operations in the U.K. and Japan in fiscal 2021. Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. As such, we are allocating more capital to supply chain, customer-facing initiatives, technology and store remodels, and less to new store and club openings. The following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Three Months Ended April 30, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2021 2020 Supply chain, customer-facing initiatives and technology $ 1,013 $ 823 Store remodels 613 438 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 38 23 Total U.S. 1,664 1,284 Walmart International 550 468 Total Capital Expenditures $ 2,214 $ 1,752 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.3% and 6.6% for the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the losses on divestiture of our operations in the U.K., Japan and Argentina, partially offset by the increase in operating income as well as the fair value change in our equity investments. ROI was 14.4% and 13.4% for the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2021 and 2020. The increase in ROI was primarily due to the increase in operating income. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts 17 Table of Contents operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 12,443 $ 15,369 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 234,737 $ 233,718 Return on assets (ROA) 5.3 % 6.6 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 24,233 $ 20,847 + Interest income 108 184 + Depreciation and amortization 11,022 11,062 + Rent 2,534 2,694 = ROI operating income $ 37,897 $ 34,787 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 234,737 $ 233,718 ' + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 95,424 90,970 ' - Average accounts payable (1) 46,124 44,603 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 20,874 20,700 = Average invested capital $ 263,163 $ 259,385 Return on investment (ROI) 14.4 % 13.4 % (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2.

Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $2.9 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2021, which decreased when compared to $7.0 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2020 primarily due to an increase in inventory purchases due in part to lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We generated free cash flow of $0.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2021, which decreased when compared to $5.3 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2020 due to the same reasons as the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.5 billion in increased capital expenditures. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,858 $ 7,017 Payments for property and equipment (2,214) (1,752) Free cash flow $ 644 $ 5,265 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1) $ 5,850 $ (1,696) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (5,399) 565 (1) ""Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 19 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 Total revenues $ 138,310 $ 134,622 Percentage change from comparable period 2.7 % 8.6% Net sales $ 137,159 $ 133,672 Percentage change from comparable period 2.6 % 8.7% Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 6.0 % 10.5% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 24.7 % 23.7% Operating income $ 6,909 $ 5,224 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.0 % 3.9% Other (gains) and losses $ 2,529 $ (721) Consolidated net income $ 2,811 $ 4,074 Unit counts at period end 10,526 11,484 Retail square feet at period end 1,065 1,128 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $3.7 billion or 2.7% for the three months ended April 30, 2021, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenue were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which benefited from consumer stimulus dollars in the U.S., along with positive comparable sales in several of our remaining international markets. These increases were partially offset by a $4.2 billion decrease in net sales primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in February 2021 and March 2021, respectively. Net sales also benefited from a $0.9 billion positive impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three months ended April 30, 2021. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") increased 104 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by mix shifts into general merchandise in the Walmart U.S. segment, due in part to stimulus, lower markdowns and lapping last year's COVID-19 related mix shifts into lower margin categories such as food and consumables. Despite the growth in net sales, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Increased wage and technology investments in the Walmart U.S. segment were partially offset by $0.5 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, as well as a benefit from depreciation and amortization expense not recorded subsequent to the held for sale classification of our operations in the U.K. and Japan in fiscal 2021. Other gains and losses for the three months ended April 30, 2021 consisted of a net loss of $2.5 billion which primarily reflects $2.1 billion in net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, as well as $0.4 billion in incremental losses associated with the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan upon closing of the transactions during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For the three months ended April 30, 2020, other gains and losses consisted of a gain of $0.7 billion, primarily representing the fair value change of our JD.com investment. Our effective income tax rate was 26.9% for the three months ended April 30, 2021, which increased 237 basis points as compared to 24.5% for the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to the incremental loss on sale of our operations in the U.K. and Japan which provided minimal realizable tax benefit during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income decreased $1.3 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2021, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $0.97 for the three months ended April 30, 2021, which represents a decrease of $0.43 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. 20 Table of Contents Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 Net sales $ 93,167 $ 88,743 Percentage change from comparable period 5.0 % 10.5 % Calendar comparable sales increase 5.3 % 10.6 % Operating income $ 5,455 $ 4,302 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.9 % 4.8 % Unit counts at period end 4,743 4,753 Retail square feet at period end 703 703 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $4.4 billion or 5.0% for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was due to comparable sales of 5.3% for the three months ended April 30, 2021, driven by growth in average ticket primarily aided by consumer stimulus spending. Customers continued to consolidate shopping trips and purchase larger baskets which contributed to the growth in average ticket while transactions decreased overall for the quarter, turning positive in April 2021. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 3.5% to comparable sales during the three months ended April 30, 2021 and was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery and walmart.com. Gross profit rate increased 142 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by mix shifts into general merchandise due in part to stimulus and lapping last year's COVID-related mix shifts into food and consumables, as well as lower markdowns. Despite the increase in net sales, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 49 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to increased wage and technology investments, partially offset by $0.4 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $1.2 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2021, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 Net sales $ 27,300 $ 29,766 Percentage change from comparable period (8.3) % 3.4 % Operating income $ 1,194 $ 806 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.4 % 2.7 % Unit counts at period end 5,184 6,132 Retail square feet at period end 282 345 Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $2.5 billion or 8.3% for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease in net sales was due to a $4.2 billion decrease primarily related to the divestiture of Asda and Seiyu, which closed in February 2021 and March 2021, respectively, partially offset by positive net sales growth in several of our remaining markets. Net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2021 includes positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $0.9 billion. Gross profit rate increased 42 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily due to mix shifts to higher margin categories and fewer markdowns as well as a net benefit related to the previously mentioned divestitures. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 86 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to depreciation and amortization expense not being recorded subsequent to the held for sale classification of Asda and Seiyu in fiscal 2021, as well as a benefit from lower incremental COVID-19 related costs as compared to the prior comparable period. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.4 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2021, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. 21 Table of Contents Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2021 2020 Including Fuel Net sales $ 16,692 $ 15,163 Percentage change from comparable period 10.1 % 9.6 % Calendar comparable sales increase 10.1 % 9.6 % Operating income $ 575 $ 494 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.4 % 3.3 % Unit counts at period end 599 599 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 14,937 $ 14,069 Percentage change from comparable period 6.2 % 13.0 % Operating income $ 530 $ 398 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.5 % 2.8 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $1.5 billion or 10.1% for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Our 10.1% growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and was aided by stimulus spending. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce net sales positively contributed approximately 2.8% to comparable sales for the three months ended April 30, 2021. Gross profit rate was relatively flat for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The gross profit rate was negatively impacted by increased fuel sales which have lower margins, offset by favorable merchandise mix and lower tobacco sales. Membership and other income increased 11.4% for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase for the three months ended April 30, 2021 was due to increases in overall renewal rates, new member sign-ups and Plus penetration. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 18 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily the result of higher fuel sales as well as a benefit from lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by increased wage investments and reduced tobacco sales when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.1 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2021, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. In the current environment, we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,858 $ 7,017 Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion and $7.0 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended April 30, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in inventory purchases due in part to lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 22 Table of Contents Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $22.8 billion and $14.9 billion at April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our working capital deficit was $4.3 billion as of April 30, 2021, which decreased when compared to $19.3 billion as of April 30, 2020, primarily driven by the increase in cash and cash equivalents as well as the increase in inventory described above. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of April 30, 2021 and January 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.3 billion at April 30, 2021, approximately $0.5 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Provided by or Used in Investing Activities Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 5,850 $ (1,696) Net cash provided by investing activities was $5.9 billion as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $1.7 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities increased $7.5 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2021 primarily due to the net proceeds received from the divestitures of Asda and Seiyu , partially offset by increased capital expenditures. Net Cash Used in or Provided by Financing Activities Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (5,399) $ 565 Net cash used in or provided by financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $5.4 billion as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $0.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to a reduction in short-term borrowings as well as increased share repurchases. In April 2021, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at April 30, 2021, all undrawn. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the three months ended April 30, 2021: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2021 $ 3,115 $ 41,194 $ 44,309 Repayments of long-term debt (510) — (510) Reclassifications of long-term debt 894 (894) — Other 1 (27) (26) Balances as of April 30, 2021 $ 3,500 $ 40,273 $ 43,773 Dividends Effective February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2022 annual dividend of $2.20 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2021 annual dividend of $2.16 per share. For fiscal 2022, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.55 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 19, 2021 April 5, 2021 May 7, 2021 June 1, 2021 August 13, 2021 September 7, 2021 December 10, 2021 January 3, 2022 The dividend installments payable on April 5, 2021 and June 1, 2021 were paid as scheduled. 23 Table of Contents Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made prior to February 22, 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of April 30, 2021, authorization for $17.6 billion of share repurchases remained under the new share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the three months ended April 30, 2021 and 2020: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 Total number of shares repurchased 20.6 6.3 Average price paid per share $ 136.18 $ 114.73 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 2,809 $ 723 Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal increases in merchandise inventories, our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in the capital markets. We also have $15.0 billion in various committed lines of credit in the U.S., all of which currently remains undrawn. At April 30, 2021, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. Our market risks at April 30, 2021 are similar to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on March 19, 2021, under the caption "" Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 25 Table of Contents PART II.

Federal and State Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of May 24, 2021, some of which cases are in the process of being transferred to the MDL or have remand motions pending. A trial is currently scheduled to begin in one of the MDL cases in October 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing and distribution claims. There is one case in which the Company is named as a defendant that was remanded from the MDL court to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. In addition, there are over 200 state court cases pending as of May 24, 2021, some of which may be removed to federal court to seek MDL transfer. The case citations for the state cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-Q. DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”). The Company’s action, Walmart Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice et al., USDC, Eastern Dist. of Texas, 10/22/20, was dismissed and the Company is appealing the decision. A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the DOJ against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the CSA related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et a l., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. The DOJ filed its opposition brief on April 23, 2021 and the Company filed its reply brief on May 24, 2021. Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Two derivative complaints and two securities class action lawsuits drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming various current and former directors and certain officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution; and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company’s disclosures about opioids. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company’s disclosures with respect to opioids were purportedly filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the court consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v. McMillon et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 4/16/21. Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and Martin v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC , Dist. of DE, 3/5/21, consolidated into In re Walmart Inc. Securities Litigation , USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21. 26 Table of Contents II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS ASDA Equal Value Claims : Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); and ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal). Money Transfer Agent Services Proceedings: The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company’s consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company’s money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas and is cooperating with the government’s investigation. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and is cooperating with the FTC’s investigation related to money transfers and the Company’s anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. The Company may engage in discussions with the FTC staff regarding an appropriate resolution of this matter, although there can be no assurance that if those discussions occur, the Company would reach any such resolution with the FTC. If there is no resolution of the matter, the FTC staff could request authority of the FTC to file a civil complaint against the Company seeking various forms of monetary and injunctive relief. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of the investigations, any discussions, or any related actions by the governmental entities regarding these matters. While the Company does not currently believe that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and final outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold of $1 million. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters to disclose for this period. 27 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption ""Risk Factors,"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made prior to February 22, 2021 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022. On February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning February 22, 2021, replaced the previous share repurchase program. As of April 30, 2021, authorization for $17.6 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended April 30, 2021, was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) February 1 - 28, 2021 4,943,498 $ 139.45 4,943,498 $ 19.8 March 1 - 31, 2021 9,167,264 131.91 9,167,264 18.5 April 1 - 30, 2021 6,688,136 139.47 6,688,136 17.6 Total 20,798,898 20,798,898 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of October related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions, including potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Receivables In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2020 with no material impact to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for credit losses, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which also includes insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales, banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. 9 Table of C ontents Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019.

Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation resulting from a disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant. Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program. In April 2020, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364 -day revolving credit facility of $ 10.0 billion. In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15.0 billion at October 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020, all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the nine months ended October 31, 2020: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2020 $ 5,362 $ 43,714 $ 49,076 Repayments of long-term debt ( 4,132 ) — ( 4,132 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 3,126 ( 3,126 ) — Other 2 261 263 Balances as of October 31, 2020 $ 4,358 $ 40,849 $ 45,207 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company measures the fair value of equity investments on a recurring basis in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the Company's equity investments recorded in other long-term assets are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of October 31, 2020 Fair Value as of January 31, 2020 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 5,987 $ 2,715 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 6,782 2,723 Total $ 12,769 $ 5,438 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of October 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: October 31, 2020 January 31, 2020 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 3,250 $ 177 (1) $ 4,000 $ 97 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges 3,500 446 (1) 3,750 455 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 4,206 ( 722 ) (2) 4,067 ( 696 ) (2) Total $ 10,956 $ ( 99 ) $ 11,817 $ ( 144 ) (1) Classified in Other long-term assets within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Classified in Deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 11 Table of C ontents Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements as of October 31, 2020. Refer to Note 6 for additional information regarding the sale of Walmart Argentina. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of October 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020, are as follows: October 31, 2020 January 31, 2020 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 45,207 $ 55,257 $ 49,076 $ 57,769 Note 6. Divestitures During fiscal 2021, the Company announced the following actions related to the Company's Walmart International segment. Asda In October 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement and announced the proposed divestiture of Asda Group Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (""Asda”), for an enterprise value of £ 6.8 billion, or approximately $ 9.1 billion based on current exchange rates. Due to uncertainty of the macro-economic environment and a complex regulatory review process, the outcome of which is uncertain, the held for sale criteria for the disposal group was not met as of October 31, 2020, and accordingly no impacts have been reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Walmart Argentina In November 2020, the Company completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and classified the disposal group as held for sale as of October 31, 2020 in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $ 1.0 billion during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 in other gains and losses in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income primarily due to the impact of cumulative translation losses on the carrying value of the disposal group. Seiyu In November 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell a majority stake in Seiyu, the Company's retail business in Japan, for an enterprise value of ¥ 172.5 billion, or approximately $ 1.7 billion based on current exchange rates. As the disposal group met the held for sale criteria subsequent to October 31, 2020, the Company will recognize a non-cash loss of approximately $ 2.0 billion, after tax, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. This estimate may fluctuate based on currency exchange rates and customary purchase price adjustments up to the closing date of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and is subject to regulatory approvals. Note 7. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 12 Table of C ontents ASDA Equal Value Claims ASDA Stores Ltd., an Asda subsidiary, is a defendant in over 40,000 equal value (""Equal Value"") claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the ""Employment Tribunal"") in the United Kingdom (""U.K."") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. Asda appealed the ruling and the oral argument was held before the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in July 2020. The Company is awaiting a decision. Notwithstanding the appeal, claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. Prescription Opiate Litigation and Other Matters In December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. Note 8. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale, eCommerce websites and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. 13 Table of C ontents The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Beginning with the first quarter in fiscal 2021, the Company revised its definition of eCommerce net sales to include certain pharmacy transactions and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts to maintain comparability. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 88,353 $ 83,189 $ 270,378 $ 248,733 Walmart International 29,554 29,167 86,487 87,081 Sam's Club 15,845 14,625 47,383 43,504 Net sales $ 133,752 $ 126,981 $ 404,248 $ 379,318 Operating income by segment, as well as operating loss for corporate and support, interest, net and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 4,589 $ 4,176 $ 13,948 $ 12,977 Walmart International 1,078 634 2,696 2,265 Sam's Club 431 327 1,517 1,258 Corporate and support ( 320 ) ( 419 ) ( 1,100 ) ( 1,254 ) Operating income 5,778 4,718 17,061 15,246 Interest, net 516 589 1,700 1,799 Other (gains) and losses ( 1,853 ) ( 244 ) ( 5,796 ) ( 996 ) Income before income taxes $ 7,115 $ 4,373 $ 21,157 $ 14,443 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category. When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021"") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2020, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2020. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally and those initiated through mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Consistent with our strategy to further position our Walmart International portfolio enabling long-term, sustainable and profitable growth, we have taken the following actions: • In October 2020, we agreed to sell Asda Group Limited (""Asda”) for an enterprise value of £6.8 billion, or approximately $9.1 billion based on current exchange rates. When the disposal group meets the held for sale criteria, we expect to recognize a non-cash loss of approximately $5.5 billion, after tax, which includes the estimated loss on sale as well as the loss associated with the derecognition of the Asda pension plan. This loss may fluctuate based on currency exchange rates and customary purchase price adjustments. The loss associated with the derecognition of the Asda pension plan will be recognized at the earlier of either the disposal group meeting the held for sale criteria or the pension buy-out. We expect the impact of removing Asda from our Walmart International segment to dilute earnings per share by $0.25 in the first full year following completion of the transaction reflecting the absence of net income from Asda. Refer to Note 6 . • In November 2020, we completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and classified the disposal group as held for sale as of October 31, 2020 in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As a result, we recorded a non-cash loss of $1.0 billion, after-tax, during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation losses. Refer to Note 6 . 16 Table of C ontents • In November 2020, we agreed to sell a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail business in Japan, for an enterprise value of ¥172.5 billion, or approximately $1.7 billion based on current exchange rates. As the disposal group met the held for sale criteria subsequent to October 31, 2020, we will recognize a non-cash loss of approximately $2.0 billion, after tax, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. This estimate may fluctuate based on currency exchange rates and customary purchase price adjustments up to the closing date of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and is subject to regulatory approvals. Refer to Note 6 . We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events and global health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "" Item 5. Other Information ."" COVID-19 Updates Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture, become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. These areas of focus are fundamental in running our business every day, and even more so now as Walmart plays an important role during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout fiscal 2021, we have operated with a clear set of priorities to guide our decision making through the COVID-19 pandemic. These priorities are: • Supporting our associates on the front lines in terms of their physical safety, financial health and emotional well-being. We are providing extra pay and benefits, including $1.3 billion to date in special cash bonuses to field associates and the introduction of a COVID-19 Emergency Leave Policy. • Serving our customers as safely as possible and keeping our supply chain operating. We reduced our store operating hours at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and have since expanded store hours slightly during the third quarter. • Helping others which includes waiving or discounting rent for in-store tenants in April and May 2020 as well as hiring more than 500,000 new associates. • Managing the business well both operationally and financially and driving our long-term strategy. We are maintaining our everyday low-price discipline while investing in our omni-channel offering which continues to resonate with customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience. While we incurred incremental costs associated with operating during a global health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in overall net sales growth during the first three quarters of fiscal 2021 with strong comparable sales in the U.S. and the majority of our international markets. Sales trends were positively impacted by eCommerce growth acceleration as well as customers consolidating shopping trips and purchasing larger baskets. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID–19 pandemic; the duration and extent of economic stimulus; the length and impact of any stay–at–home orders or government mandates; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which will impact our results in the short term. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. The COVID-19 pandemic led to increased demand and overall net sales growth through the first three quarters of fiscal 2021. As our Company continues to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized our focus on associate care, including extra pay and benefits as well as masks and gloves; increased cleaning and sanitation measures; customer safety; and new associate hiring. Additionally, we've shifted the timing of certain capital spending and consulting projects, and reduced marketing and travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 17 Table of C ontents Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 6.6 % 3.3 % (0.1) % 0.0 % 8.9 % 3.1 % (0.2) % 0.0 % Sam's Club 8.3 % 0.6 % (3.3) % 0.1 % 8.9 % 1.3 % (3.8) % 0.6 % Total U.S. 6.8 % 2.9 % (0.6) % 0.0 % 8.9 % 2.8 % (0.7) % 0.0 % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 6.8% and 8.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 6.6% and 8.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a decline in transactions as customers consolidated shopping trips. Beginning in mid-September, we began seeing improvement in transactions as store hours were slightly expanded. With the shift in purchasing behavior, Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 5.6% and 5.2% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, and was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery and walmart.com. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment were 8.3% and 8.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively. The Sam's Club segment's comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% and 2.0% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively. Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net sales $ 133,752 $ 126,981 $ 404,248 $ 379,318 Percentage change from comparable period 5.3 % 2.5 % 6.6 % 1.8 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 28,591 $ 27,373 $ 84,957 $ 80,190 Percentage change from comparable period 4.4 % 2.2 % 5.9 % 1.1 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.4 % 21.6 % 21.0 % 21.1 % For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, we leveraged operating expenses, decreasing operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 18 and 12 basis points, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 were strong sales and lapping a non-cash impairment charge in the prior year, partially offset by $0.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the nine months ended October 31, 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was also impacted by a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. 18 Table of C ontents Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. In recent years, we have allocated more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings. We will continue to remain disciplined with our capital spending in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Total capital expenditures for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 decreased compared to the prior year due to the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted the timing of store remodeling and front-end technology transformation activities in Walmart U.S.; the following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Nine Months Ended October 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2021 2020 eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other $ 3,316 $ 3,859 Store remodels 1,531 1,855 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 64 67 Total U.S. 4,911 5,781 Walmart International 1,527 1,984 Total Capital Expenditures $ 6,438 $ 7,765 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 8.2% and 6.3% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily driven by the change in fair value of our equity investments, partially offset by the loss on sale of Walmart Argentina. ROI was flat at 13.7% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. For the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2019, lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of that balance sheet date, rather than averaged, because they are not directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8. A two-point average was used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (""ASU 2016-02""). Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. 19 Table of C ontents The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending October 31 (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 20,008 $ 14,720 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 245,347 $ 233,207 Return on assets (ROA) 8.2 % 6.3 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 22,383 $ 21,313 + Interest income 132 212 + Depreciation and amortization 11,161 10,889 + Rent 2,646 2,733 = ROI operating income $ 36,322 $ 35,147 Denominator Average total assets (1),(2) $ 245,347 $ 240,261 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1), (2) 95,637 87,982 - Average accounts payable (1) 51,951 49,740 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 22,984 21,884 = Average invested capital $ 266,049 $ 256,619 Return on investment (ROI) 13.7 % 13.7 % As of October 31, 2020 2019 2018 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 250,863 $ 239,830 $ 226,583 Leased assets, net NP 21,099 6,991 Total assets without leased assets, net NP 218,731 219,592 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 99,576 91,697 85,827 Accumulated amortization on leased assets NP 4,140 5,701 Accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets NP 87,557 80,126 Accounts payable 54,152 49,750 49,729 Accrued liabilities 24,995 20,973 22,795 (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the corresponding prior period and dividing by 2. Average total assets as used in ROA includes the average impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02. (2) For the twelve months ended October 31, 2019, as a result of adopting ASU 2016-02, average total assets is based on the average of total assets without leased assets, net plus leased assets, net as of October 31, 2019. Average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets plus accumulated amortization on leased assets as of October 31, 2019. NP = Not provided 20 Table of C ontents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $22.9 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020, which increased when compared to $14.5 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments. We generated free cash flow of $16.4 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020, which increased when compared to $6.8 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 due to the same reasons as the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $1.3 billion in decreased capital expenditures due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted the timing of store remodeling and front-end technology transformation activities in Walmart U.S. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 22,880 $ 14,539 Payments for property and equipment (6,438) (7,765) Free cash flow $ 16,442 $ 6,774 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (6,507) $ (6,285) Net cash used in financing activities (11,340) (7,213) (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 21 Table of C ontents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 2021 2020 Total revenues $ 134,708 $ 127,991 $ 407,072 $ 382,293 Percentage change from comparable period 5.2% 2.5% 6.5 % 1.8% Net sales $ 133,752 $ 126,981 $ 404,248 $ 379,318 Percentage change from comparable period 5.3% 2.5% 6.6 % 1.8% Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 6.8% 2.9% 8.9 % 2.8% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 25.0% 24.5% 24.5 % 24.4% Operating income $ 5,778 $ 4,718 $ 17,061 $ 15,246 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.3% 3.7% 4.2 % 4.0% Other (gains) and losses $ (1,853) $ (244) $ (5,796) $ (996) Consolidated net income $ 5,201 $ 3,321 $ 15,714 $ 10,907 Unit counts at period end 11,510 11,438 11,510 11,438 Retail square feet at period end 1,128 1,128 1,128 1,128 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $6.7 billion or 5.2% and $24.8 billion or 6.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenue were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments resulting from strong demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets. Overall net sales growth was strong despite certain operating limitations in several markets in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases were partially offset by a $1.1 billion and $4.8 billion negative impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mix of sales shifted initially toward food and consumables as consumers initiated stock-up trips. As the pandemic continued into the second and third quarter, sales in food and consumables have remained strong while we saw increased demand in several general merchandise categories, due in part to stimulus dollars in the U.S. during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. U.S. eCommerce sales remained strong throughout the year as more customers gravitated toward convenience and continued using pickup and delivery and our eCommerce websites. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") increased 50 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns, which was partially offset in the Walmart U.S. segment by carryover of prior year price investment. Gross profit as a percentage of sales for t he nine months ended October 31, 2020 increased 16 basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in the gross profit rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 was primarily due to strategic sourcing initiatives, strong sales in higher-margin categories, and fewer markdowns. This was partially offset in the Walmart U.S. segment by carryover of prior year price investment as well as the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 18 and 12 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year primarily due to strong sales and lapping a non-cash impairment charge in the prior year, partially offset by $0.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the nine months ended October 31, 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was also impacted by a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Other gains and losses for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 consisted of a gain of $1.9 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively, which primarily reflects the respective $2.7 billion and $6.0 billion fair value changes of our equity investments, partially offset by the $1.0 billion loss on sale of Walmart Argentina, which was classified as held for sale as of October 31, 2020. For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019, other gains and losses consisted of a gain of $0.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, primarily representing the fair value change of our JD.com investment. Our effective income tax rate was 26.9% and 25.7% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, which increased 284 and 125 basis points, respectively, as compared to 24.1% and 24.5% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to the loss on sale of Walmart Argentina recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 as it provided minimal realizable tax benefit. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. 22 Table of C ontents As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $1.9 billion and $4.8 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $1.80 and $5.48 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, which represents an increase of $0.65 and $1.74 when compared to the same periods, respectively, in the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net sales $ 88,353 $ 83,189 $ 270,378 $ 248,733 Percentage change from comparable period 6.2 % 3.2 % 8.7 % 3.1 % Calendar comparable sales increase 6.6 % 3.3 % 8.9 % 3.1 % Operating income $ 4,589 $ 4,176 $ 13,948 $ 12,977 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.2 % 5.0 % 5.2 % 5.2 % Unit counts at period end 4,748 4,759 4,748 4,759 Retail square feet at period end 703 703 703 703 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $5.2 billion or 6.2% and $21.6 billion or 8.7% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to comparable sales of 6.6% and 8.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from increased demand due to economic conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Customers continued to consolidate shopping trips and purchase larger baskets which contributed to the growth in average ticket while transactions decreased. With the shift in purchasing behavior, Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 5.6% and 5.2% to comparable sales during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, and was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery and walmart.com. Gross profit rate increased 33 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns, partially offset by the carryover of prior year price investment. Gross profit rate decreased 12 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to carryover of prior year price investment as well the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns. Despite the increase in net sales, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 9 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily due to $0.4 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which included additional costs associated with outfitting our stores and associates with masks, gloves and sanitizer, expanded cleaning practices, and expanded sick and emergency leave pay. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 13 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales, which were partially offset by $2.3 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic including special bonuses in the first and second quarter, the incremental COVID-19 costs described above, as well as a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 resulting from changes to Walmart U.S. support teams to better support its omni-channel strategy. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.4 billion and $1.0 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net sales $ 29,554 $ 29,167 $ 86,487 $ 87,081 Percentage change from comparable period 1.3 % 1.3 % (0.7) % (1.6) % Operating income $ 1,078 $ 634 $ 2,696 $ 2,265 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.6 % 2.2 % 3.1 % 2.6 % Unit counts at period end 6,163 6,080 6,163 6,080 Retail square feet at period end 345 344 345 344 Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $0.4 billion or 1.3% for the three months ended October 31, 2020 when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $1.1 billion. 23 Table of C ontents Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $0.6 billion or 0.7% for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.8 billion, which was partially offset by positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced significant economic pressures, and channel and mix shifts due to changes in consumer behavior, including accelerated growth in eCommerce in several markets. While several of our markets experienced extensive store and operational closures in the second quarter as a result of government mandates, most closed stores and warehouses had resumed operations by the third quarter. Gross profit rate increased 90 and 56 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to Flipkart's improved margin mix and reduced fuel sales in the U.K. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 73 and 8 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases were primarily due to lapping a $0.3 billion non-cash impairment charge in the previous fiscal year as well as the current period impact of a twelve-month property tax abatement in the U.K. and were partially offset by $0.1 billion and $0.4 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.4 billion for both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Including Fuel Net sales $ 15,845 $ 14,625 $ 47,383 $ 43,504 Percentage change from comparable period 8.3 % 0.7 % 8.9 % 1.3 % Calendar comparable sales increase 8.3 % 0.6 % 8.9 % 1.3 % Operating income $ 431 $ 327 $ 1,517 $ 1,258 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.7 % 2.2 % 3.2 % 2.9 % Unit counts at period end 599 599 599 599 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 14,596 $ 13,075 $ 43,929 $ 38,979 Percentage change from comparable period 11.6 % 0.6 % 12.7 % 0.8 % Operating income $ 358 $ 274 $ 1,283 $ 1,141 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.5 % 2.1 % 2.9 % 2.9 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $1.2 billion or 8.3% and $3.9 billion or 8.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.3% and 8.9% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% and 2.0% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively. Gross profit rate increased 79 and 69 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to higher fuel margins, reduced tobacco sales, and improvements in inventory losses. The increase in gross profit rate for the three months ended October 31, 2020 was partially offset by higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. The increase in gross profit rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. Membership and other incom e increased 7.9% and 5.8% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020 were due to increases in overall renewal rates, new member sign-ups and Plus penetration rate primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the increase in net sales from the strong demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 30 and 31 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, 24 Table of C ontents respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily the result of $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, which included additional costs such as special bonuses for club associates in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2021, expanded security and cleaning practices, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increases in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales were affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2020, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. In the current environment, we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 22,880 $ 14,539 Net cash provided by operating activities was $22.9 billion and $14.5 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended October 31, 2020, was primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $14.3 billion and $8.6 billion at October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We maintained more cash at October 31, 2020 compared to October 31, 2019 in order to provide us with enhanced financial flexibility due to the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our working capital deficit was $14.5 billion at October 31, 2020, which decreased when compared to $15.9 billion at October 31, 2019. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of October 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $3.4 billion at October 31, 2020, approximately $1.4 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2021 2020 Net cash used in investing activities $ (6,507) $ (6,285) Net cash used in investing activities was $6.5 billion and $6.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities increased $0.2 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020, primarily as a result of lapping the net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in Walmart Canada and the change in other investing activities, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures. 25 Table of C ontents Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net cash used in financing activities $ (11,340) $ (7,213) Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $11.3 billion and $7.2 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the timing of issuances and repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by a reduction in share repurchases as we manage our financial position during the current economic environment. In April 2020, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at October 31, 2020, all undrawn. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the nine months ended October 31, 2020: (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2020 $ 5,362 $ 43,714 $ 49,076 Repayments of long-term debt (4,132) — (4,132) Reclassifications of long-term debt 3,126 (3,126) — Other 2 261 263 Balances as of October 31, 2020 $ 4,358 $ 40,849 $ 45,207 Dividends On February 18, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2021 annual dividend of $2.16 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $2.12 per share. For fiscal 2021, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.54 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 20, 2020 April 6, 2020 May 8, 2020 June 1, 2020 August 14, 2020 September 8, 2020 December 11, 2020 January 4, 2021 The dividend installments payable on April 6, 2020, June 1, 2020, and September 8, 2020 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the nine months ended October 31, 2020 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of October 31, 2020, authorization for $4.5 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. 26 Table of C ontents We continue to review our share repurchase activity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the nine months ended October 31, 2020 and 2019: Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 Total number of shares repurchased 9.6 46.4 Average price paid per share $ 123.54 $ 103.98 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 1,186 $ 4,829 Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal increases in merchandise inventories, our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in the capital markets. We also have $15.0 billion in various committed lines of credit in the U.S., all of which currently remains undrawn. At October 31, 2020, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. Other Matters In N ote 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies"" and appears in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "" Item 1. Financial Statements ,"" we discuss, under the sub-caption ""ASDA Equal Value Claims,"" certain existing employment claims against Asda including certain risks arising therefrom. In that Note 7 , we also discuss, under the sub-caption ""Prescription Opiate Litigation and Other Matters,"" the Prescription Opiate Litigation and other matters, including certain risks arising therefrom. We also discuss various legal proceedings related to the ASDA Equal Value Claims, and the Prescription Opiate Litigation in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "" Item 1. Legal Proceedings ,"" under the sub-caption ""I. Supplemental Information."" The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or the market value of our investments. Our market risks at October 31, 2020 are similar to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on March 20, 2020, under the caption ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 27 Table of C ontents Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 28 Table of C ontents PART II.

We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. ASDA Equal Value Claims : Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); and ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal). Prescription Opiate Litigation : In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of November 19, 2020; some cases are in the process of being transferred to the MDL or have remand motions pending. A trial previously scheduled to begin on November 9, 2020 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid distribution claims has been postponed and no new trial date has been set. A trial is currently scheduled to begin in the MDL in May 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing and distribution claims. There is one case in which the Company is named as a defendant that was remanded from the MDL court to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. In addition, there are over 200 state court cases pending as of November 19, 2020, some of which may be removed to federal court to seek MDL transfer. The case citations for the state court cases and other information are included on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-Q. On October 22, 2020, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, asking a federal court to clarify the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies as to the dispensing and distribution of opioids under the Controlled Substances Act. Walmart Inc. v. DOJ, et al. is pending before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS : The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company’s consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company’s money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas. The Company has also been responding to civil investigative demands from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission related to money transfers and the Company’s anti-fraud program. Due to the investigative stage of these matters, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigations by the governmental entities. While the Company does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed a specified threshold. Pursuant to recent SEC amendments to this item, the Company will be using a threshold of $1 million for such proceedings. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters to disclose for this period. 29 Table of C ontents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions have had wide-ranging effects on our business and the global economy and have exacerbated the potential for certain risks identified in that disclosure, including, without limitation, risks related to the successful execution of our omni-channel strategy, operational risks associated with geo-political and catastrophic events, risks associated with our suppliers, reputational risks and risk associated with changes in and failure to comply with laws and regulations, to materially and adversely affect our financial performance. The financial impact to the Company of the COVID-19 pandemic during the nine month period ended October 31, 2020, as well as certain of the actions we have taken to protect the health and safety of our associates, customers, members and the communities we serve, are discussed in Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Given the uncertainty regarding the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effect in the U.S and the other markets we serve, there can be no assurance that the pandemic will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in the future. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the nine months ended October 31, 2020, were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of October 31, 2020, authorization for $4.5 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended October 31, 2020, was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) August 1 - 31, 2020 — $ — — $ 5.0 September 1 - 30, 2020 1,901,067 138.31 1,901,067 4.7 October 1 - 31, 2020 1,570,350 142.74 1,570,350 4.5 Total 3,471,417 3,471,417 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020 ""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of July related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions, including potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Receivables In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2020 with no material impact to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for credit losses, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which also includes insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales, banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. 9 Table of Contents Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019 .

Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant. 10 Table of Contents Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program. In April 2020, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364 -day revolving credit facility of $ 10.0 billion . In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15.0 billion at July 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020 , all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the six months ended July 31, 2020 : (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2020 $ 5,362 $ 43,714 $ 49,076 Repayments of long-term debt ( 2,937 ) — ( 2,937 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 3,125 ( 3,125 ) — Other 3 370 373 Balances as of July 31, 2020 $ 5,553 $ 40,959 $ 46,512 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company measures the fair value of equity investments (primarily its investment in JD.com) on a recurring basis and records them in other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the Company's equity investments are as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of July 31, 2020 Fair Value as of January 31, 2020 Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs $ 4,689 $ 2,715 Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs 5,204 2,723 Total $ 9,893 $ 5,438 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of July 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020 , the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: July 31, 2020 January 31, 2020 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 4,000 $ 205 (1) $ 4,000 $ 97 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges 3,500 471 (1) 3,750 455 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 4,271 ( 748 ) (2) 4,067 ( 696 ) (2) Total $ 11,771 $ ( 72 ) $ 11,817 $ ( 144 ) (1) Classified in Other long-term assets within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Classified in Deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements as of July 31, 2020 . Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. 11 Table of Contents The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of July 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020 , are as follows: July 31, 2020 January 31, 2020 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 46,512 $ 58,357 $ 49,076 $ 57,769 Note 6. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ASDA Equal Value Claims ASDA Stores Ltd. (""Asda""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over 40,000 equal value (""Equal Value"") claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the ""Employment Tribunal"") in the United Kingdom (""U.K."") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. Asda appealed the ruling and the oral argument was held before the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in July 2020. The Company is awaiting a decision. Notwithstanding the appeal, claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. Prescription Opiate Litigation and Other Matters In December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. 12 Table of Contents Note 7. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Beginning with the first quarter in fiscal 2021, the Company revised its definition of eCommerce net sales to include certain pharmacy transactions and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts to maintain comparability. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 93,282 $ 85,200 $ 182,025 $ 165,544 Walmart International 27,167 29,139 56,933 57,914 Sam's Club 16,375 15,049 31,538 28,879 Net sales $ 136,824 $ 129,388 $ 270,496 $ 252,337 Operating income by segment, as well as operating loss for corporate and support, interest, net and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 5,057 $ 4,659 $ 9,359 $ 8,801 Walmart International 812 893 1,618 1,631 Sam's Club 592 480 1,086 931 Corporate and support ( 402 ) ( 449 ) ( 780 ) ( 835 ) Operating income 6,059 5,583 11,283 10,528 Interest, net 635 585 1,184 1,210 Other (gains) and losses ( 3,222 ) 85 ( 3,943 ) ( 752 ) Income before income taxes $ 8,646 $ 4,913 $ 14,042 $ 10,070 13 Table of Contents Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or by market. From time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category. When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021 "") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2020 , the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2020 . We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally and those initiated through mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates . We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events and global health epidemics including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "" Item 5. Other Information ."" 15 Table of Contents COVID-19 Updates Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture, become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. These areas of focus are fundamental in running our business every day, and even more so now as Walmart plays an important role during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Supporting our associates. We remain focused on our strategy while also prioritizing the physical safety, financial health and emotional well-being of our associates. In the U.S., we provided extra pay and benefits, including special cash bonuses to store associates and the introduction of a COVID-19 Emergency Leave Policy. We have also done similar things in some of our international markets to support and reward associates. Serving our customers. From an operational standpoint, stores continued to operate at reduced hours to allow for additional cleaning and sanitizing, posted social-distancing decals, implemented protocols for temperature checks, began metering the number of customers in a store or club at any one time, and installed sneeze guards at pharmacies and checkouts. Stores, clubs, and facilities received masks and gloves, and associates and customers are required to wear face coverings to protect both associates and our customers. Globally, we hired more than 500,000 associates through August 2020, many of whom are temporary. Helping others. We increased our giving to community organizations and continued food donations from our stores and distribution centers. We supported tenants in various markets by waiving or discounting rent for in-store tenants during April 2020, which continued through May 2020. Managing the business and driving our long-term strategy. As we take care of associates, customers and communities, we continue to manage the business and drive our long-term strategy. We are maintaining our everyday low-price discipline and our omni-channel offering continues to resonate with customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in broad challenges globally in the first half fiscal 2021, including new and varying government regulations, stretching our supply chain, and introducing significant sales volatility as well as channel and mix shifts due to changing consumer habits. Increased demand led to strong growth in net sales, including eCommerce growth acceleration, and higher operating expenses during the six months ended July 31, 2020. Although gross margin rates were flat for the six months ended July 31, 2020, gross margin rates significantly improved in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID–19 pandemic; the duration and extent of economic stimulus; the length and impact of any stay–at–home orders or government mandates; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which will impact our results in the short term. In the current environment, we believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. See ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" for additional information. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. The COVID-19 pandemic led to increased demand and overall net sales growth through the first two quarters of fiscal 2021. As our Company continues to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized our focus on associate care, including extra pay and benefits as well as masks and gloves; increased cleaning and sanitation measures; customer safety; and new associate hiring. Additionally, we've reduced capital spending, delayed certain consulting projects, and reduced marketing and travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 16 Table of Contents Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019 , were as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 9.7 % 2.9 % (0.2 )% 0.0 % 10.1 % 3.1 % (0.3 )% 0.0 % Sam's Club 8.8 % 1.7 % (4.7 )% 0.6 % 9.2 % 1.6 % (4.0 )% 0.8 % Total U.S. 9.6 % 2.7 % (0.8 )% 0.0 % 10.0 % 2.8 % (0.7 )% 0.0 % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 9.6% and 10.0% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 9.7% and 10.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a decline in transactions as customers consolidated shopping trips. With the shift in purchasing behavior, Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 6.0% and 5.0% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, and was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery and walmart.com. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment were 8.8% and 9.2% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively. The Sam's Club segment's comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower fuel sales and our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.0% and 1.9% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively. Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net sales $ 136,824 $ 129,388 $ 270,496 $ 252,337 Percentage change from comparable period 5.7 % 1.8 % 7.2 % 1.5 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 28,994 $ 26,871 $ 56,366 $ 52,817 Percentage change from comparable period 7.9 % 0.6 % 6.7 % 0.5 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.2 % 20.8 % 20.8 % 20.9 % Despite the increase in net sales from the strong demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic for the three months ended July 31, 2020 , operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 42 basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily the result of $1.5 billion of incremental expenses related to associate care and customer safety during the COVID-19 pandemic which included special bonuses, additional cleaning and supplies, emergency leave pay and other similar charges, as well as a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in Walmart U.S. For the six months ended July 31, 2020 we leveraged operating expenses, decreasing operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 9 basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The primary driver of the expense leverage was due to our growth in comparable store sales driven by strong demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by $2.4 billion of incremental expenses described above during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in Walmart U.S. 17 Table of Contents Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. In recent years, we have allocated more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings. We will continue to remain disciplined with our capital spending in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Total capital expenditures for the six months ended July 31, 2020 decreased compared to the prior year due to the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted the timing of store remodeling and front-end technology transformation activities in Walmart U.S.; the following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Six Months Ended July 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2020 2019 eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other $ 1,814 $ 2,327 Store remodels 822 1,310 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 43 41 Total U.S. 2,679 3,678 Walmart International 890 1,193 Total Capital Expenditures $ 3,569 $ 4,871 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 7.7% and 6.0% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily driven by the change in fair value of the investment in JD.com, partially offset by the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart. ROI was 13.5% and 14.3% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart. We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. For the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2019 , lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of that balance sheet date, rather than averaged, because they are not directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8. A two-point average was used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (""ASU 2016-02""). Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI . 18 Table of Contents The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 18,128 $ 13,216 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 236,122 $ 220,462 Return on assets (ROA) 7.7 % 6.0 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 21,323 $ 21,581 + Interest income 151 227 + Depreciation and amortization 11,113 10,782 + Rent 2,679 2,809 = ROI operating income $ 35,266 $ 35,399 Denominator Average total assets (1),(2) $ 236,122 $ 227,557 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1), (2) 93,418 86,003 - Average accounts payable (1) 46,099 44,500 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 22,230 21,769 = Average invested capital $ 261,211 $ 247,291 Return on investment (ROI) 13.5 % 14.3 % As of July 31, 2020 2019 2018 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 237,382 $ 234,861 $ 206,062 Leased assets, net NP 21,188 6,998 Total assets without leased assets, net NP 213,673 199,064 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 97,023 89,813 84,052 Accumulated amortization on leased assets NP 3,686 5,547 Accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets NP 86,127 78,505 Accounts payable 46,326 45,871 43,128 Accrued liabilities 23,768 20,691 22,846 1 The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the corresponding prior period and dividing by 2. Average total assets as used in ROA includes the average impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02. 2 For the twelve months ended July 31, 2019, as a result of adopting ASU 2016-02, average total assets is based on the average of total assets without leased assets, net plus leased assets, net as of July 31, 2019. Average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets plus accumulated amortization on leased assets as of July 31, 2019. NP = Not provided 19 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $19.0 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 , which increased when compared to $11.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments . We generated free cash flow of $15.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 , which increased when compared to $6.3 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 due to the same reasons as the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $1.3 billion in decreased capital expenditures due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted the timing of store remodeling and front-end technology transformation activities in Walmart U.S. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 18,956 $ 11,185 Payments for property and equipment (3,569 ) (4,871 ) Free cash flow $ 15,387 $ 6,314 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (3,634 ) $ (3,824 ) Net cash used in financing activities (7,814 ) (5,531 ) (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Total revenues $ 137,742 $ 130,377 $ 272,364 $ 254,302 Percentage change from comparable period 5.6 % 1.8 % 7.1 % 1.4 % Net sales $ 136,824 $ 129,388 $ 270,496 $ 252,337 Percentage change from comparable period 5.7 % 1.8 % 7.2 % 1.5 % Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 9.6 % 2.7 % 10.0 % 2.8 % Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 24.9 % 24.3 % 24.3 % 24.3 % Operating income $ 6,059 $ 5,583 $ 11,283 $ 10,528 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.4 % 4.3 % 4.2 % 4.2 % Other (gains) and losses $ (3,222 ) $ 85 $ (3,943 ) $ (752 ) Consolidated net income $ 6,439 $ 3,680 $ 10,513 $ 7,586 Unit counts at period end 11,496 11,389 11,496 11,389 Retail square feet at period end 1,127 1,127 1,127 1,127 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $7.4 billion or 5.6% and $18.1 billion or 7.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenue were due to increases in net sales, which were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments resulting from strong demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with positive comparable sales in majority of our international markets, despite operating limitations in several markets due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 billion and $3.7 billion negative impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread to the U.S in late February, we saw the mix of sales shift heavily toward food and consumables as consumers initiated stock-up trips. Toward the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and throughout the second quarter of fiscal 2021, sales increased in several general merchandise categories which were heavily influenced by stimulus dollars in the U.S. eCommerce sales remained strong throughout the first half of fiscal 2021 as more customers gravitated toward and continued using store pickup and delivery. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") increased 63 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily the result of strong sales in higher-margin general merchandise categories, which in the U.S. was aided by government stimulus, lower markdowns, and better fuel margins. The gross profit rate was flat for the six months ended July 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in the gross profit rate for the three months ended July 31, 2020 , as described above, was offset in the Walmart U.S. segment by carryover of prior year price investments as well the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the increase in net sales, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 42 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily due to $1.5 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 9 basis points for the six months ended July 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales, partially offset by $2.4 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge in the Walmart U.S. segment. Other gains and losses consisted of a gain of $3.2 billion and a loss of $0.1 billion for the three months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively, and a gain of $3.9 billion and $0.8 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively, primarily representing the fair value change of our JD.com investment. Our effective income tax rate was 25.5% and 25.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, compared to 25.1% and 24.7% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. 21 Table of Contents As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $2.27 and $3.67 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, which represents an increase of $1.01 and $1.08 when compared to the same periods, respectively, in the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net sales $ 93,282 $ 85,200 $ 182,025 $ 165,544 Percentage change from comparable period 9.5 % 2.9 % 10.0 % 3.1 % Calendar comparable sales increase 9.7 % 2.9 % 10.1 % 3.1 % Operating income $ 5,057 $ 4,659 $ 9,359 $ 8,801 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.4 % 5.5 % 5.1 % 5.3 % Unit counts at period end 4,754 4,759 4,754 4,759 Retail square feet at period end 703 704 703 704 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $8.1 billion or 9.5% and $16.5 billion or 10.0% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to comparable sales of 9.7% and 10.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from increased demand due to economic conditions and government stimulus initiatives related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Customers continued consolidating shopping trips and purchasing larger baskets which contributed to the growth in average ticket while transactions decreased. Stimulus funds resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic tapered off contributing to slower growth in comparable sales towards the end of the second quarter. With the shift in purchasing behavior, Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 6.0% and 5.0% to comparable sales during the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, and was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery and walmart.com. Gross profit rate increased 42 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to increased sales of higher-margin general merchandise categories, fewer markdowns, and improvements in walmart.com's contribution to gross margin rates. Gross profit rate decreased 33 basis points for the six months ended July 31, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to carryover of prior year price investments as well the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the gross profit rate increase during the three months ended July 31, 2020 . Despite the increase in net sales, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 41 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily due to $1.2 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including special bonuses for store associates, additional costs associated with outfitting our associates with masks and gloves, expanded cleaning practices, and expanded sick and emergency leave pay, as well as a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge resulting from changes to Walmart U.S. support teams to better support its omni-channel strategy. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 22 basis points for the six months ended July 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales, which were partially offset by $1.9 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the $0.4 billion business restructuring charge described above. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net sales $ 27,167 $ 29,139 $ 56,933 $ 57,914 Percentage change from comparable period (6.8 )% (1.1 )% (1.7 )% (3.0 )% Operating income $ 812 $ 893 $ 1,618 $ 1,631 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.0 % 3.1 % 2.8 % 2.8 % Unit counts at period end 6,143 6,031 6,143 6,031 Retail square feet at period end 344 343 344 343 Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $2.0 billion or 6.8% and $1.0 billion or 1.7% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases were primarily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $2.4 billion and $3.7 billion for the three and six months 22 Table of Contents ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, which were partially offset by positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in March, we experienced significant economic pressure, channel shift and mix shifts in our major markets as customers focused on pantry stock-ups and reduced purchases of non-essential products. Through April and into May, we experienced extensive store and operational closures in several markets such as India, South Africa and Central America as government mandates limited or restricted the sale of certain products. By the end of the second quarter, most of our closed stores and warehouses had resumed operations. Gross profit rate increased 74 and 39 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases in gross profit rate for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 were due to reduced fuel sales in the U.K. and limited operations in our Flipkart business during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 65 and 24 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, including additional costs related to customer and associate health as well as increased cleaning practices, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and bonuses for store associates. The incremental costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic were partially offset by the current period impact of a twelve-month property tax abatement in the U.K. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Including Fuel Net sales $ 16,375 $ 15,049 $ 31,538 $ 28,879 Percentage change from comparable period 8.8 % 1.8 % 9.2 % 1.6 % Calendar comparable sales increase 8.8 % 1.7 % 9.2 % 1.6 % Operating income $ 592 $ 480 $ 1,086 $ 931 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.6 % 3.2 % 3.4 % 3.2 % Unit counts at period end 599 599 599 599 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 15,264 $ 13,451 $ 29,333 $ 25,904 Percentage change from comparable period 13.5 % 1.2 % 13.2 % 0.9 % Operating income $ 527 $ 424 $ 925 $ 867 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.5 % 3.2 % 3.2 % 3.3 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $1.3 billion or 8.8% and $2.7 billion or 9.2% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.8% and 9.2% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and partially offset by lower fuel sales and our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.0% and 1.9% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively. Gross profit rate increased 105 basis points for the three months ended July 31, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to higher fuel margins, lower markdowns, and improvements in inventory losses. The increase in the gross profit rate for the three months ended July 31, 2020 , was partially offset by investments in price and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. Gross profit rate increased 64 basis points for the six months ended July 31, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to higher fuel margins, improvements in inventory losses, and reduction in the sale of tobacco, which has lower margins. The increase in the gross profit rates for the six months ended July 31, 2020 , was partially offset by investments in price and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. Membership and other incom e increased 4.0% and 4.8% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 were due to increases in total members, overall renewal rates, and Plus penetration rate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 23 Table of Contents Despite the increase in net sales from the strong demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 52 and 32 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily the result of $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, including additional costs such as special bonuses for club associates, expanded security and cleaning practices, outfitting our associates with masks and gloves, and expanded sick and emergency leave pay. Additionally, the increases in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales were affected by reduced fuel and tobacco sales. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $112 million and $155 million for the three and six months ended July 31, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. In the current environment, we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 18,956 $ 11,185 Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion and $11.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended July 31, 2020 , was primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell-through, as well as the timing and payment of inventory purchases, incremental COVID-19 related expenses and certain benefit payments . Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $16.9 billion and $9.3 billion at July 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. We maintained more cash at July 31, 2020 compared to July 31, 2019 in order to provide us with enhanced financial flexibility due to the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our working capital deficit was $17.0 billion at July 31, 2020 , which decreased when compared to $18.9 billion at July 31, 2019 . We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of July 31, 2020 and January 31, 2020 , cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $1.9 billion at July 31, 2020 , approximately $0.4 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net cash used in investing activities $ (3,634 ) $ (3,824 ) Net cash used in investing activities was $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $0.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 , primarily as a result of decreased capital expenditures, partially offset by lapping net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in Walmart Canada in fiscal 2020. 24 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net cash used in financing activities $ (7,814 ) $ (5,531 ) Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $7.8 billion and $5.5 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The increase is primarily due to the timing of issuances and repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by a reduction in share repurchases and short-term borrowings as we manage our financial position during the current economic environment. In April 2020, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion . In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at July 31, 2020 , all undrawn. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the six months ended July 31, 2020 : (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2020 $ 5,362 $ 43,714 $ 49,076 Repayments of long-term debt (2,937 ) — (2,937 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 3,125 (3,125 ) — Other 3 370 373 Balances as of July 31, 2020 $ 5,553 $ 40,959 $ 46,512 Dividends On February 18, 2020 , the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2021 annual dividend of $ 2.16 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $2.12 per share. For fiscal 2021 , the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.54 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 20, 2020 April 6, 2020 May 8, 2020 June 1, 2020 August 14, 2020 September 8, 2020 December 11, 2020 January 4, 2021 The dividend installments payable on April 6, 2020 and June 1, 2020 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the six months ended July 31, 2020 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of July 31, 2020 , authorization for $5.0 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. 25 Table of Contents We continue to review our share repurchase activity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the six months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019 : Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 Total number of shares repurchased 6.3 36.6 Average price paid per share $ 114.73 $ 101.26 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 723 $ 3,707 Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal increases in merchandise inventories, our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in the capital markets. We also have $15.0 billion in various committed lines of credit in the U.S., all of which currently remains undrawn. At July 31, 2020 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. Other Matters In Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies"" and appears in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "" Item 1. Financial Statements ,"" we discuss, under the sub-caption ""ASDA Equal Value Claims,"" certain existing employment claims against Asda including certain risks arising therefrom. In that Note 6 , we also discuss, under the sub-caption "" Prescription Opiate Litigation and Other Matters ,"" the Prescription Opiate Litigation and other matters, including certain risks arising therefrom. We also discuss various legal proceedings related to the ASDA Equal Value Claims, and the Prescription Opiate Litigation in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "" Item 1. Legal Proceedings ,"" under the sub-caption ""I. Supplemental Information."" The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or the market value of our investments. Our market risks at July 31, 2020 are similar to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 . The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 , as filed with the SEC on March 20, 2020, under the caption ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 26 Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 27 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption ""Item 1. Financial Statements,"" in Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies,"" under the sub-caption ""Legal Proceedings."" We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. ASDA Equal Value Claims : Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); and ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal). Prescription Opiate Litigation : In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of August 21, 2020; some cases are in the process of being transferred to the MDL or have remand motions pending. A trial is currently scheduled to begin on November 9, 2020 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid distribution claims. A trial is also currently scheduled to begin in the MDL in May 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing and distribution claims. There is one case in which the Company is named as a defendant that was remanded from the MDL court to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. In addition, there are over 200 state court cases pending as of August 21, 2020, some of which may be removed to federal court to seek MDL transfer. The case citations for the state court cases and other information are included on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-Q. II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS : The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company’s consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company’s money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas. The Company has also been responding to civil investigative demands from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission related to money transfers and the Company’s anti-fraud program. Due to the investigative stage of these matters, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigations by the governmental entities. While the Company does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In September 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified the Company that it initiated an administrative penalty action by issuing a Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order. The letter accompanying the Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order alleges that the Company distributed and/or sold three unregistered pesticide products from March to June, 2017. The EPA is seeking a penalty of $960,000. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for ensuring that a FIFRA-regulated product is properly registered prior to its sale. The Company is cooperating with the EPA. In January 2018, the Environmental Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuraduría Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of approximately $163,000 for the absence of an Environmental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company is challenging the fine. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. The Company is cooperating with the Municipality. 28 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 . The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions have had wide-ranging effects on our business and the global economy and have exacerbated the potential for certain risks identified in that disclosure, including, without limitation, risks related to the successful execution of our omni-channel strategy, operational risks associated with geo-political and catastrophic events, risks associated with our suppliers, reputational risks and risk associated with changes in and failure to comply with laws and regulations, to materially and adversely affect our financial performance. The financial impact to the Company of the COVID-19 pandemic during the six month period ended July 31, 2020 , as well as certain of the actions we have taken to protect the health and safety of our associates, customers, members and the communities we serve, are discussed in Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Given the uncertainty regarding the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effect in the U.S and the other markets we serve, there can be no assurance that the pandemic will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in the future. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the six months ended July 31, 2020 , were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of July 31, 2020 , authorization for $5 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended July 31, 2020 , was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) May 1 - 31, 2020 — $ — — $ 5.0 June 1 - 30, 2020 — — — 5.0 July 1 - 31, 2020 — — — 5.0 Total — — (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020 ""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of April related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions, including potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. Receivables In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2020 with no material impact to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for credit losses, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which also includes insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales, banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. 8 Table of Contents Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three months ended April 30, 2020 and 2019 . The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 4,074 $ 3,906 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest ( 84 ) ( 64 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 3,990 $ 3,842 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,831 2,869 Dilutive impact of share-based awards 18 17 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,849 2,886 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 1.41 $ 1.34 Diluted 1.40 1.33 Note 3.

Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation resulting from the disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant. 9 Table of Contents Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program. In April 2020, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364 -day revolving credit facility of $ 10.0 billion . In total, the Company had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15.0 billion at April 30, 2020 and January 31, 2020 , all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the three months ended April 30, 2020 : (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2020 $ 5,362 $ 43,714 $ 49,076 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — — — Repayments of long-term debt — — — Reclassifications of long-term debt 622 ( 622 ) — Other ( 1 ) ( 86 ) ( 87 ) Balances as of April 30, 2020 $ 5,983 $ 43,006 $ 48,989 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company measures the fair value of equity investments (primarily its investment in JD.com) on a recurring basis and records them in other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the Company's investment in JD.com is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of April 30, 2020 Fair Value as of January 31, 2020 Investment in JD.com measured using Level 1 inputs $ 3,105 $ 2,715 Investment in JD.com measured using Level 2 inputs 3,115 2,723 Total $ 6,220 $ 5,438 Derivatives The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of April 30, 2020 and January 31, 2020 , the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: April 30, 2020 January 31, 2020 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 4,000 $ 201 (1) $ 4,000 $ 97 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges 3,750 593 (1) 3,750 455 (1) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 3,966 ( 1,155 ) (2) 4,067 ( 696 ) (2) Total $ 11,716 $ ( 361 ) $ 11,817 $ ( 144 ) (1) Classified in Other long-term assets within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) Classified in Deferred income taxes and other within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements as of April 30, 2020 . Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. 10 Table of Contents The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of April 30, 2020 and January 31, 2020 , are as follows: April 30, 2020 January 31, 2020 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 48,989 $ 58,437 $ 49,076 $ 57,769 Note 6. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ASDA Equal Value Claims ASDA Stores Ltd. (""Asda""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over 35,000 equal value (""Equal Value"") claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the ""Employment Tribunal"") in the United Kingdom (""UK"") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. Asda appealed the ruling and the appeal is scheduled to be heard by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom beginning on July 14, 2020. Notwithstanding the appeal, claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. Prescription Opiate Litigation and Other Matters In December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804), is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. 11 Table of Contents Note 7. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Beginning with the first quarter in fiscal 2021, the Company revised its definition of eCommerce net sales to include certain pharmacy transactions and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts to maintain comparability. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 88,743 $ 80,344 Walmart International 29,766 28,775 Sam's Club 15,163 13,830 Net sales $ 133,672 $ 122,949 Operating income by segment, as well as operating loss for corporate and support, interest, net and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 4,302 $ 4,142 Walmart International 806 738 Sam's Club 494 451 Corporate and support ( 378 ) ( 386 ) Operating income 5,224 4,945 Interest, net 549 625 Other (gains) and losses ( 721 ) ( 837 ) Income before income taxes $ 5,396 $ 5,157 12 Table of Contents Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or market. From time to time, the Company revises the assignment of net sales of a particular item to a merchandise category. When the assignment changes, previous period amounts are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021 (""fiscal 2021 "") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2020 , the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2020 . We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally and those initiated through mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period’s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates . We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events and global health epidemics including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under "" Item 5. Other Information ."" 14 Table of Contents COVID-19 Updates Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture, become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. These areas of focus are fundamental in running our business every day, and even more so now as Walmart plays an important role during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Supporting our associates. We remain focused on our strategy while also prioritizing the physical safety, financial health and emotional well-being of our associates. In the U.S., we provided extra pay and benefits, including the payment of a special cash bonus to hourly associates in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and the introduction of a COVID-19 Emergency Leave Policy. In May 2020, we announced a second special cash bonus to be paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We have also done similar things in some of our international markets to support and reward associates. Serving our customers. From an operational standpoint, we reduced store hours to allow for additional cleaning and sanitizing, posted social-distancing decals, implemented protocols for temperature checks, began metering the number of customers in a store or club at any one time, and installed sneeze guards at pharmacies and checkouts. Stores, clubs, and facilities received masks and gloves, and associates are required to wear face coverings to protect both our associates and our customers. We hired more than 300,000 associates through May 2020 in the U.S., many of whom are temporary. Helping others. We increased our giving to community organizations as well as continuing food donations from our stores and distribution centers. We supported tenants in various markets by waiving or discounting rent for in-store tenants during April 2020, which continued through May 2020. We have also made financial support available to our suppliers. Managing the business and driving our long-term strategy. As we take care of associates, customers and communities, we continue to manage the business and drive our long-term strategy. We are maintaining our everyday low-price discipline and our omni-channel offering continues to resonate with customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in broad challenges globally in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, including new and varying government regulations, stretching our supply chain, and introducing significant sales volatility as well as channel and mix shifts due to changing consumer habits. Unprecedented demand led to strong growth in net sales, but lower gross margin rates and higher operating expenses during the quarter. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "" Results of Operations "" below. We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the COVID–19 pandemic; the length and impact of stay–at–home orders; the scale and duration of economic stimulus; and volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence which will impact our results in the short term. In the current environment, we believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. See ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" for additional information. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. The COVID-19 pandemic affected our business resulting in sales volatility within the first quarter and overall net sales growth. As our Company continues to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized our focus on associate care, including extra pay and benefits as well as masks and gloves; increased cleaning and sanitation measures; customer safety; and new associate hiring. Additionally, we've delayed certain consulting projects and reduced marketing and travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 15 Table of Contents Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three months ended April 30, 2020 and 2019 , were as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 10.6 % 3.3 % (0.2 )% — % Sam's Club 9.6 % 1.4 % (3.4 )% 0.9 % Total U.S. 10.5 % 3.0 % (0.6 )% 0.1 % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 10.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 10.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2020 driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from unprecedented demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a decline in transactions as customers consolidated shopping trips. With the shift in purchasing behavior, Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 4.0% to comparable sales for the three months ended April 30, 2020 and was primarily driven from online grocery and walmart.com. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment were 9.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2020 . The Sam's Club segment's comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and lower fuel sales. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.7% to comparable sales for the three months ended April 30, 2020 . Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net sales $ 133,672 $ 122,949 Percentage change from comparable period 8.7 % 1.1 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 27,372 $ 25,946 Percentage change from comparable period 5.5 % 0.5 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 20.5 % 21.1 % For the three months ended April 30, 2020 we leveraged operating expenses, decreasing operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 62 basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, respectively. The primary driver of the expense leverage for the three months ended April 30, 2020 was due to our growth in comparable store sales driven by unprecedented demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which was partially offset by approximately $0.9 billion of incremental expenses to focus on associate care and customer safety during the COVID-19 pandemic which included bonuses, additional cleaning and supplies, emergency leave pay and other similar charges. 16 Table of Contents Strategic Capital Allocation Our strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers. In recent years, we have allocated more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings. We will continue to remain disciplined with our capital spending in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Total capital expenditures for three months ended April 30, 2020 decreased compared to the prior year; the following table provides additional detail: (Amounts in millions) Three Months Ended April 30, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2020 2019 eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other $ 823 $ 1,003 Store remodels 438 595 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 23 23 Total U.S. 1,284 1,621 Walmart International 468 584 Total capital expenditures $ 1,752 $ 2,205 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.6% and 4.0% for the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income as a result of lapping the $4.5 billion net loss in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and the change in fair value of the investment in JD.com, partially offset by the dilution to operating income related to Flipkart and business restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2020. ROI was 13.4% and 14.5% for the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to the decrease in operating income as a result of the dilution from Flipkart and business restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2020, as well as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart . We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. For the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2019 , lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of that balance sheet date, rather than averaged, because they are not directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8. A two-point average was used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI 17 Table of Contents The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 15,369 $ 8,809 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 233,718 $ 219,736 Return on assets (ROA) 6.6 % 4.0 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 20,847 $ 21,748 + Interest income 184 222 + Depreciation and amortization 11,062 10,714 + Rent 2,694 2,866 = Adjusted operating income $ 34,787 $ 35,550 Denominator Average total assets (1),(2) $ 233,718 $ 226,465 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1), (2) 90,970 84,960 - Average accounts payable (1) 44,603 44,861 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 20,700 20,903 = Average invested capital $ 259,385 $ 245,661 Return on investment (ROI) 13.4 % 14.5 % As of April 30, 2020 2019 2018 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 232,892 $ 234,544 $ 204,927 Leased assets, net NP 20,637 NP Total assets without leased assets, net NP 213,907 NP Accumulated depreciation and amortization 94,514 87,426 84,964 Accumulated amortization on leased assets NP 3,085 NP Accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets NP 84,341 NP Accounts payable 44,096 45,110 44,612 Accrued liabilities 20,377 21,023 20,782 (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the corresponding prior period and dividing by 2.

Average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets plus accumulated amortization on leased assets as of April 30, 2019. NP = Not provided 18 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $7.0 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , which increased when compared to $3.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 due to the accelerated timing of inventory sell-through in the current period primarily related to the impacts of COVID-19, as well as the timing of vendor and other payments. We generated free cash flow of $5.3 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , which increased when compared to $1.4 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 due to the same reasons as the increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.5 billion in decreased capital expenditures . Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,017 $ 3,563 Payments for property and equipment (1,752 ) (2,205 ) Free cash flow $ 5,265 $ 1,358 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (1,696 ) $ (1,135 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 565 (846 ) (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 19 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 Total revenues $ 134,622 $ 123,925 Percentage change from comparable period 8.6 % 1.0 % Net sales $ 133,672 $ 122,949 Percentage change from comparable period 8.7 % 1.1 % Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 10.5 % 3.0 % Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 23.7 % 24.3 % Operating income $ 5,224 $ 4,945 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.9 % 4.0 % Other (gains) and losses $ (721 ) $ (837 ) Consolidated net income $ 4,074 $ 3,906 Unit counts at period end 11,484 11,368 Retail square feet at period end 1,128 1,128 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $10.7 billion or 8.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in revenue was due to an increase in net sales, which were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments resulting from unprecedented demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our International markets, despite operating limitations in some markets due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Net sales were also positively affected by an extra day in February 2020 due to a leap year which increased net sales by approximately 1%. These increases were partially offset by a $1.3 billion negative impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three months ended April 30, 2020 . As the COVID-19 pandemic spread to the U.S in late February, we saw the mix of sales shift heavily toward food and consumables as consumers initiated stock-up trips. As the first quarter of fiscal 2021 progressed, we started to see pockets of strength in several general merchandise categories as consumers adapted to spending more time at home. Toward the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, sales increased in several general merchandise categories, such as apparel, electronics, sporting goods, and toys, which were heavily influenced by stimulus dollars in the U.S. in April. eCommerce sales remained strong throughout the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as more customers gravitated toward store pickup and delivery. Our gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") decreased 66 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily the result of a carryover of prior year price investments and unfavorable shifts in category and channel mix in our Walmart U.S. segment due to changes in consumer spending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 62 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to strong sales growth, which was partially offset by approximately $0.9 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a special bonus for store associates, additional costs associated with outfitting our associates with masks and gloves as well as expanded cleaning practices, and expanded sick and emergency leave pay. Other gains and losses consisted of a gain of $0.7 billion and $0.8 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, primarily representing the fair value change of our JD.com investment. Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2020 compared to 24.3% for the same period in the previous fiscal year. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $0.2 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $1.40 for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , which represents an increase of $0.07 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. 20 Table of Contents Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 Net sales $ 88,743 $ 80,344 Percentage change from comparable period 10.5 % 3.3 % Calendar comparable sales increase 10.6 % 3.3 % Operating income $ 4,302 $ 4,142 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.8 % 5.2 % Unit counts at period end 4,753 4,763 Retail square feet at period end 703 704 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $8.4 billion or 10.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was due to comparable sales of 10.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , driven by growth in average ticket . In late February through March, customers consolidated shopping trips and purchased larger baskets in stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which drove growth in average ticket while transactions decreased. While store sales slowed the first two weeks of April, beginning in mid-April, sales re-accelerated across the segment as government stimulus reached consumers. Store traffic was more volatile during the quarter due to the various stay-in-place orders and social distancing around the country. With the shift in purchasing behavior, Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 4.0% to comparable sales during the three months ended April 30, 2020 , and was primarily driven by online grocery and walmart.com. Gross profit rate decreased 113 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Carryover of prior year price investments, category and channel mix shifts, seasonal markdowns, and the temporary closure of our Auto Care Centers and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic pressured the gross profit rate. Category mix shifts included increased sales in lower margin categories such as food and consumables and softer sales in higher-margin categories such as apparel. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 89 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales, which were partially offset by approximately $0.7 billion of incremental costs related to the health crisis, including a special bonus for store associates, additional costs associated with outfitting our associates with masks and gloves as well as expanded cleaning practices, and expanded sick and emergency leave pay. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.2 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 Net sales $ 29,766 $ 28,775 Percentage change from comparable period 3.4 % (4.9 )% Operating income $ 806 $ 738 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.7 % 2.6 % Unit counts at period end 6,132 6,006 Retail square feet at period end 345 344 Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $1.0 billion or 3.4% for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets driven by a change in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in net sales was partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $1.3 billion . With the exception of Canada, all international markets report on a one-month lag. Beginning in March, we experienced significant economic pressure, channel shift and mix shifts in our major markets as customers focused on pantry stock-ups and reduced purchases of non-essential products. Towards the end of March, we also experienced reduced store operating hours, an increase in government regulations limiting purchases of non-essential products and closed stores and warehouses. Gross profit rate increased 10 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in gross profit rate for the three months ended April 30, 2020 was primarily due to Flipkart, partially offset by a change in mix towards lower margin categories and formats in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 21 Table of Contents Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 12 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease for the three months ended April 30, 2020 was primarily due to our growth in comparable store sales described above, which was partially offset by approximately $0.1 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including expanded sick and emergency leave pay, bonuses for store associates, and additional costs associated with outfitting our associates with masks and gloves and expanded cleaning practices. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.1 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Because all of our international markets except Canada report on a one-month lag, the COVID-19 related impacts described above are expected to be more significant in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2020 2019 Including Fuel Net sales $ 15,163 $ 13,830 Percentage change from comparable period 9.6 % 1.5 % Calendar comparable sales increase 9.6 % 1.4 % Operating income $ 494 $ 451 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.3 % 3.3 % Unit counts at period end 599 599 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 14,069 $ 12,453 Percentage change from comparable period 13.0 % 0.6 % Operating income $ 398 $ 443 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.8 % 3.6 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $1.3 billion or 9.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2020 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 9.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2020 . Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and lower fuel sales. In February and through March, strong traffic in clubs was driven by COVID-19 stock up trips. In April, traffic slowed as members consolidated trips and increased their average ticket size. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.7% to comparable sales for the three months ended April 30, 2020 . Gross profit rate increased 20 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The gross profit rate increased from higher fuel margins and a reduction in tobacco sales. The increase in the gross profit rate was partially offset by investments in price, and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. Membership and other incom e increased 5.6% for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase for the three months ended April 30, 2020 was due to an increase in total members, Plus penetration rate, and overall renewal rates as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 10 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily the result of approximately $0.1 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional costs associated with outfitting our associates with masks and gloves and expanded cleaning practices, a special bonus for club associates, and expanded sick and emergency leave pay . Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $43 million for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. In the current environment, we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,017 $ 3,563 Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.0 billion and $3.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to the accelerated timing of inventory sell-through in the current period primarily related to the impacts of COVID-19, as well as the timing of vendor and other payments. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $14.9 billion and $9.3 billion at April 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. We maintained more cash at April 30, 2020 compared to April 30, 2019 in order to provide us with enhanced financial flexibility due to the uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our working capital deficit was $19.3 billion at April 30, 2020 , which increased when compared to $18.1 billion at April 30, 2019 . We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. As of April 30, 2020 and January 31, 2020 , cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.4 billion at April 30, 2020 , approximately $0.6 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,696 ) $ (1,135 ) Net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 billion and $1.1 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Net cash used in investing activities increased $0.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , primarily as a result of lapping net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in Walmart Canada in fiscal 2020, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures. Net Cash Provided by or Used in Financing Activities Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2020 2019 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 565 $ (846 ) Net cash provided by or used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $0.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , compared to net cash used in financing activities of $0.8 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 . The increase is primarily due to the net increase in short-term borrowings and a reduction in share repurchases as compared to the prior year. The increase was partially offset by the issuance of long term debt in the prior year to fund general business operations. In April 2020, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion . In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at April 30, 2020 , all undrawn. 23 Table of Contents Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the three months ended April 30, 2020 : (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2020 $ 5,362 $ 43,714 $ 49,076 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — — — Repayments of long-term debt $ — $ — $ — Reclassifications of long-term debt 622 (622 ) — Other $ (1 ) $ (86 ) $ (87 ) Balances as of April 30, 2020 $ 5,983 $ 43,006 $ 48,989 Dividends On February 18, 2020 , the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2021 annual dividend of $ 2.16 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $2.12 per share. For fiscal 2021 , the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.54 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 20, 2020 April 6, 2020 May 8, 2020 June 1, 2020 August 14, 2020 September 8, 2020 December 11, 2020 January 4, 2021 The dividend installments payable on April 6, 2020 and June 1, 2020 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended April 30, 2020 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of April 30, 2020 , authorization for $5.0 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. We are prudently managing our share repurchases in order to maintain a strong balance sheet in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the three months ended April 30, 2020 and 2019 : Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 Total number of shares repurchased $ 6.3 $ 21.7 Average price paid per share $ 114.73 $ 98.22 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 723 $ 2,135 Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal increases in merchandise inventories, our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in the capital markets. We also have $15.0 billion in various committed lines of credit in the U.S., all of which currently remains undrawn. At April 30, 2020 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent 24 Table of Contents over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. Other Matters In Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies"" and appears in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "" Item 1. Financial Statements ,"" we discuss, under the sub-caption ""ASDA Equal Value Claims,"" certain existing employment claims against Asda including certain risks arising therefrom. In that Note 6 , we also discuss, under the sub-caption "" Prescription Opiate Litigation and Other Matters ,"" the Prescription Opiate Litigation and other matters, including certain risks arising therefrom. We also discuss various legal proceedings related to the ASDA Equal Value Claims, and the Prescription Opiate Litigation in Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "" Item 1. Legal Proceedings ,"" under the sub-caption ""I. Supplemental Information."" The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or the market value of our investments. Our market risks at April 30, 2020 are similar to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 . The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 , as filed with the SEC on March 20, 2020, under the caption ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 25 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption ""Item 1.

We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed. ASDA Equal Value Claims : Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); and ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal). Prescription Opiate Litigation : In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of May 27, 2020; some cases are in the process of being transferred to the MDL or have remand motions pending. A trial is currently scheduled to begin on November 9, 2020 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid distribution claims. A trial is also currently scheduled to begin in the MDL in May 2021 against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing and distribution claims. There is one case that was remanded from the MDL court to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. In addition, there are over 200 state court cases pending as of May 27, 2020, some of which may be removed to federal court to seek MDL transfer. The case citations for the state court cases and other information are included on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-Q. II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS : The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking documents regarding the Company’s consumer fraud program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company’s money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in January 2020. The Company has been responding to these subpoenas. The Company has also been responding to civil investigative demands from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission related to money transfers and the Company’s anti-fraud program. Due to the investigative stage of these matters, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigations by the governmental entities. While the Company does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In September 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified the Company that it initiated an administrative penalty action by issuing a Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order. The letter accompanying the Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order alleges that the Company distributed and/or sold three unregistered pesticide products from March to June, 2017. The EPA is seeking a penalty of $960,000. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for ensuring that a FIFRA-regulated product is properly registered prior to its sale. The Company is cooperating with the EPA. In January 2018, the Environmental Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuraduría Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of approximately $163,000 for the absence of an Environmental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company is challenging the fine. In April 2017, the California Air Resources Board (the ""ARB"") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimed deposits collected on sales of small containers of automotive refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs. The ARB alleged that the Company had improperly retained approximately $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and sought reimbursement. In May 2020, without any admission of wrongdoing, the Company and the ARB entered into a settlement pursuant to which Walmart agreed to pay $150,000 to the Car Care Council for the purpose of funding enhanced educational programs on measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of small containers of automotive refrigerant. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. The Company is cooperating with the Municipality. 26 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 . The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions have had wide-ranging effects on our business and the global economy and have exacerbated the potential for certain risks identified in that disclosure, including, without limitation, risks related to the successful execution of our omni-channel strategy, operational risks associated with geo-political and catastrophic events, risks associated with our suppliers, reputational risks and risk associated with changes in and failure to comply with laws and regulations, to materially and adversely affect our financial performance. The financial impact to the Company of the COVID-19 pandemic during the three month period ended April 30, 2020, as well as certain of the actions we have taken to protect the health and safety of our associates, customers, members and the communities we serve, are discussed in Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Given the uncertainty regarding the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effect in the U.S and the other markets we serve, there can be no assurance that the pandemic will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in the future. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended April 30, 2020 , were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of April 30, 2020 , authorization for 5 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended April 30, 2020 , was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) February 1 - 29, 2020 2,905,716 $ 115.11 2,905,716 $ 5.3 March 1 - 31, 2020 3,128,100 114.34 3,128,100 5.0 April 1 - 30, 2020 — — — 5.0 Total 6,033,816 6,033,816 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019 ""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of October related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Restricted Cash Restricted cash not classified as part of cash and cash equivalents was $ 25 million and $ 34 million as of October 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , respectively, and was primarily recorded in other long-term assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted cash not classified as part of cash and cash equivalents was $ 30 million and approximately $ 0.3 billion as of October 31, 2018 and January 31, 2018, respectively, and was primarily recorded in other long-term assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inventories At October 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet. The Company adopted this ASU and related amendments as of February 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach and elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to determine if they contain leases. For leases subject to index or rate adjustments, the most current index or rate adjustments were included in the measurement of operating lease obligations at adoption. The adoption of this ASU and related amendments resulted in a $ 14.8 billion increase to total assets and a $ 15.1 billion increase to total liabilities in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020""). In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $ 16.8 billion and $ 17.5 billion of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations, respectively, and removed $ 2.2 billion and $ 1.7 billion , respectively, of assets and liabilities related to financial obligations connected with the construction of leased stores. Several other asset and liability line items in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet were also impacted by immaterial amounts. Additionally, the adoption resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $ 0.3 billion , net of tax, which primarily consisted of the recognition of impairment. The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows were immaterially impacted. Updated accounting policies as a result of the adoption of this ASU are described below. Note 10 provides additional lease disclosures. For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company records right-of-use (""ROU"") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments. Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. 9 Table of Contents For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. Revenue Recognition Contract Balances Contract balances as a result of transactions with customers primarily consist of receivables included in receivables, net, and deferred gift card revenue included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table provides the Company's receivables and deferred gift card revenue from transactions with customers: (Amounts in millions) October 31, 2019 January 31, 2019 Assets: Receivables from transactions with customers, net $ 2,618 $ 2,538 Liabilities: Deferred gift card revenue $ 1,863 $ 1,932 Derivatives In fiscal 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities . The adoption of the standard had no current or historical impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company continues to use qualitative methods to assess the effectiveness of its designated hedging relationships. Upon adopting ASU 2017-12, the Company modified its existing hedge documentation to use a quantitative method for assessing effectiveness when the hedge is subsequently determined to be ineffective under the qualitative method. There were no other significant changes to the Company's accounting policies for derivatives. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2020. Management has substantially completed its evaluation of its existing financial instruments and does not expect the adoption of this ASU to materially impact the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards.

Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. that are used to support its commercial paper program. In total, the Company has committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15 billion at October 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 : (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2019 $ 1,876 $ 43,520 $ 45,396 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 5,492 5,492 Repayments of long-term debt ( 1,907 ) — ( 1,907 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 4,129 ( 4,129 ) — Other ( 5 ) 29 24 Balances as of October 31, 2019 $ 4,093 $ 44,912 $ 49,005 11 Table of Contents Debt Issuances Information on long-term debt issued during the nine months ended October 31, 2019 is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Issue Date Principal Amount Maturity Date Fixed vs. Floating Interest Rate Net Proceeds April 23, 2019 $ 1,500 July 8, 2024 Fixed 2.850 % $ 1,493 April 23, 2019 $ 1,250 July 8, 2026 Fixed 3.050 % 1,242 April 23, 2019 $ 1,250 July 8, 2029 Fixed 3.250 % 1,243 September 24, 2019 $ 500 September 24, 2029 Fixed 2.375 % 497 September 24, 2019 $ 1,000 September 24, 2049 Fixed 2.950 % 975 Various $ 42 Various Various Various 42 Total $ 5,492 These issuances, which are used for general corporate purposes, are senior, unsecured notes which rank equally with all other senior, unsecured debt obligations of the Company, and are not convertible or exchangeable. These issuances do not contain any financial covenants which restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase company stock. Maturities The following table provides details of debt repayments during the nine months ended October 31, 2019 : (Amounts in millions) Maturity Date Original Amount Fixed vs. Floating Interest Rate Repayment February 1, 2019 $ 500 Fixed 4.125 % $ 364 October 20, 2019 $ 300 Floating 2.281 % 300 October 20, 2019 $ 1,200 Fixed 1.750 % 1,200 Various $ 43 Various Various 43 Total repayment of matured debt $ 1,907 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. Recurring Fair Value Measurements The Company has equity investments, primarily its investment in JD.com, Inc. (""JD""), measured at fair value on a recurring basis included in other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: • The purchased portion of the investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs, and • The portion of the investment in JD received in exchange for selling certain assets related to Yihaodian, the Company's former eCommerce operations in China, measured using Level 2 inputs. Fair value is determined primarily using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets. 12 Table of Contents Information for the fair value of the Company's investment in JD is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of October 31, 2019 Fair Value as of January 31, 2019 Investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs $ 2,244 $ 1,791 Investment in JD measured using Level 2 inputs 2,249 1,792 Total $ 4,493 $ 3,583 The changes in fair value for the Company's investment in JD are included in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also holds derivative instruments. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest yield and foreign currency forward curves. As of October 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: October 31, 2019 January 31, 2019 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 4,000 $ 66 $ 4,000 $ ( 78 ) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges 3,750 440 2,250 334 Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 4,078 ( 658 ) 4,173 ( 272 ) Total $ 11,828 $ ( 152 ) $ 10,423 $ ( 16 ) Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. The Company recorded other immaterial impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 . As discussed in Note 8 , the Company met the criteria to recognize Walmart Brazil as held for sale in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Prior to meeting the held for sale criteria, the carrying values of the long-lived assets were concluded to be recoverable based upon cash flows expected to be generated over the assets' useful lives. When the sale of Walmart Brazil became probable, the Company reclassified the related assets and liabilities to held for sale and measured the disposal group at fair value, less costs to sell. The assets of the disposal group totaled $ 3.3 billion and were comprised of $ 1.0 billion in current assets, $ 1.6 billion in property and equipment and property under capital lease and financing obligations, net, and $ 0.7 billion of other long-term assets. These assets were fully impaired during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as the carrying value of the disposal group exceeded the fair value, less costs to sell. The Company recorded a pre-tax net loss in the Walmart International segment of approximately $ 4.8 billion during the nine months ended October 31, 2018, in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the sale was completed as discussed in Note 8 . Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of October 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , are as follows: October 31, 2019 January 31, 2019 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 49,005 $ 57,016 $ 45,396 $ 49,570 Note 6. Derivative Financial Instruments In connection with various derivative agreements, including master netting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $ 219 million and $ 220 million at October 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , respectively. Furthermore, as part of the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's net derivative liability position exceeds $ 150 million with such counterparties. The Company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at October 31, 2019 or January 31, 2019 . 13 Table of Contents At October 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , the Company had ¥ 180 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of £ 1.7 billion at October 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , that was designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to January 2039 . The Company's derivative instruments, as well as its nonderivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, were classified as follows in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: October 31, 2019 January 31, 2019 (Amounts in millions) Fair Value Instruments Net Investment Instruments Cash Flow Instruments Fair Value Instruments Net Investment Instruments Cash Flow Instruments Derivative instruments Derivative assets: Other long-term assets $ 67 $ 440 $ — $ — $ 334 $ 78 Derivative liabilities: Deferred income taxes and other $ 1 $ — $ 658 $ 78 $ — $ 350 Nonderivative hedging instruments: Long-term debt $ — $ 3,830 $ — $ — $ 3,863 $ — Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant. Note 7. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ASDA Equal Value Claims ASDA Stores Ltd. (""Asda""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over 30,000 equal value (""Equal Value"") claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the ""Employment Tribunal"") in the United Kingdom (""UK"") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. As a result, claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. In March 2015, Asda asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings and to ""strike out"" substantially all of the claims because the claimants had not adhered to the Tribunal's procedural rule for including multiple claimants on the same claim form. Ultimately, the Court of Appeals declined to strike out any claims relying on the Employment Tribunal’s finding that claimants had not deliberately disregarded the Tribunal’s procedural rule. As to the initial phase of the Equal Value claims, in October 2016 following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. Asda appealed the ruling and the appeal is currently pending before t he Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Notwithstanding the appeal, claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and no assurance to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. 14 Table of Contents National Prescription Opiate Litigation and Related Matters In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. FCPA Investigation and Related Matters As previously disclosed, the Company was under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") regarding possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA""). Throughout the investigative process, the Company cooperated with the DOJ and the SEC, and on June 20, 2019, the Company announced the resolution of the investigations with the DOJ and the SEC and paid $ 283 million in June 2019 consisting of a combination of penalties, disgorgement and interest as further described below (the ""Settlement Amount""). The Company previously recorded the Settlement Amount in the Company's fiscal 2018 consolidated financial statements in anticipated settlement of these matters. The resolution of the investigations with the DOJ and SEC included: 1. A non-prosecution agreement (the ""NPA"") between the DOJ and the Company for a three-year term. Pursuant to the NPA, the Company paid a $ 138 million penalty and agreed to maintain the Company's anti-corruption compliance program for three years, certain reporting obligations for three years, and a limited monitorship with a third party for two years regarding the Company's anti-corruption compliance program, with the possibility of a third year pending the results of the monitorship during the initial two-year period. The DOJ agreed that it will not prosecute the Company for any conduct described in the NPA provided that the Company performs its obligations under the NPA for the three-year term. 2. A plea agreement (the ""Plea Agreement"") entered into for a three-year term by the DOJ and WMT Brasilia S.a.r.l., an indirect wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of the Company (""WMT Brasilia"") that previously owned a majority stake of the Company's Brazilian business. Through the Plea Agreement, entered in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, WMT Brasilia pled guilty to one count of causing a books and records violation of the FCPA. The Company on behalf of WMT Brasilia was assessed a $ 4 million penalty, including forfeiture, that was deducted from the amount paid by the Company under the NPA. 3. A Cease-and-Desist Order entered into by the SEC in a civil administrative proceeding (the ""SEC Order""), the entry of which the Company consented to with respect to certain violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. The Company paid $ 145 million in disgorgement and interest, and agreed to make certain reports to the SEC on its anti-corruption compliance and remediation efforts for two years, and cease and desist any violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. On June 20, 2019, the Company also entered into an Administrative Agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the ""EPA"") for a three-year term, which replaces the interim administrative agreement between the Company and the EPA dated May 28, 2013. The May 28, 2013 agreement arose as part of a settlement by the Company regarding certain hazardous waste materials matters with several governmental authorities. The new EPA agreement, among other things, resolved any debarment or suspension as to participation in federal government programs by the Company due to the NPA, the Plea Agreement, and the SEC Order, provided that the Company fulfills the terms and conditions of the new EPA agreement, which requires reporting by the Company to the EPA periodically during the three-year term, and requires a new, limited two-year monitorship. The monitor referenced above that has been engaged by the Company under the NPA will also monitor compliance with the new EPA agreement. If the DOJ monitorship is extended as referenced above, the EPA monitorship may also be extended for an additional year. In addition, the Company expects to incur costs in implementing the settlement and may incur costs in responding to any new civil or regulatory actions. The Company does not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 15 Table of Contents Note 8. Disposals, Acquisitions, and Other Items The following disposals, acquisitions and other items relate to the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or have been announced. Walmart Brazil In August 2018, the Company sold an 80 percent stake of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (""Advent""). Under the terms, Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period, and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax net loss of $ 4.8 billion during the nine months ended October 31, 2018 in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. Substantially all of this charge was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 upon meeting the held for sale criteria, and an additional immaterial amount was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 upon closure of the sale. In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by $ 0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company indemnified Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$ 2.3 billion , adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. The Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. This equity method investment was determined to have no fair value and continues to have no carrying value. Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart"") In August 2018, the Company acquired 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace , for cash consideration of approximately $ 16 billion . The acquisition increased the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company finalized the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Flipkart acquisition as follows: • Assets of $ 24.1 billion , which is comprised primarily of $ 2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $ 2.8 billion in other current assets, $ 5.0 billion in intangible assets and $ 13.5 billion in goodwill. Of the intangible assets, $ 4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The remaining $ 0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily related to acquired technology with a life of 3 years. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consisted largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale primarily related to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes; • Liabilities of $ 3.7 billion , which is comprised primarily of $ 1.8 billion of current liabilities and $ 1.7 billion of deferred income taxes; and • Noncontrolling interest of $ 4.3 billion , for which the fair value was estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. Note 9. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil until the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil as discussed in Note 8 in August 2018. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. 16 Table of Contents The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 83,189 $ 80,583 $ 248,733 $ 241,146 Walmart International 29,167 28,793 87,081 88,507 Sam's Club 14,625 14,521 43,504 42,933 Net sales $ 126,981 $ 123,897 $ 379,318 $ 372,586 Operating income by segment, as well as operating loss for corporate and support, interest, net and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 4,176 $ 3,937 $ 12,977 $ 12,343 Walmart International 634 1,179 2,265 3,713 Sam's Club 327 379 1,258 1,106 Corporate and support ( 419 ) ( 509 ) ( 1,254 ) ( 1,272 ) Operating income 4,718 4,986 15,246 15,890 Interest, net 589 534 1,799 1,524 Other (gains) and losses ( 244 ) 1,876 ( 996 ) 8,570 Income before income taxes $ 4,373 $ 2,576 $ 14,443 $ 5,796 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or market. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order online and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

Note 11. Subsequent Event ASDA Group Pension Scheme In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the ""Plan"") entered into an agreement pursuant to which Asda made a cash contribution of $ 1.1 billion to the Plan which enabled the Plan to purchase a bulk insurance annuity contract for the benefit of Plan participants. The agreement between Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Plan contemplates that subsequent to the purchase of the bulk annuity insurance contract by the Plan, each of the Plan participants will be issued individual annuity contracts. The issuer of the individual annuity insurance contracts will be solely responsible for paying each participant’s benefits in full and will release the Plan and Asda from any future obligations. The Company expects the issuance of individual annuity contracts to the Plan participants to take place in late fiscal 2021 or early fiscal 2022, which will trigger a pension settlement that will result in all Plan balances, including accumulated pension components within other comprehensive income, being charged to expense. 19 Table of Contents Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020 "") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2019 , the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2019 incorporated by reference. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Beginning with the first quarter of the current fiscal year, we updated our definition of what was previously referred to as traffic (a component, along with ticket, of comparable sales). Traffic is now referred to as ""transactions"" and measures a percentage change in the number of sales transactions in our comparable stores, as well as for comparable eCommerce activity. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates . We recently took strategic actions to strengthen our portfolio for the long-term, including: • Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart"") in August 2018. Refer to Note 8 for additional information on the transaction. • Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (""Advent"") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019, substantially all of which was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 8 for additional information on the transaction. • Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile and Walmart Canada in December 2018 and April 2019, respectively. 20 Table of Contents • Entered into an agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 between Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the ""Plan"") pursuant to which Asda made a $1.1 billion cash contribution to the Plan. This cash contribution enabled the Plan to purchase a bulk insurance annuity contract for the benefit of Plan participants in anticipation that each Plan participant is issued individual annuity contracts. The issuer of the individual annuity insurance contracts will be solely responsible for paying each participant’s benefits in full and will release the Plan and Asda from any future obligations. Once Plan participants have been issued individual annuity contracts, we will recognize a total, pre-tax charge of approximately $2.2 billion related to the pension settlement in late fiscal 2021 or early fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on the transaction. The Retail Industry We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , were as follows: Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 3.3 % 3.4 % 0.0 % 0.1 % 3.1 % 3.5 % 0.0 % 0.1 % Sam's Club 0.6 % 5.4 % 0.1 % 2.1 % 1.3 % 6.1 % 0.6 % 2.1 % Total U.S. 2.9 % 3.7 % 0.0 % 0.4 % 2.8 % 3.9 % 0.0 % 0.4 % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 2.9% and 2.8% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 3.3% and 3.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, driven by growth in ticket and transactions . Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.7% and 1.5% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively. 21 Table of Contents Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment were 0.6% and 1.3% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively. The Sam's Club segment's comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and higher fuel sales, which were partially offset by lower ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.5% and 1.4% to comparable sales, respectively, for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 . Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net sales $ 126,981 $ 123,897 $ 379,318 $ 372,586 Percentage change from comparable period 2.5 % 1.4 % 1.8 % 3.3 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 27,373 $ 26,792 $ 80,190 $ 79,328 Percentage change from comparable period 2.2 % (0.3 )% 1.1 % 2.6 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.6 % 21.6 % 21.1 % 21.3 % For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 we leveraged operating expenses, decreasing operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 6 and 15 basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, respectively. The primary drivers of the expense leverage for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 were strong sales and productivity improvements in the Walmart U.S. segment partially offset by a $0.3 billion non-cash trade name impairment charge in the Walmart International segment. Strategic Capital Allocation We are allocating more capital to eCommerce, technology and supply chain as well as store remodels and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years. Our strategy includes initiatives to improve our customer proposition in stores and clubs and integrate our digital and physical shopping experience. As such, we have been allocating more capital in recent years to eCommerce, technology and supply chain, as well as store remodels, and less capital to new stores and clubs openings. The following table presents our capital allocation for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018: (Amounts in millions) Nine Months Ended October 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2019 2018 eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other $ 3,859 $ 3,355 Store remodels 1,855 1,734 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 67 230 Total U.S. 5,781 5,319 Walmart International 1,984 1,695 Total capital expenditures $ 7,765 $ 7,014 22 Table of Contents Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.3% and 2.6% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income over the trailing twelve months, primarily resulting from lapping the $4.5 billion net loss in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, the change in fair value of the investment in JD.com, and lapping the restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by the dilution to operating income related to Flipkart. ROI was 13.7% and 13.4% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The increase in ROI was due to the increase in operating income over the trailing twelve months primarily as a result of lapping the restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, offset by the dilution to operating income related to Flipkart. The denominator remained relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart was offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from the removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (""ASU 2016-02"") since operating lease right of use assets are now included in total assets . We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8 is no longer included in the calculation of ROI on a prospective basis as operating lease assets are now capitalized. For fiscal 2020, lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of the current balance sheet date, rather than averaged, because they are no longer directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8. A two-point average will be used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard. Further, beginning prospectively in fiscal 2020, rent expense in the numerator excludes short-term and variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the operating lease right-of-use asset balance. Prior to adoption of ASU 2016-02, we defined ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8, which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. Because the new lease standard was adopted under the modified retrospective approach as of February 1, 2019, our calculation of ROI for the comparable fiscal 2019 period was not revised. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. 23 Table of Contents The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 14,720 $ 5,729 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 233,207 $ 217,999 Return on assets (ROA) 6.3 % 2.6 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 21,313 $ 20,357 + Interest income 212 190 + Depreciation and amortization 10,889 10,649 + Rent 2,733 3,053 = Adjusted operating income $ 35,147 $ 34,249 Denominator Average total assets (1),(2) $ 240,261 $ 217,999 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1), (2) 87,982 84,136 - Average accounts payable (1) 49,740 48,658 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 21,884 22,276 + Rent x 8 N/A 24,424 = Average invested capital $ 256,619 $ 255,625 Return on investment (ROI) 13.7 % 13.4 % As of October 31, 2019 2018 2017 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 239,830 $ 226,583 $ 209,414 Leased assets, net 21,099 6,991 7,144 Total assets without leased assets, net 218,731 219,592 202,270 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 91,697 85,827 82,445 Accumulated amortization on leased assets 4,140 5,701 5,497 Accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets 87,557 80,126 76,948 Accounts payable 49,750 49,729 47,587 Accrued liabilities 20,973 22,795 21,757 (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the corresponding prior period and dividing by 2. Average total assets as used in ROA includes the average impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 . (2) For the twelve months ended October 31, 2019, as a result of adopting ASU 2016-02, average total assets is based on the average of total assets without leased assets, net plus leased assets, net as of October 31, 2019. Average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets plus accumulated amortization on leased assets as of October 31, 2019. 24 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $14.5 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , which decreased when compared to $17.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2018 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and U.S. associate payroll, as well as the inclusion of Flipkart operations . We generated free cash flow of $6.8 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , which decreased when compared to $10.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.8 billion in increased capital expenditures . Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,539 $ 17,308 Payments for property and equipment (7,765 ) (7,014 ) Free cash flow $ 6,774 $ 10,294 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (6,285 ) $ (20,554 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (7,213 ) 5,921 (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Total revenues $ 127,991 $ 124,894 $ 382,293 $ 375,612 Percentage change from comparable period 2.5 % 1.4 % 1.8 % 3.2 % Net sales $ 126,981 $ 123,897 $ 379,318 $ 372,586 Percentage change from comparable period 2.5 % 1.4 % 1.8 % 3.3 % Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 2.9 % 3.7 % 2.8 % 3.9 % Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 24.5 % 24.8 % 24.4 % 24.7 % Operating income $ 4,718 $ 4,986 $ 15,246 $ 15,890 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.7 % 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.3 % Other (gains) and losses $ (244 ) $ 1,876 $ (996 ) $ 8,570 Consolidated net income (loss) $ 3,321 $ 1,817 $ 10,907 $ 3,366 Unit counts at period end 11,438 11,277 11,438 11,277 Retail square feet at period end 1,128 1,125 1,128 1,125 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $3.1 billion or 2.5% and $6.7 billion or 1.8% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenues were due to increases in net sales, which were primarily due to overall positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments and the addition of net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in August 2018. These increases were partially offset by our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018 and a $1.0 billion and $4.2 billion negative impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively. Our gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") decreased 36 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. These decreases were primarily due to the addition of Flipkart in the Walmart International segment and price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment, partially offset by favorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 6 and 15 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 were strong sales and productivity improvements in the Walmart U.S. segment partially offset by a $0.3 billion non-cash trade name impairment charge in the Walmart International segment. Other gains and losses consisted of a gain of $0.2 billion and a loss of $1.9 billion for the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and consisted of a gain of $1.0 billion and a loss of $8.6 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The changes in other gains and losses for the three months ended October 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year is primarily due to the recognition of changes in fair value of our investment in JD.com. The change in other gains and losses for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year were primarily due to the $4.8 billion pre-tax loss related to the sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil and the recognition of changes in fair value of our investment in JD.com. Our effective income tax rate was 24.1% and 24.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, compared to 29.5% and 41.9% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year is primarily due to the changes in fair value of our investment in JD.com and the timing of the Flipkart acquisition. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , is primarily due to the sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which increased the comparative period's effective tax rate 17%, as it provided minimal realizable tax benefit. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $1.5 billion and $7.5 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $1.15 and $3.74 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, which represents an increase of $0.57 and $2.73 when compared to the same periods, respectively, in the previous fiscal year. 26 Table of Contents Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net sales $ 83,189 $ 80,583 $ 248,733 $ 241,146 Percentage change from comparable period 3.2 % 3.7 % 3.1 % 4.0 % Calendar comparable sales increase 3.3 % 3.4 % 3.1 % 3.5 % Operating income $ 4,176 $ 3,937 $ 12,977 $ 12,343 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.0 % 4.9 % 5.2 % 5.1 % Unit counts at period end 4,759 4,755 4,759 4,755 Retail square feet at period end 703 705 703 705 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $2.6 billion or 3.2% and $7.6 billion or 3.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to comparable sales of 3.3% and 3.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, driven by growth in ticket and transactions . Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.7% and 1.5% to comparable sales during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, and were primarily driven by online grocery. Gross profit rate decreased 4 and 7 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases were primarily the result of continued price investments which were partially offset by better merchandise mix, including strength in private brands, and less pressure from transportation costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 21 and 19 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales and productivity improvements, partially offset by the continued growth of eCommerce. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.2 billion and $0.6 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net sales $ 29,167 $ 28,793 $ 87,081 $ 88,507 Percentage change from comparable period 1.3 % (2.6 )% (1.6 )% 4.2 % Operating income $ 634 $ 1,179 $ 2,265 $ 3,713 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.2 % 4.1 % 2.6 % 4.2 % Unit counts at period end 6,080 5,925 6,080 5,925 Retail square feet at period end 344 340 344 340 Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $0.4 billion or 1.3% for the three months ended October 31, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the addition of net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in August 2018, and positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets. This increase was offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $1.0 billion and a reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018. Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $1.4 billion or 1.6% for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.1 billion and a reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018. This decrease was offset by the addition of net sales from Flipkart and positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets. Gross profit rate decreased 150 and 159 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases in gross profit rate for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , were primarily due to the addition of Flipkart, as well as a change in merchandise mix. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 49 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily due to a $0.3 billion non-cash impairment charge to write-off the carrying value of one of Flipkart's two fashion trade names, Jabong.com, as a result of a recent strategic decision to focus our efforts on a single fashion platform in order to simplify the business and customer proposition. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 5 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decrease for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and cost discipline across multiple markets, partially offset by the impairment charge described above. 27 Table of Contents As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $0.5 billion and $1.4 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended October 31, Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Including Fuel Net sales $ 14,625 $ 14,521 $ 43,504 $ 42,933 Percentage change from comparable period 0.7 % (2.3 )% 1.3 % (1.8 )% Calendar comparable sales increase 0.6 % 5.4 % 1.3 % 6.1 % Operating income $ 327 $ 379 $ 1,258 $ 1,106 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.2 % 2.6 % 2.9 % 2.6 % Unit counts at period end 599 597 599 597 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 13,075 $ 13,002 $ 38,979 $ 38,675 Percentage change from comparable period 0.6 % (4.3 )% 0.8 % (3.8 )% Operating income $ 274 $ 345 $ 1,141 $ 1,027 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.1 % 2.7 % 2.9 % 2.7 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $0.1 billion or 0.7% and $0.6 billion or 1.3% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 0.6% and 1.3% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and higher fuel sales, which were partially offset by lower ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.5% and 1.4% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively. Gross profit r ate decreased 30 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The gross profit rate decrease was due to investments in price and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs, partially offset by higher fuel margins and reduced tobacco sales, which have lower margins. Gross profit rate increased 8 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The gross profit rate increased from a reduction in the sale of tobacco, higher co-branded credit card income, and higher fuel margins, partially offset by increased eCommerce fulfillment costs and price investments. Membership and other incom e increased 1.9% and 5.0% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase for the three months ended October 31, 2019, was due to increases in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates, including those for Plus members. The increase for the nine months ended October 31, 2019, was primarily due to gains recognized on asset sales and other income along with the above mentioned increase in total members. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sal es increase d 11 basis points for t he three months ended October 31, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. This increase is primarily the result of a reduction in sales of tobacco and a higher level of technology investment partially offset by lower labor-related costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 14 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily the result of lower labor-related costs and a charge of approximately $50 million related to lease exist costs in the prior comparable period. These benefits were partially offset by a reduction in sales of tobacco. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $52 million for the three months ended October 31, 2019, and increased $152 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. 28 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,539 $ 17,308 We had net cash provided by operating activities of $14.5 billion and $17.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , and October 31, 2018 , respectively. The decline in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and U.S. associate payroll, as well as the inclusion of Flipkart operations . Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit Cash and cash equivalents were $8.6 billion and $9.2 billion at October 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Our working capital deficit was $15.9 billion at October 31, 2019 , which was relatively consistent with $16.3 billion at October 31, 2018 . We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S. While we are awaiting anticipated technical guidance from the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, we do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. As of October 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.4 billion at October 31, 2019 , approximately $0.8 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net cash used in investing activities $ (6,285 ) $ (20,554 ) Net cash used in investing activities was $6.3 billion and $20.6 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $14.3 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , primarily as a result of the prior year $13.1 billion payment for the acquisition of Flipkart, net of cash acquired, and the net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in Walmart Canada in fiscal 2020. 29 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in or Provided by Financing Activities Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (7,213 ) $ 5,921 Net cash provided by or used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $7.2 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , and net cash provided by financing activities was $5.9 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2018 . The change in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to the prior year $15.9 billion net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Flipkart and a net decrease in short-term borrowings as compared to the prior year, partially offset by $5.5 billion of additional long term debt issued in the current year to fund general business operations. Additionally, the Company has committed lines of credit in the U.S. with 22 financial institutions of $15.0 billion as of October 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , respectively, all undrawn. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 : (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2019 $ 1,876 $ 43,520 $ 45,396 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 5,492 5,492 Repayments of long-term debt (1,907 ) — (1,907 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 4,129 (4,129 ) — Other (5 ) 29 24 Balances as of October 31, 2019 $ 4,093 $ 44,912 $ 49,005 Our total outstanding long-term debt balance increased $3.6 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , primarily due to the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in both April 2019 and September 2019 to fund general business operations, partially offset by repayments of long-term debt. Dividends On February 19, 2019 , the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $ 2.12 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2019 annual dividend of $2.08 per share. For fiscal 2020 , the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.53 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 15, 2019 April 1, 2019 May 10, 2019 June 3, 2019 August 9, 2019 September 3, 2019 December 6, 2019 January 2, 2020 The dividend installments payable on April 1, 2019 , June 3, 2019 and September 3, 2019 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the nine months ended October 31, 2019 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of October 31, 2019 , authorization for $6.6 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. 30 Table of Contents We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 : Nine Months Ended October 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 Total number of shares repurchased $ 46 $ 45 Average price paid per share $ 103.98 $ 92.01 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 4,829 $ 4,161 Share repurchases increased $0.7 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal increases in merchandise inventories, our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. At October 31, 2019 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. 31 Table of Contents Other Matters In Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies"" and appears in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "" Item 1.

Legal Proceedings ,"" under the sub-caption ""I. Supplemental Information."" The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or the market value of our investments. Our market risks at October 31, 2019 are similar to those disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 . The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 , as filed with the SEC on March 28, 2019, under the caption ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 32 Table of Contents PART II.

The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 1,800 cases as of November 25, 2019; over 40 cases are in the process of being transferred to the MDL or have remand motions pending; and there are over 100 additional state cases pending as of November 25, 2019. The case citations for the state cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-Q. II. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In September 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified the Company that it had initiated an administrative penalty action by issuing a Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order. The letter accompanying the Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order alleges that the Company distributed and/or sold three unregistered pesticide products from March to June 2017. The EPA is seeking a penalty of $960,000. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for ensuring that a FIFRA-regulated product is properly registered prior to its sale. The Company is cooperating with the EPA. In January 2018, the Environmental Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuraduría Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of $163,000 for the absence of an Environmental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company is challenging the fine and denies any wrongdoing. In April 2017, the California Air Resources Board (""ARB"") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimed deposits collected on sales of small containers of automotive refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs. The ARB alleged that the Company had improperly retained approximately $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and has sought reimbursement. The Company has denied any wrongdoing. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. 33 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 , as supplemented by Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2019, which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the nine months ended October 31, 2019 , were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of October 31, 2019 , authorization for $6.6 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended October 31, 2019 , was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) August 1 - 31, 2019 4,433,894 $ 109.86 4,433,894 $ 7.2 September 1 - 30, 2019 2,480,316 116.90 2,480,316 6.9 October 1 - 31, 2019 2,791,452 118.63 2,791,452 6.6 Total 9,705,662 9,705,662 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019 ""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K . The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of July related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Restricted Cash Restricted cash held outside of cash and cash equivalents was $ 37 million and $ 34 million as of July 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , respectively, and was primarily recorded in prepaid expenses and other in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted cash not classified as part of cash and cash equivalents was $ 22 million and approximately $ 0.3 billion as of July 31, 2018 and January 31, 2018, respectively, and was primarily recorded in other long-term assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inventories At July 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet. The Company adopted this ASU and related amendments as of February 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach and elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to determine if they contain leases. For leases subject to index or rate adjustments, the most current index or rate adjustments were included in the measurement of operating lease obligations at adoption. The adoption of this ASU and related amendments resulted in a $ 14.8 billion increase to total assets and a $ 15.1 billion increase to total liabilities in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020""). In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $ 16.8 billion and $ 17.5 billion of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations, respectively, and removed $ 2.2 billion and $ 1.7 billion , respectively, of assets and liabilities related to financial obligations connected with the construction of leased stores. Several other asset and liability line items in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet were also impacted by immaterial amounts. Additionally, the adoption resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $ 0.3 billion , net of tax, which primarily consisted of the recognition of impairment. The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows were immaterially impacted. Updated accounting policies as a result of the adoption of this ASU are described below. Note 10 provides additional lease disclosures. For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company records right-of-use (""ROU"") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments. Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. 9 Table of Contents For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. Revenue Recognition Contract Balances Contract balances as a result of transactions with customers primarily consist of receivables included in receivables, net, and deferred gift card revenue included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table provides the Company's receivables and deferred gift card revenue from transactions with customers: (Amounts in millions) July 31, 2019 January 31, 2019 Assets: Receivables from transactions with customers, net $ 2,483 $ 2,538 Liabilities: Deferred gift card revenue $ 1,765 $ 1,932 Derivatives In fiscal 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities . The adoption of the standard had no current or historical impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company continues to use qualitative methods to assess the effectiveness of its designated hedging relationships. Upon adopting ASU 2017-12, the Company modified its existing hedge documentation to use a quantitative method for assessing effectiveness when the hedge is subsequently determined to be ineffective under the qualitative method. There were no other significant changes to the Company's accounting policies for derivatives. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 2. Net Income or Loss Per Common Share Basic net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 and 2018 . Further, the calculation of diluted net loss per common share attributable to Walmart for the three months ended July 31, 2018 does not include the effect of stock options and other share-based awards as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, and would reduce the net loss per common share.

Note 4. Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt The Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S., committed with 22 financial institutions, used to support its commercial paper program. In May 2019, the Company renewed and extended its existing five year credit facility of $ 5 billion and its 364-day revolving credit facility of $ 10 billion . In total, the Company has committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $ 15 billion at July 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , all undrawn. The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the six months ended July 31, 2019 : (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2019 $ 1,876 $ 43,520 $ 45,396 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 4,020 4,020 Repayments of long-term debt ( 407 ) — ( 407 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 2,932 ( 2,932 ) — Other ( 5 ) ( 204 ) ( 209 ) Balances as of July 31, 2019 $ 4,396 $ 44,404 $ 48,800 11 Table of Contents Debt Issuances Information on long-term debt issued during the six months ended July 31, 2019 : (Amounts in millions) Issue Date Principal Amount Maturity Date Fixed vs. Floating Interest Rate Net Proceeds April 23, 2019 1,500 USD July 8, 2024 Fixed 2.850 % $ 1,493 April 23, 2019 1,250 USD July 8, 2026 Fixed 3.050 % 1,242 April 23, 2019 1,250 USD July 8, 2029 Fixed 3.250 % 1,243 Various 42 USD Various Various Various 42 Total $ 4,020 These issuances, which are used for general corporate purposes, are senior, unsecured notes which rank equally with all other senior, unsecured debt obligations of the Company, and are not convertible or exchangeable. These issuances do not contain any financial covenants and do not restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase company stock. Maturities The following table provides details of debt repayments during the six months ended July 31, 2019 : (Amounts in millions) Maturity Date Original Amount Fixed vs. Floating Interest Rate Repayment February 1, 2019 500 USD Fixed 4.125 % $ 364 Various 43 USD Various Various 43 Total repayment of matured debt $ 407 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company has equity investments, primarily its investment in JD.com, Inc. (""JD""), measured at fair value on a recurring basis included in other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: • The purchased portion of the investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs, and • The portion of the investment in JD received in exchange for selling certain assets related to Yihaodian, the Company's former eCommerce operations in China, measured using Level 2 inputs. Fair value is determined primarily using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets. 12 Table of Contents Information for the fair value of the Company's investment in JD is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of July 31, 2019 Fair Value as of January 31, 2019 Investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs $ 2,155 $ 1,791 Investment in JD measured using Level 2 inputs 2,159 1,792 Total $ 4,314 $ 3,583 The changes in fair value for the Company's investment in JD is included in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also holds derivative instruments. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest yield and foreign currency forward curves. As of July 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: July 31, 2019 January 31, 2019 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 4,000 $ 30 $ 4,000 $ ( 78 ) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges 2,250 473 2,250 334 Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 4,004 ( 617 ) 4,173 ( 272 ) Total $ 10,254 $ ( 114 ) $ 10,423 $ ( 16 ) Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis are required as a result of a qualitative assessment of the Company's assets indicating a potential impairment or due to a business acquisition. Impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the six months ended July 31, 2019 were immaterial. As discussed in Note 8 , the Company met the criteria to recognize Walmart Brazil as held for sale in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Prior to meeting the held for sale criteria, the carrying values of the long-lived assets were concluded to be recoverable based upon cash flows expected to be generated over the assets' useful lives. When the sale of Walmart Brazil became probable, the Company reclassified the related assets and liabilities to held for sale and measured the disposal group at fair value, less costs to sell. The assets of the disposal group totaled $ 3.3 billion and were comprised of $ 1.0 billion in current assets, $ 1.6 billion in property and equipment and property under capital lease and financing obligations, net, and $ 0.7 billion of other long-term assets. These assets were fully impaired during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as the carrying value of the disposal group exceeded the fair value, less costs to sell. This impairment charge was included in the $ 4.8 billion loss recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as part of the Walmart International segment for the three and six months ended July 31, 2018. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of July 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , are as follows: July 31, 2019 January 31, 2019 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 48,800 $ 55,680 $ 45,396 $ 49,570 Note 6. Derivative Financial Instruments In connection with various derivative agreements, including master netting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $ 216 million and $ 220 million at July 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , respectively. Furthermore, as part of the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's net derivative liability position exceeds $ 150 million with such counterparties. The Company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at July 31, 2019 or January 31, 2019 . 13 Table of Contents At July 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , the Company had ¥ 180 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of £ 1.7 billion at July 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , that was designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to January 2039 . The Company's derivative instruments, as well as its nonderivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, were classified as follows in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: July 31, 2019 January 31, 2019 (Amounts in millions) Fair Value Instruments Net Investment Instruments Cash Flow Instruments Fair Value Instruments Net Investment Instruments Cash Flow Instruments Derivative instruments Derivative assets: Other long-term assets $ 33 $ 473 $ — $ — $ 334 $ 78 Derivative liabilities: Deferred income taxes and other 3 — 617 78 — 350 Nonderivative hedging instruments Long-term debt — 3,707 — — 3,863 — Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant. Note 7. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ASDA Equal Value Claims ASDA Stores Ltd. (""Asda""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over 30,000 equal value (""Equal Value"") claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the ""Employment Tribunal"") in the United Kingdom (""UK"") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. As a result, claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. In March 2015, Asda asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings and to ""strike out"" substantially all of the claims because the claimants had not adhered to the Tribunal's procedural rule for including multiple claimants on the same claim form. Ultimately, the Court of Appeals declined to strike out any claims relying on the Employment Tribunal’s finding that claimants had not deliberately disregarded the Tribunal’s procedural rule. As to the initial phase of the Equal Value claims, in October 2016 following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. In August 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal affirmed the Employment Tribunal's ruling and also granted permission for Asda to appeal substantially all of its findings. Asda sought permission to appeal the remainder of the Employment Appeal Tribunal's findings to the Court of Appeals and a hearing before the Court of Appeals on the comparability findings was held in October 2018. The Court of Appeals upheld the Employment Tribunal’s findings. The Supreme Court granted Asda's application to appeal the Court of Appeals decision on July 31, 2019. Claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. 14 Table of Contents At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. National Prescription Opiate Litigation and Related Matters In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. FCPA Investigation and Related Matters As previously disclosed, the Company was under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") regarding possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA""). Throughout the investigative process, the Company cooperated with the DOJ and the SEC, and on June 20, 2019, the Company announced the resolution of the investigations with the DOJ and the SEC and paid $ 283 million in June 2019 consisting of a combination of penalties, disgorgement and interest as further described below (the ""Settlement Amount""). The Company previously recorded the Settlement Amount in the Company's fiscal 2018 consolidated financial statements in anticipated settlement of these matters. The resolution of the investigations with the DOJ and SEC included: 1. A non-prosecution agreement (the ""NPA"") between the DOJ and the Company for a three-year term. Pursuant to the NPA, the Company paid a $ 138 million penalty and agreed to maintain the Company's anti-corruption compliance program for three years, certain reporting obligations for three years, and a limited monitorship with a third party for two years regarding the Company's anti-corruption compliance program, with the possibility of a third year pending the results of the monitorship during the initial two-year period. The DOJ agreed that it will not prosecute the Company for any conduct described in the NPA provided that the Company performs its obligations under the NPA for the three-year term. 2. A plea agreement (the ""Plea Agreement"") entered into for a three-year term by the DOJ and WMT Brasilia S.a.r.l., an indirect wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of the Company (""WMT Brasilia"") that previously owned a majority stake of the Company's Brazilian business. Through the Plea Agreement, entered in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, WMT Brasilia pled guilty to one count of causing a books and records violation of the FCPA. The Company on behalf of WMT Brasilia was assessed a $ 4 million penalty, including forfeiture, that was deducted from the amount paid by the Company under the NPA. 3. A Cease-and-Desist Order entered into by the SEC in a civil administrative proceeding (the ""SEC Order""), the entry of which the Company consented to with respect to certain violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. The Company paid $ 145 million in disgorgement and interest, and agreed to make certain reports to the SEC on its anti-corruption compliance and remediation efforts for two years, and cease and desist any violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. On June 20, 2019, the Company also entered into an Administrative Agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the ""EPA"") for a three-year term, which replaces the interim administrative agreement between the Company and the EPA dated May 28, 2013. The May 28, 2013 agreement arose as part of a settlement by the Company regarding certain hazardous waste materials matters with several governmental authorities. The new EPA agreement, among other things, resolved any debarment or suspension as to participation in federal government programs by the Company due to the NPA, the Plea Agreement, and the SEC Order, provided that the Company fulfills the terms and conditions of the new EPA agreement, which requires reporting by the Company to the EPA periodically during the three-year term, and requires a new, limited two-year monitorship. The monitor referenced above that has been engaged by the Company under the NPA will also monitor compliance with the new EPA agreement. If the DOJ monitorship is extended as referenced above, the EPA monitorship may also be extended for an additional year. 15 Table of Contents In addition, the Company expects to incur costs in implementing the settlement and may incur costs in responding to any new civil or regulatory actions. The Company does not presently believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Note 8. Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items The following disposals, acquisitions and related items pertain to the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or have been announced. Walmart Brazil In August 2018, the Company sold an 80 percent stake of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (""Advent""). Under the terms, Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax net loss of $ 4.8 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by $ 0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company indemnified Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$ 2.3 billion , adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. The Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. This equity method investment was determined to have no fair value and continues to have no carrying value. Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart"") In August 2018, the Company acquired 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace , for cash consideration of approximately $ 16 billion . The acquisition increased the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. The Company has finalized the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Flipkart acquisition as follows: • Assets of $ 24.1 billion , which comprise primarily of $ 2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $ 2.8 billion in other current assets, $ 5.0 billion in intangible assets and $ 13.5 billion in goodwill. Of the intangible assets, $ 4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The remaining $ 0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily relate to acquired technology with a life of 3 years. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale primarily related to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes; • Liabilities of $ 3.7 billion , which comprise primarily of $ 1.8 billion of current liabilities and $ 1.7 billion of deferred income taxes; and • Noncontrolling interest of $ 4.3 billion , for which the fair value was estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. Note 9. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil until the sale of the majority stake discussed in Note 8 . The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. 16 Table of Contents The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 85,200 $ 82,815 $ 165,544 $ 160,563 Walmart International 29,139 29,454 57,914 59,714 Sam's Club 15,049 14,790 28,879 28,412 Net sales $ 129,388 $ 127,059 $ 252,337 $ 248,689 Operating income by segment, as well as operating loss for corporate and support, interest, net and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 4,659 $ 4,479 $ 8,801 $ 8,406 Walmart International 893 1,269 1,631 2,534 Sam's Club 480 402 931 727 Corporate and support ( 449 ) ( 400 ) ( 835 ) ( 763 ) Operating income 5,583 5,750 10,528 10,904 Interest, net 585 503 1,210 990 Other (gains) and losses 85 4,849 ( 752 ) 6,694 Income before income taxes $ 4,913 $ 398 $ 10,070 $ 3,220 Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or market. In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales, where a customer initiates an order online and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020 "") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2019 , the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2019 incorporated by reference. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Beginning with the first quarter of the current fiscal year, we updated our definition of what was previously referred to as traffic (a component, along with ticket, of comparable sales). Traffic is now referred to as ""transactions"" and measures a percentage change in the number of sales transactions in our comparable stores, as well as for comparable eCommerce activity. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contribute to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates . We recently took some strategic actions to further position our portfolio for long-term growth, including: • Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart"") in August 2018. • Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (""Advent"") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019, substantially all of which was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. • Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile and Walmart Canada in December 2018 and April 2019, respectively. 20 Table of Contents The Retail Industry We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , were as follows: Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 With Fuel Fuel Impact With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 2.9 % 4.7 % 0.0 % 0.2 % 3.1 % 3.5 % 0.0 % 0.1 % Sam's Club 1.7 % 7.6 % 0.6 % 2.6 % 1.6 % 6.5 % 0.8 % 2.1 % Total U.S. 2.7 % 5.1 % 0.0 % 0.5 % 2.8 % 4.0 % 0.0 % 0.5 % Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 2.7% and 2.8% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 2.9% and 3.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, driven by growth in ticket and transactions . Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.4% to comparable sales for each of the three and six months ended July 31, 2019. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment were 1.7% and 1.6% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively. The Sam's Club segment's comparable sales benefited from increased transactions and higher fuel sales, which were partially offset by lower ticket. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.6% and 1.4% to comparable sales, respectively, for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 . The increase in comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment was partially offset by reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations. 21 Table of Contents Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net sales $ 129,388 $ 127,059 $ 252,337 $ 248,689 Percentage change from comparable period 1.8 % 4.2 % 1.5 % 4.3 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 26,871 $ 26,707 $ 52,817 $ 52,536 Percentage change from comparable period 0.6 % 3.3 % 0.5 % 4.1 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 20.8 % 21.0 % 20.9 % 21.1 % For the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 we leveraged operating expenses, decreasing operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 25 and 20 basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, respectively. The primary drivers of the expense leverage for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements in our Walmart U.S. segment. Our International and Sam's Club segments also leveraged expenses when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Strategic Capital Allocation We are allocating more capital to eCommerce, technology and supply chain as well as store remodels and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years. This allocation aligns with our initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and integrating digital and physical shopping and is consistent with the capital expenditure detail provided in the following table: (Amounts in millions) Six Months Ended July 31, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2019 2018 eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other $ 2,327 $ 1,972 Store remodels 1,310 1,117 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 41 182 Total U.S. 3,678 3,271 Walmart International 1,193 1,011 Total capital expenditures $ 4,871 $ 4,282 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.0% and 2.9% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income over the trailing twelve months, primarily resulting from lapping the $4.5 billion net loss in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and the restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. ROI was 14.3% and 13.8% for the trailing twelve months ended July 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The increase in ROI was due to the increase in operating income over the trailing twelve months primarily as a result of lapping the restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The denominator remained relatively flat as the $11.6 billion increase in average total assets due to the Flipkart Acquisition was offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from the removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (""ASU 2016-02"") since operating lease right of use assets are now included in total assets . 22 Table of Contents We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8 is no longer included in the calculation of ROI on a prospective basis as operating lease assets are now capitalized. For fiscal 2020, lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of the current balance sheet date, rather than averaged, because they are no longer directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8. A two-point average will be used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard. Further, beginning prospectively in fiscal 2020, rent expense in the numerator excludes short-term and variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the operating lease right-of-use asset balance. Prior to adoption of ASU 2016-02, we defined ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8, which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. Because the new lease standard was adopted under the modified retrospective approach as of February 1, 2019, our calculation of ROI for the comparable fiscal 2019 period was not revised. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. 23 Table of Contents The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 13,216 $ 5,816 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 220,462 $ 203,814 Return on assets (ROA) 6.0 % 2.9 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 21,581 $ 20,135 + Interest income 227 173 + Depreciation and amortization 10,782 10,692 + Rent 2,809 3,064 = Adjusted operating income $ 35,399 $ 34,064 Denominator Average total assets (1),(2) $ 227,557 $ 203,814 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1), (2) 86,003 82,413 - Average accounts payable (1) 44,500 42,759 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 21,769 21,266 + Rent x 8 N/A 24,512 = Average invested capital $ 247,291 $ 246,714 Return on investment (ROI) 14.3 % 13.8 % As of July 31, 2019 2018 2017 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 234,861 $ 206,062 $ 201,566 Leased assets, net 21,188 6,998 NP Total assets without leased assets, net 213,673 199,064 NP Accumulated depreciation and amortization 89,813 84,052 80,773 Accumulated amortization on leased assets 3,686 5,547 NP Accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets 86,127 78,505 NP Accounts payable 45,871 43,128 42,389 Accrued liabilities 20,691 22,846 19,686 (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2.

Average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets plus accumulated amortization on leased assets as of July 31, 2019. NP = Not provided. 24 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $11.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 , which was relatively flat when compared to $11.1 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2018 . We generated free cash flow of $6.3 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 , which declined when compared to $6.8 billion for the three months ended July 31, 2018 primarily due to $0.6 billion in increased capital expenditures. Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,185 $ 11,095 Payments for property and equipment (4,871 ) (4,282 ) Free cash flow $ 6,314 $ 6,813 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (3,824 ) $ (4,428 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (5,531 ) 2,480 (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Total revenues $ 130,377 $ 128,028 $ 254,302 $ 250,718 Percentage change from comparable period 1.8 % 3.8 % 1.4 % 4.1 % Net sales $ 129,388 $ 127,059 $ 252,337 $ 248,689 Percentage change from comparable period 1.8 % 4.2 % 1.5 % 4.3 % Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 2.7 % 5.1 % 2.8 % 4.0 % Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 24.3 % 24.8 % 24.3 % 24.7 % Operating income $ 5,583 $ 5,750 $ 10,528 $ 10,904 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.3 % 4.5 % 4.2 % 4.4 % Other (gains) and losses $ 85 $ 4,849 $ (752 ) $ 6,694 Consolidated net income (loss) $ 3,680 $ (727 ) $ 7,586 $ 1,549 Unit counts at period end 11,389 11,735 11,389 11,735 Retail square feet at period end 1,127 1,155 1,127 1,155 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $2.3 billion or 1.8% and $3.6 billion or 1.4% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenues were due to increases in net sales, which were primarily due to overall positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments and the addition of Flipkart's net sales, which we acquired in August 2018. These increases were partially offset by our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018 and a $1.3 billion and $3.2 billion negative impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively. Our gross profit as a percentage of net sales (""gross profit rate"") decreased 23 and 31 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. These decreases were primarily due to the addition of Flipkart and price investment in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments, partially offset by favorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 25 and 20 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements in our Walmart U.S. segment. Our International and Sam's Club segments also leveraged expenses when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Other gains and losses consisted of a loss of $85 million and $4.8 billion for the three months ended July 31, 2019 and July 31, 2018, respectively, consisted of a gain of $752 million and a loss of $6.7 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 and July 31, 2018, respectively. The changes in other gains and losses when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year were primarily due to the inclusion of a $4.8 billion pre-tax loss recorded related to the sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil and the recognition of changes in fair value of our investment in JD.com. Our effective income tax rate was 25.1% and 24.7% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, compared to 283% and 52% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to the loss related to the sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil which increased the effective tax rate 227% and 28% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2018, respectively, as it provided minimal realizable tax benefit. Additionally, for the three months ended July 31, 2018, the adjustment in the provisional amount recorded related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 increased the effective tax rate by 31%. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be higher than the U.S. statutory rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $4.4 billion and $6.0 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $1.26 and $2.59 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, which represents an increase of $1.55 and $2.16 when compared to the same periods, respectively, in the previous fiscal year. 26 Table of Contents Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net sales $ 85,200 $ 82,815 $ 165,544 $ 160,563 Percentage change from comparable period 2.9 % 5.2 % 3.1 % 4.1 % Calendar comparable sales increase 2.9 % 4.7 % 3.1 % 3.5 % Operating income $ 4,659 $ 4,479 $ 8,801 $ 8,406 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.5 % 5.4 % 5.3 % 5.2 % Unit counts at period end 4,759 4,761 4,759 4,761 Retail square feet at period end 704 705 704 705 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $2.4 billion or 2.9% and $5.0 billion or 3.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to comparable sales of 2.9% and 3.1% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, driven by growth in ticket and transactions . Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.4% to comparable sales during the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 and were primarily driven by online grocery and Walmart.com. Gross profit rate decreased 22 and 9 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases were primarily the result of continued price investments, seasonal markdowns related to cooler weather during the second quarter and the growing mix of eCommerce. These decreases were partially offset by better merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 29 and 19 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales and productivity improvements, partially offset by the continued growth of eCommerce in the segment. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net sales $ 29,139 $ 29,454 $ 57,914 $ 59,714 Percentage change from comparable period (1.1 )% 4.0 % (3.0 )% 7.7 % Operating income $ 893 $ 1,269 $ 1,631 $ 2,534 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.1 % 4.3 % 2.8 % 4.2 % Unit counts at period end 6,031 6,377 6,031 6,377 Retail square feet at period end 343 370 343 370 Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $0.3 billion or 1.1% and $1.8 billion or 3.0% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. These decreases were driven by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $1.3 billion and $3.1 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively. These decreases were also driven by a reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018, partially offset by the addition of net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in August 2018, and positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets. Gross profit rate decreased 157 and 164 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases in gross profit rate for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , were primarily due to the addition of Flipkart, as well as a change in merchandise mix and strategic price investments in certain markets. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 36 and 32 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively. The decreases for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , were primarily due to positive comp sales in the majority of our markets and cost discipline across multiple markets. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $0.4 billion and $0.9 billion for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. 27 Table of Contents Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Including Fuel Net sales $ 15,049 $ 14,790 $ 28,879 $ 28,412 Percentage change from comparable period 1.8 % (0.6 )% 1.6 % (1.6 )% Calendar comparable sales increase 1.7 % 7.6 % 1.6 % 6.5 % Operating income $ 480 $ 402 $ 931 $ 727 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.2 % 2.7 % 3.2 % 2.6 % Unit counts at period end 599 597 599 597 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 13,451 $ 13,293 $ 25,904 $ 25,673 Percentage change from comparable period 1.2 % (3.1 )% 0.9 % (3.6 )% Operating income $ 424 $ 369 $ 867 $ 682 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.2 % 2.8 % 3.3 % 2.7 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $0.3 billion or 1.8% and $0.5 billion or 1.6% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 1.7% and 1.6% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.6% and 1.4% to comparable sales for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations. Gross profit r ate increased 11 and 28 basis points for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. For the three months ended July 31, 2019 , the gross profit rate increased from a reduction in the sale of tobacco, which has lower margins, higher co-branded credit card income, and higher margins on fuel. These benefits were partially offset by price investments. For the six months ended July 31, 2019 , the gross profit rate increased from a reduction in the sale of tobacco and higher co-branded credit card income, partially offset by increased eCommerce fulfillment and shipping costs and price investments. Membership and other incom e increased 8.4% and 6.6% for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to gains recognized on asset sales and increases in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates, including those for Plus members. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sal es decreased 21 and 27 basis points for t he three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. These decreases were primarily the result of lower labor-related costs, partially offset by a reduction in the sale of tobacco. Additionally, for the six months ended July 31, 2019 , operating expense as a percentage of net sales benefited by a charge of approximately $50 million related to lease exit costs in the prior comparable period. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $78 million and $204 million for the three and six months ended July 31, 2019 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. 28 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,185 $ 11,095 We had net cash provided by operating activities of $11.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 , which was relatively flat when compared to $11.1 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2018 . Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Cash and cash equivalents were $9.3 billion and $15.8 billion at July 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Our working capital deficit was $18.9 billion and $5.3 billion at July 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. The working capital reductions at July 31, 2019 compared to July 31, 2018 were primarily due to the cash increase in the prior fiscal year that resulted from the debt issuance to fund a portion of the Flipkart purchase price as well as other general corporate purposes (the ""Fiscal 2019 Debt Offering""). The reduction was supplemented by an increase in long-term debt due within one year. These working capital reductions were partially offset by a higher inventory level in the Walmart U.S. segment. We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S. We are awaiting anticipated technical guidance from the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. We do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. As of July 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion and $2.8 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.5 billion at July 31, 2019 , approximately $1.1 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net cash used in investing activities $ (3,824 ) $ (4,428 ) Net cash used in investing activities was $3.8 billion and $4.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $0.6 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 , primarily as a result of net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in Walmart Canada. 29 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in or Provided by Financing Activities Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (5,531 ) $ 2,480 Net cash used in or provided by financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $5.5 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 , and net cash provided by financing activities was $2.5 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2018 . The change in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to a reduction in proceeds received from issuance of long-term as compared to the prior year which included the Fiscal 2019 Debt Offering. This was partially offset by a reduction in payments of short-term borrowings as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the Company has committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion as of July 31, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , respectively, all undrawn. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the six months ended July 31, 2019 : (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2019 $ 1,876 $ 43,520 $ 45,396 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 4,020 4,020 Repayments of long-term debt (407 ) — (407 ) Reclassifications of long-term debt 2,932 (2,932 ) — Other (5 ) (204 ) (209 ) Balances as of July 31, 2019 $ 4,396 $ 44,404 $ 48,800 Our total outstanding long-term debt balance increased $3.4 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 , primarily due to the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in April 2019 to fund general business operations. Dividends On February 19, 2019 , the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $ 2.12 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2019 annual dividend of $2.08 per share. For fiscal 2020 , the annual dividend were or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.53 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 15, 2019 April 1, 2019 May 10, 2019 June 3, 2019 August 9, 2019 September 3, 2019 December 6, 2019 January 2, 2020 The dividend installments payable on April 1, 2019 , June 3, 2019 and September 3, 2019 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three and six months ended July 31, 2019, were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of July 31, 2019 , authorization for $7.7 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. 30 Table of Contents We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for the six months ended July 31, 2019 and 2018 : Six Months Ended July 31, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 Total number of shares repurchased 36.6 20.8 Average price paid per share $ 101.26 $ 88.81 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 3,707 $ 1,844 Share repurchases increased $1.9 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, due to the prior fiscal year suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the announcement to acquire Flipkart. Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories, our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. At July 31, 2019 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. 31 Table of Contents Other Matters In Note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned ""Contingencies"" and appears in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "" Item 1.

The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or the market value of our investments. Our market risks at July 31, 2019 are similar to those disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 . The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 , as filed with the SEC on March 28, 2019, under the caption ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 32 Table of Contents PART II.

National Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the ""MDL""). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 1,500 cases as of August 29, 2019; over 30 cases are in the process of being transferred to the MDL or have remand motions pending; and there are over 100 additional state cases pending as of August 29, 2019. The case citations for the state cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-Q. II. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In September 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified the Company that it had initiated an administrative penalty action by issuing a Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order. The letter accompanying the Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order alleges that the Company distributed and/or sold three unregistered pesticide products from March to June 2017. The EPA is seeking a penalty of $960,000. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for ensuring that a FIFRA-regulated product is properly registered prior to its sale. The Company is cooperating with the EPA. In January 2018, the Environmental Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuraduría Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of $163,000 for the absence of an Environmental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company is challenging the fine and denies any wrongdoing. In April 2017, the California Air Resources Board (""ARB"") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimed deposits collected on sales of small containers of automotive refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs. The ARB alleged that the Company had improperly retained approximately $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and has sought reimbursement. The Company has denied any wrongdoing. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. 33 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 , which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The Company is supplementing those risk factors by updating the risk factor below. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Natural disasters, changes in climate, geo-political events and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate, geo-political events and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (two of which recently occurred in our stores), in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located, could have a negative impact on consumer spending and could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in our communications with our stores. We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the six months ended July 31, 2019 , were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of July 31, 2019 , authorization for $7.7 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries (""Walmart"" or the ""Company"") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019 ""). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K . The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States (""U.S."") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of April related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31. Restricted Cash Restricted cash held outside of cash and cash equivalents was $37 million and $34 million as of April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , respectively, and was primarily recorded in prepaid expenses and other in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted cash held outside of cash and cash equivalents was $300 million as of April 30, 2018 and January 31, 2018, respectively, and was primarily recorded in other long-term assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Inventories At April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet. The Company adopted this ASU and related amendments as of February 1, 2019 under the modified retrospective approach and elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to determine if they contain leases. For leases subject to index or rate adjustments, the most current index or rate adjustments were included in the measurement of operating lease obligations at adoption. The adoption of this ASU and related amendments resulted in a $14.8 billion increase to total assets and a $15.1 billion increase to total liabilities as of April 30, 2019. The Company recognized $16.8 billion and $17.5 billion of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations, respectively, and removed $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion , respectively, of assets and liabilities related to financial obligations connected with the construction of leased stores. Several other asset and liability line items in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet were also impacted by immaterial amounts. Additionally, the adoption resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $0.3 billion , net of tax, which primarily consisted of the recognition of impairment. The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows were immaterially impacted. Updated accounting policies as a result of the adoption of this ASU are described below. Note 10 provides additional lease disclosures. For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease. The Company records right-of-use (""ROU"") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term of the lease. As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the Company’s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments. Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. 8 Table of Contents For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance. Revenue Recognition Contract Balances Contract balances as a result of transactions with customers primarily consist of receivables included in receivables, net, and deferred gift card revenue included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table provides the Company's receivables and deferred gift card revenue from transactions with customers: (Amounts in millions) April 30, 2019 January 31, 2019 Assets: Receivables from transactions with customers, net $ 2,566 $ 2,538 Liabilities: Deferred gift card revenue $ 1,899 $ 1,932 Derivatives In fiscal 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities . The adoption of the standard had no current or historical impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company continues to use qualitative methods to assess the effectiveness of its designated hedging relationships. Upon adopting ASU 2017-12, the Company modified its existing hedge documentation to use a quantitative method for assessing effectiveness when the hedge is subsequently determined to be ineffective under the qualitative method. There were no other significant changes to the Company's accounting policies for derivatives. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 . The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 Numerator Consolidated net income $ 3,906 $ 2,276 Consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (64 ) (142 ) Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart $ 3,842 $ 2,134 Denominator Weighted-average common shares outstanding, basic 2,869 2,950 Dilutive impact of share-based awards 17 17 Weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted 2,886 2,967 Net income per common share attributable to Walmart Basic $ 1.34 $ 0.72 Diluted 1.33 0.72 9 Table of Contents Note 3.

Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation resulting from the disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Note 4. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in the Company's long-term debt for the three months ended April 30, 2019 : (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2019 $ 1,876 $ 43,520 $ 45,396 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 3,978 3,978 Repayments of long-term debt (364 ) — (364 ) Other (48 ) (73 ) (121 ) Balances as of April 30, 2019 $ 1,464 $ 47,425 $ 48,889 10 Table of Contents Debt Issuances Information on long-term debt issued during the three months ended April 30, 2019 for general corporate purposes is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Issue Date Principal Amount Maturity Date Fixed vs. Floating Interest Rate Net Proceeds April 23, 2019 1,500 USD July 8, 2024 Fixed 2.850% $ 1,493 April 23, 2019 1,250 USD July 8, 2026 Fixed 3.050% 1,242 April 23, 2019 1,250 USD July 8, 2029 Fixed 3.250% 1,243 Total $ 3,978 These issuances are senior, unsecured notes which rank equally with all other senior, unsecured debt obligations of the Company, and are not convertible or exchangeable. These issuances do not contain any financial covenants and do not restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase company stock. Maturities The following table provides details of debt repayments during the three months ended April 30, 2019 : (Amounts in millions) Maturity Date Original Amount Fixed vs. Floating Interest Rate Repayment February 1, 2019 500 USD Fixed 4.125% $ 364 Total repayment of matured debt $ 364 Note 5. Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions. The Company has equity investments, primarily its investment in JD.com, Inc. (""JD""), measured at fair value on a recurring basis included in other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: • The purchased portion of the investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs, and • The portion of the investment in JD received in exchange for selling certain assets related to Yihaodian, the Company's former eCommerce operations in China, measured using Level 2 inputs. Fair value is determined primarily using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets. Information for the fair value of the Company's investment in JD is as follows: (Amounts in millions) Fair Value as of April 30, 2019 Fair Value as of January 31, 2019 Investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs $ 2,181 $ 1,791 Investment in JD measured using Level 2 inputs 2,185 1,792 Total $ 4,366 $ 3,583 The changes in fair value for the Company's investment in JD is included in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 11 Table of Contents The Company also holds derivative instruments. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest yield and foreign currency forward curves. As of April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows: April 30, 2019 January 31, 2019 (Amounts in millions) Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair Value Receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 4,000 $ (42 ) $ 4,000 $ (78 ) Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges 2,250 392 2,250 334 Receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges 4,090 (408 ) 4,173 (272 ) Total $ 10,340 $ (58 ) $ 10,423 $ (16 ) Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis are required as a result of impairment charges or business acquisitions. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements as of April 30, 2019 or January 31, 2019 , respectively. Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities. The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , are as follows: April 30, 2019 January 31, 2019 (Amounts in millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year $ 48,889 $ 53,707 $ 45,396 $ 49,570 Note 6. Derivative Financial Instruments In connection with various derivative agreements, including master netting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $209 million and $220 million at April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , respectively. Furthermore, as part of the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the Company's net derivative liability position exceeds $150 million with such counterparties. The Company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties at April 30, 2019 or January 31, 2019 , respectively. At April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , the Company had ¥180 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of £1.7 billion at April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , that was designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to January 2039 . The Company's derivative instruments, as well as its nonderivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, were classified as follows in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets: April 30, 2019 January 31, 2019 (Amounts in millions) Fair Value Instruments Net Investment Instruments Cash Flow Instruments Fair Value Instruments Net Investment Instruments Cash Flow Instruments Derivative instruments Derivative assets: Other long-term assets $ — $ 392 $ 41 $ — $ 334 $ 78 Derivative liabilities: Deferred income taxes and other 42 — 449 78 — 350 Nonderivative hedging instruments Long-term debt — 3,794 — — 3,863 — Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant. 12 Table of Contents Note 7. Contingencies Legal Proceedings The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. ASDA Equal Value Claims ASDA Stores Ltd. (""Asda""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in over 30,000 equal value (""Equal Value"") claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the ""Employment Tribunal"") in the United Kingdom (""UK"") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. As a result, claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. In March 2015, Asda asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings and to ""strike out"" substantially all of the claims because the claimants had not adhered to the Tribunal's procedural rule for including multiple claimants on the same claim form. In July 2015, the Employment Tribunal denied Asda's requests. Following additional proceedings, in June 2017 the Employment Appeal Tribunal ruled in favor of Asda on the ""strike out"" issue and remitted the matter to the Employment Tribunal to determine whether the improperly filed claims should be struck out. In October 2018, claimants appealed this ruling to the Court of Appeals and in January 2019, the Court of Appeals declined to strike out any claims relying on the Employment Tribunal’s finding that claimants had not deliberately disregarded the Tribunal’s procedural rule. As to the initial phase of the Equal Value claims, in October 2016 following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. In August 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal affirmed the Employment Tribunal's ruling and also granted permission for Asda to appeal substantially all of its findings. Asda sought permission to appeal the remainder of the Employment Appeal Tribunal's findings to the Court of Appeals and a hearing before the Court of Appeals on the comparability findings was held in October 2018. The Court of Appeals upheld the Employment Tribunal’s findings. Asda sought permission to appeal the Court of Appeals decision to the Supreme Court on February 27, 2019 and is awaiting a decision on its application. Claimants are now proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. The Company believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. National Prescription Opiate Litigation and Related Matters In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. 13 Table of Contents FCPA Investigation and Related Matters The Audit Committee (the ""Audit Committee"") of the Board of Directors of the Company has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. (""Walmex""), and whether prior allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. The Audit Committee and the Company engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and other advisors who assisted in the investigation of these matters. The Company also conducted a voluntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance and, as part of that review, strengthened and enhanced its global anti-corruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures. In November 2011, the Company voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). Since the implementation of the global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit Committee and the Company identified or were made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. When such allegations were reported or identified, the Audit Committee and the Company, together with their third-party advisors, conducted inquiries and investigations. Inquiries or investigations regarding allegations of potential FCPA violations were conducted in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates or has operated, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India. As previously disclosed, the Company is under investigation by the DOJ and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. The Company has been cooperating with the agencies and discussions have been ongoing regarding the resolution of these matters. These discussions progressed to a point that, in fiscal 2018, the Company reasonably estimated a probable loss and recorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to these matters (the ""Accrual""). While the Company believes the final resolution of these matters is nearing a conclusion, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters. A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico also investigated these matters. Walmex cooperated with the Mexican governmental agencies that conducted these investigations. Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation were filed by several of the Company's shareholders against Walmart, certain current and former directors and former officers and certain of Walmex's former officers. These matters have been resolved. Existing lawsuits relating to the allegations have been resolved, but the Company could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. There could be one or more enforcement actions or lawsuits in respect of the matters that are the subject of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties. The Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles on these matters, which could impact the perception among certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen. In addition, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with the government investigations and in conducting the investigations. These costs will be expensed as incurred. For the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 , the Company incurred the following third-party expenses in connection with the FCPA investigation and related matters: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Ongoing inquiries and investigations $ 2 $ 4 Global compliance program and organizational enhancements 2 3 Total $ 4 $ 7 The Company does not presently believe that these matters, including the payment of the Accrual at some point-in-time in the future, will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows , although given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, the Company can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future. 14 Table of Contents Note 8. Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items The following disposals, acquisitions and related items pertain to the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or have been announced. Walmart Brazil In August 2018, the Company sold an 80 percent stake of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (""Advent""). Under the terms, Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters. Additionally, the Company may receive up to approximately $250 million in contingent consideration. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by $0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company indemnified Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion , adjusted for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. The Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. This equity method investment was determined to have no fair value and continues to have no carrying value. Flipkart In August 2018, the Company acquired 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace , for cash consideration of approximately $16 billion . The acquisition increases the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. The purchase price allocation, which is still preliminary primarily due to certain tax items, is as follows: • Assets of $24.1 billion , which comprise primarily of $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 billion in other current assets, $5.0 billion in intangible assets and $13.5 billion in goodwill. Of the intangible assets, $4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. The remaining $0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily relate to acquired technology with a life of 3 years. The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated synergies and economies of scale primarily related to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes; • Liabilities of $3.7 billion , which comprise primarily of $1.8 billion of current liabilities and $1.8 billion of deferred income taxes; and • Noncontrolling interest of $4.3 billion , for which the fair value was estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. Asda In April 2019, the Company announced the termination of a previously announced merger agreement that would have provided for the combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited, the Company's U.K. subsidiary. As the proposed transaction had not yet met the held for sale criteria, the announcement of its termination had no impact on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 15 Table of Contents Note 9. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue Segments The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil until the sale of the majority stake discussed in Note 8 . The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services. The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments. The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. Net sales by segment are as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net sales: Walmart U.S. $ 80,344 $ 77,748 Walmart International 28,775 30,260 Sam's Club 13,830 13,622 Net sales $ 122,949 $ 121,630 Operating income by segment, as well as operating loss for corporate and support, interest, net and other gains and losses are as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Operating income (loss): Walmart U.S. $ 4,142 $ 3,927 Walmart International 738 1,265 Sam's Club 451 325 Corporate and support (386 ) (363 ) Operating income 4,945 5,154 Interest, net 625 487 Other (gains) and losses (837 ) 1,845 Income before income taxes $ 5,157 $ 2,822 16 Table of Contents Disaggregated Revenues In the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or market.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s (""Walmart,"" the ""Company,"" ""our,"" or ""we"") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020 (""fiscal 2020 "") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 (""fiscal 2019""), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 , and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2019 , the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2019 incorporated by reference. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole. Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, we updated our definition of what was previously referred to as traffic (a component, along with ticket, of comparable sales). Traffic will now be referred to ""transactions"" and measures a percentage change in all sales transactions in our comparable stores, as well as for comparable eCommerce activity. In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future. Each of our segments contribute to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates . We recently took some strategic actions to further position our portfolio for long-term growth, including: • Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited (""Flipkart"") in August 2018. • Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (""Advent"") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019, substantially all of which was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. • Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile and Walmart Canada in December 2018 and April 2019, respectively. 19 Table of Contents In April 2019, we announced the termination of the previously announced merger agreement that would have provided for the combination of J Sainsbury plc and ASDA Group Limited, our U.K. subsidiary. The Retail Industry We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (""associates""). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Company Performance Metrics We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as: • strong, efficient growth; • consistent operating discipline; and • strategic capital allocation. As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time. Strong, Efficient Growth Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 , were as follows: Three Months Ended April 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 With Fuel Fuel Impact Walmart U.S. 3.3 % 2.4 % 0.0 % 0.1 % Sam's Club 1.4 % 5.3 % 0.9 % 1.4 % Total U.S. 3.0 % 2.8 % 0.1 % 0.3 % The Walmart U.S. segment had growth of 3.3% and 2.4% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, driven by growth in ticket and transactions . For the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 , the Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.4% and 1.0% to comparable sales, respectively. Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment were 1.4% and 5.3% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Sam's Club segment's comparable sales benefited from increased transactions and higher fuel sales, which were partially offset by lower ticket. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.1% and 0.8% to comparable sales, respectively, for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 . The increase in comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment was partially offset by reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations. 20 Table of Contents Consistent Operating Discipline We operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (""operating"") expenses. Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net sales $ 122,949 $ 121,630 Percentage change from comparable period 1.1 % 4.4 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 25,946 $ 25,829 Percentage change from comparable period 0.5 % 4.9 % Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 21.1 % 21.2 % For the three months ended April 30, 2019 we leveraged operating expenses, decreasing operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 14 basis points when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage for the three months ended April 30, 2019 were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements in our Walmart U.S. segment. Our International and Sam's Club segments also leveraged expenses when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Strategic Capital Allocation We are allocating more capital to store remodels, eCommerce, technology and supply chain and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years. This allocation aligns with our initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and integrating digital and physical shopping and is consistent with the capital expenditure detail provided in the following table: (Amounts in millions) Three Months Ended April 30, Allocation of Capital Expenditures 2019 2018 eCommerce, technology, supply chain and other $ 1,003 $ 805 Remodels 595 475 New stores and clubs, including expansions and relocations 23 103 Total U.S. 1,621 1,383 Walmart International 584 435 Total capital expenditures $ 2,205 $ 1,818 Returns As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Return on Assets and Return on Investment We include Return on Assets (""ROA""), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), and Return on Investment (""ROI"") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 4.0% and 4.8% for the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The decline in ROA was primarily due to the decrease in consolidated net income over the trailing twelve months, primarily resulting from the $4.5 billion net loss in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and net unrealized losses on our JD.com investment. ROI was 14.5% and 13.9% for the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The increase in ROI was due to the increase in operating income over the trailing twelve months primarily as a result of lapping the restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The denominator remained relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the Flipkart Acquisition was primarily offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from the removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (""ASU 2016-02"") as operating lease right-of-use assets are now included in total assets. 21 Table of Contents We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8 is no longer included in the calculation of ROI on a prospective basis as operating lease assets are now capitalized. For fiscal 2020, lease related assets and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount as of the current balance sheet date, rather than averaged, because they are no longer directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8. A two-point average will be used for leased assets beginning in fiscal 2021, after one full year from the date of adoption of the new lease standard. Further, beginning prospectively in fiscal 2020, rent expense in the numerator excludes short-term and variable lease costs as these costs are not included in the operating lease right-of-use asset balance. Prior to adoption of ASU 2016-02, we defined ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We considered average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8, which estimated the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. Because the new lease standard was adopted under the modified retrospective approach as of February 1, 2019, our calculation of ROI for the comparable fiscal 2019 period was not revised. Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI. 22 Table of Contents The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows: For the Trailing Twelve Months Ending April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 CALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS Numerator Consolidated net income $ 8,809 $ 9,647 Denominator Average total assets (1) $ 219,736 $ 202,323 Return on assets (ROA) 4.0 % 4.8 % CALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT Numerator Operating income $ 21,748 $ 20,354 + Interest income 222 160 + Depreciation and amortization 10,714 10,656 + Rent 2,866 3,036 = Adjusted operating income $ 35,550 $ 34,206 Denominator Average total assets (1),(2) $ 226,465 $ 202,323 + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) ,(2) 84,960 81,862 - Average accounts payable (1) 44,861 42,990 - Average accrued liabilities (1) 20,903 20,245 + Rent x 8 N/A 24,288 = Average invested capital $ 245,661 $ 245,238 Return on investment (ROI) 14.5 % 13.9 % As of April 30, 2019 2018 2017 Certain Balance Sheet Data Total assets $ 234,544 $ 204,927 $ 199,718 Leased assets, net 20,637 7,178 NP Total assets without leased assets, net 213,907 197,749 NP Accumulated depreciation and amortization 87,426 84,964 78,760 Accumulated amortization on leased assets 3,085 5,556 NP Accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets 84,341 79,408 NP Accounts payable 45,110 44,612 41,367 Accrued liabilities 21,023 20,782 19,708 (1) The average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2 . Average total assets as used in ROA includes the average impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02. (2) For the twelve months ended April 30, 2019, as a result of adopting ASU 2016-02, average total assets is based on the average of total assets without leased assets, net plus leased assets, net as of April 30, 2019. Average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization, without leased assets plus accumulated amortization on leased assets as of April 30, 2019. NP = Not provided. 23 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $3.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , which declined when compared to $5.2 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2018 primarily due to an increase in inventory related to accelerated buying in certain categories, the timing of sell through for summer seasonal merchandise and increased eCommerce fulfillment center mirroring, as well as the timing of payments. We generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , which declined when compared to $3.3 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in increased capital expenditures . Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities. Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,563 $ 5,161 Payments for property and equipment (2,205 ) (1,818 ) Free cash flow $ 1,358 $ 3,343 Net cash used in investing activities (1) $ (1,135 ) $ (1,682 ) Net cash used in financing activities (846 ) (2,486 ) (1) ""Net cash used in investing activities"" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 Total revenues $ 123,925 $ 122,690 Percentage change from comparable period 1.0 % 4.4 % Net sales $ 122,949 $ 121,630 Percentage change from comparable period 1.1 % 4.4 % Total U.S. calendar comparable sales increase 3.0 % 2.8 % Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 24.3 % 24.6 % Operating income $ 4,945 $ 5,154 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 4.0 % 4.2 % Other (gains) and losses $ (837 ) $ 1,845 Consolidated net income $ 3,906 $ 2,276 Unit counts at period end 11,368 11,717 Retail square feet at period end 1,128 1,157 Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $1.2 billion or 1.0% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in revenues was due to an increase in net sales, which was primarily due to overall positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, the addition of Flipkart's net sales, and positive comparable sales in the majority of our International markets. These increases were partially offset by a $1.8 billion negative impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil . Our gross profit rate decreased 27 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to the addition of Flipkart and price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment, partially offset by favorable merchandise mix and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 14 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements in our Walmart U.S. segment. Our International and Sam's Club segments also leveraged expenses when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Other (gains) and losses increased $2.7 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 due to fair value changes of our investment in JD.com. Our effective income tax rate was 24.3% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , compared to 19.3% for the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended April 30, 2019 was primarily due to a favorable, provisional amount recognized related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 during the three months ended April 30, 2018 . Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be higher than the U.S. statutory rate. As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $1.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $1.33 for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , which represents an increase of $0.61 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. 25 Table of Contents Walmart U.S. Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 Net sales $ 80,344 $ 77,748 Percentage change from comparable period 3.3 % 3.1 % Calendar comparable sales increase 3.3 % 2.4 % Operating income $ 4,142 $ 3,927 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 5.2 % 5.1 % Unit counts at period end 4,763 4,761 Retail square feet at period end 704 705 Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $2.6 billion or 3.3% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase in net sales was due to comparable sales of 3.3% driven by growth in ticket and transactions . Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.4% to comparable sales during the three months ended April 30, 2019 and were driven by online grocery and ship-to-home. Gross profit rate increased 6 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The improvement was due to favorable merchandise mix and less pressure from transportation costs, partially offset by price investments. The merchandise mix improvement was the result of strong private brands penetration and eCommerce performance in the home and apparel categories. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales and productivity improvements, partially offset by continued investments in eCommerce. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $215 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Walmart International Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 Net sales $ 28,775 $ 30,260 Percentage change from comparable period (4.9 )% 11.7 % Operating income $ 738 $ 1,265 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 2.6 % 4.2 % Unit counts at period end 6,006 6,359 Retail square feet at period end 344 372 Net sales for the Walmart International segment decreased $1.5 billion or 4.9% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. This decrease was due to $1.8 billion of negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates and a reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil , partially offset by the addition of Flipkart's net sales and positive comparable sales growth in the majority of our markets. Gross profit r ate decreased 172 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to the addition of Flipkart, as well as a change in merchandise mix in certain other markets. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily due to the prior year charge related to the divestiture of our Canada banking operations of approximately $81 million and the prior year wind down of the first party Brazil eCommerce operations. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income decreased $527 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. 26 Table of Contents Sam's Club Segment Three Months Ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2019 2018 Including Fuel Net sales $ 13,830 $ 13,622 Percentage change from comparable period 1.5 % (2.7 )% Calendar comparable sales increase 1.4 % 5.3 % Operating income $ 451 $ 325 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.3 % 2.4 % Unit counts at period end 599 597 Retail square feet at period end 80 80 Excluding Fuel (1) Net sales $ 12,453 $ 12,380 Percentage change from comparable period 0.6 % (4.1 )% Operating income $ 443 $ 313 Operating income as a percentage of net sales 3.6 % 2.5 % (1) We believe the ""Excluding Fuel"" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $0.2 billion or 1.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was due to comparable sales of 1.4%. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.1% to comparable sales. In addition, higher fuel sales of $135 million also contributed to the comparable sales growth. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations. Gross profit r ate increased 47 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The gross profit rate benefited from decreased tobacco sales, which have lower margins, and lapping inventory exit costs associated with closed clubs. These benefits were partially offset by increased eCommerce fulfillment and shipping costs. Membership and other incom e in creased 4.7% for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to gains recognized on asset sales and increased Plus Members penetration. Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sal es decreased 32 basis points for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. This decrease was primarily the result of a charge of approximately $50 million related to lease exit costs in the prior comparable period, partially offset by a reduction in tobacco sales. As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income increased $126 million for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. 27 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Three months ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,563 $ 5,161 Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion and $5.2 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in inventory related to accelerated buying in certain categories, the timing of sell through for summer seasonal merchandise and increased eCommerce fulfillment center mirroring, as well as the timing of payments. Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Cash and cash equivalents were $9.3 billion and $7.9 billion at April 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Our working capital deficit was $18.1 billion and $21.5 billion at April 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. The decreased working capital deficit at April 30, 2019 compared to April 30, 2018 was primarily due to higher current assets as a result of the consolidation of Flipkart. We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S. We are awaiting anticipated technical guidance from the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. We do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. As of April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.7 billion at April 30, 2019 , approximately $1.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Three months ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,135 ) $ (1,682 ) Net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $0.5 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , primarily as a result of proceeds received from the sale of our Canada bank. These proceeds were partially offset by an increase in investments in eCommerce, technology and supply chain as well as payments to remodel existing stores and clubs. 28 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Three months ended April 30, (Amounts in millions) 2019 2018 Net cash used in financing activities $ (846 ) $ (2,486 ) Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities decreased $1.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to $4.0 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt to fund general business operations, along with a reduction in the repayment of long-term debt. This decrease in net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by cash outflows related to changes in short term borrowings and an increase in share repurchases, due to the prior year suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the Flipkart announcement. Additionally, the Company has committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion as of April 30, 2019 and January 31, 2019 , respectively, all undrawn. Long-term Debt The following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for the three months ended April 30, 2019 : (Amounts in millions) Long-term debt due within one year Long-term debt Total Balances as of February 1, 2019 $ 1,876 $ 43,520 $ 45,396 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt — 3,978 3,978 Repayments of long-term debt (364 ) — (364 ) Other (48 ) (73 ) (121 ) Balances as of April 30, 2019 $ 1,464 $ 47,425 $ 48,889 Our total outstanding long-term debt balance increased $3.5 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , primarily due to the net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt to fund general business operations. Dividends On February 19, 2019 , the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2020 annual dividend of $ 2.12 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2019 annual dividend of $2.08 per share. For fiscal 2020 , the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.53 per share, according to the following record and payable dates: Record Date Payable Date March 15, 2019 April 1, 2019 May 10, 2019 June 3, 2019 August 9, 2019 September 3, 2019 December 6, 2019 January 2, 2020 The dividend installments payable on April 1, 2019 and June 3, 2019 were paid as scheduled. Company Share Repurchase Program From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended April 30, 2019, were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of April 30, 2019 , authorization for $9.2 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. 29 Table of Contents We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for the three months ended April 30, 2019 and 2018 : Three months ended April 30, (Amounts in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 Total number of shares repurchased 21.7 5.5 Average price paid per share $ 98.22 $ 97.75 Total amount paid for share repurchases $ 2,135 $ 539 Share repurchases increased $1.6 billion for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, due to the prior year suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the Flipkart announcement. Capital Resources We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases. We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. At April 30, 2019 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows: Rating agency Commercial paper Long-term debt Standard & Poor's A-1+ AA Moody's Investors Service P-1 Aa2 Fitch Ratings F1+ AA Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

Financial Statements ,"" we discuss, under the sub-caption ""FCPA Investigation and Related Matters,"" our existing FCPA investigation and related matters and possible effects of those matters on Walmart's business including certain risks arising therefrom. In that Note 7 , we also discuss, under the sub-caption ""ASDA Equal Value Claims,"" certain existing employment claims against ASDA including certain risks arising therefrom. Further, in that Note 7 , we also discuss, under the sub-caption "" National Prescription Opiate Litigation and Related Matters ,"" the National Prescription Opiate Litigation and related matters including certain risks arising therefrom.

Legal Proceedings ,"" under the sub-caption ""II. Certain Other Proceedings."" The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution. 30 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates or the market value of our investments. Our market risks at April 30, 2019 are similar to those disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 . The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 , as filed with the SEC on March 28, 2019, under the caption ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,"" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Item 4. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and implemented new systems and internal controls in conjunction with the new lease standard. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and they allow us to continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting and ensure that they remain effective. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 31 Table of Contents PART II.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., USDC, Western Dist. of AR; 5/7/12. III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations. In September 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified the Company that it had initiated an administrative penalty action by issuing a Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order. The letter accompanying the Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order alleges that the Company distributed and/or sold three unregistered pesticide products from March to June 2017. The EPA is seeking a penalty of $960,000. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for ensuring that a FIFRA-regulated product is properly registered prior to its sale. The Company is cooperating with the EPA. In January 2018, the Environmental Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuraduría Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of $163,000 for the absence of an Environmental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company is challenging the fine and denies any wrongdoing. In April 2017, the California Air Resources Board (""ARB"") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimed deposits collected on sales of small containers of automotive refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs. The ARB alleged that the Company had improperly retained approximately $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and has sought reimbursement. The Company has denied any wrongdoing. In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming. 32 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 , which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended April 30, 2019, were made under the current $20.0 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. As of April 30, 2019 , authorization for $9.2 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended April 30, 2019 , was as follows: Fiscal Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) (billions) February 1 - 28, 2019 7,128,747 $ 96.64 7,128,747 $ 10.6 March 1 - 31, 2019 7,403,068 98.29 7,403,068 9.9 April 1 - 30, 2019 6,670,955 100.62 6,670,955 9.2 Total 21,202,770 21,202,770 (1) Represents approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the plan in effect at the end of the month.

However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. Note 2 — New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2022-04, Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires an entity to report information about its supplier finance program. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's condensed consolidated financial statements. 9 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 3 — Revenue Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements.

As a result, $ 30 million of sales in the third quarter of 2022 and $ 87 million in the first nine months of 2022 were moved from Rapid Diagnostics to Heart Failure. Remaining Performance Obligations As of September 30, 2023, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 4.2 billion in the Diagnostics segment and approximately $ 456 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 59 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, approximately 17 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. 11 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) Other Contract Assets and Liabilities Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and the end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: (in millions) Contract Liabilities: Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 500 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period 346 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ( 292 ) Balance at September 30, 2023 $ 554 Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $ 1.431 billion and $ 1.429 billion, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $ 4.113 billion and $ 5.876 billion, respectively. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first nine months of 2023 includes $ 302 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 1.180 billion. The first nine months of 2022 includes $ 362 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 987 million. The following summarizes the activity for the first nine months of 2023 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2023: (in millions) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 262 Provisions/charges to income 22 Amounts charged off and other deductions ( 25 ) Balance at September 30, 2023 $ 259 The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. 12 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) The components of long-term investments as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows: (in millions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Long-term Investments: Equity securities $ 566 $ 558 Other 222 208 Total $ 788 $ 766 The increase in Abbott’s long-term investments as of September 30, 2023 versus the balance as of December 31, 2022 is primarily due to investments acquired as part of a business acquisition and other additional investments, partially offset by the impact of equity method investment losses. Abbott’s equity securities as of September 30, 2023 include $ 291 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. Abbott also holds certain investments as of September 30, 2023 with a carrying value of $ 175 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $ 87 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value.

Note 6 — Business Acquisitions On September 22, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc. (Bigfoot), which will further Abbott's efforts to develop connected solutions for making diabetes management even more personal and precise. The purchase price, the allocation of acquired assets and liabilities, and the revenue and net income contributed by Bigfoot since the date of acquisition are not material to Abbott's condensed consolidated financial statements. On April 27, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI) for $ 20 per common share, which equated to a purchase price of $ 851 million. The transaction was funded with cash on hand and accounted for as a business combination. CSI's atherectomy system, which is used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease, adds complementary technologies to Abbott's portfolio of vascular device offerings. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price of the CSI acquisition resulted in the recording of two non-deductible developed technology intangible assets of $ 305 million; non-deductible in-process research and development of $ 15 million, which will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation; non-deductible goodwill of approximately $ 384 million; net deferred tax assets of approximately $ 31 million and other net assets of approximately $ 116 million. The goodwill is identifiable to the Medical Devices reportable segment and is attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation of assets and liabilities is completed. Revenues and earnings of CSI included in Abbott's consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date are not material to Abbott's consolidated revenue and earnings. If the acquisition of CSI had taken place as of the beginning of 2022, consolidated net sales and earnings would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. Note 7 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 23.3 billion at September 30, 2023 and $ 22.8 billion at December 31, 2022. Recent business acquisitions increased goodwill by approximately $ 590 million and f oreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $ 112 million in the first nine months of 2023. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at September 30, 2023 was $ 2.6 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 285 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.5 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.8 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There were no reductions of goodwill relating to impairments in the first nine months of 2023. 14 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 7 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $ 27.5 billion and $ 27.2 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets increased by $ 305 million due to a recent business acquisition. Accumulated amortization was $ 19.0 billion and $ 17.6 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $ 14 million in the first nine months of 2023. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.0 billion in 2023, $ 1.9 billion in 2024, $ 1.7 billion in 2025, $ 1.6 billion in 2026 and $ 1.3 billion in 2027. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 832 million as of September 30, 2023 and $ 807 million as of December 31, 2022 . Recent business acquisitions increased IPR&D by $ 80 million. This increase was partially offset by $ 55 million of charges recorded on the Research and development line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the impairment of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Medical Devices reportable segment. Note 8 — Restructuring Plans In 2022 and 2023, Abbott management approved various plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its medical devices, nutritional, diagnostic, and established pharmaceutical businesses. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $ 102 million, of which approximately $ 31 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 16 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $ 55 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, Abbott recognized fixed asset impairment charges of approximately $ 29 million related to these restructuring plans. The following summarizes the activity related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accruals as of September 30, 2023: (in millions) Total Accrued balance at December 31, 2022 $ 228 Restructuring charges in 2023 102 Payments and other adjustments ( 181 ) Accrued balance at September 30, 2023 $ 149 Note 9 — Incentive Stock Programs In the first nine months of 2023, Abbott granted 1,986,671 stock options, 463,856 restricted stock awards and 4,927,476 restricted stock units under its incentive stock program. At September 30, 2023, approximately 74 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2023 is as follows: Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 29,342,041 24,718,236 Weighted average remaining life (years) 5.0 4.3 Weighted average exercise price $ 73.77 $ 66.27 Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions) $ 825 $ 825 The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at September 30, 2023 amounted to approximately $ 560 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . 15 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 10 — Debt and Lines of Credit On September 27, 2023, Abbott repaid the € 1.14 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.875 % Notes upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $ 1.2 billion. In September 2023, Abbott repaid approximately $ 197 million of debt assumed as part of a recent business acquisition. On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55 % Notes upon maturity. Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 7.3 billion at September 30, 2023 and $ 7.7 billion at December 31, 2022, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of September 30, 2023 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Abbott held the gross notional amounts of $ 14.2 billion and $ 12.0 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5 -year term loan of approximately $ 401 million and $ 446 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts with a notional amount totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. 16 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative and non-derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022: Fair Value - Assets Fair Value - Liabilities (in millions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Balance Sheet Caption September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Balance Sheet Caption Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges: Non-current $ — $ — Deferred income taxes and other assets $ 158 $ 136 Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Current — — Prepaid expenses and other receivables 13 20 Other accrued liabilities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: Hedging instruments 254 304 Prepaid expenses and other receivables 63 96 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges 113 108 Prepaid expenses and other receivables 115 130 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary — — n/a 401 446 Long-term debt $ 367 $ 412 $ 750 $ 828 17 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

A loss of $ 4 million and a gain of $ 225 million were recognized in the first nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as a hedge. These amounts are reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line. The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are shown in the following table. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions. Abbott does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.

The fair value of debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. The decrease in the amount of contingent consideration from December 31, 2022 reflects the impact of projected timeline changes for events that will trigger payment of contingent consideration, partially offset by additional contingent consideration due to a recent business acquisition. 19 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 12 — Litigation and Environmental Matters Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 25 million to $ 35 million. The recorded accrual balance at September 30, 2023 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 30 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Note 13 — Post-Employment Benefits Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: Defined Benefit Plans Medical and Dental Plans Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 Service cost - benefits earned during the period $ 56 $ 92 $ 174 $ 282 $ 10 $ 13 $ 29 $ 38 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations 114 74 342 225 15 9 45 27 Expected return on plan assets ( 244 ) ( 231 ) ( 729 ) ( 701 ) ( 6 ) ( 8 ) ( 18 ) ( 23 ) Curtailment gain — — ( 14 ) — — — — — Net amortization of: Actuarial loss, net 2 58 8 174 ( 1 ) 2 ( 2 ) 8 Prior service cost (credit) 1 — 1 1 ( 3 ) ( 6 ) ( 10 ) ( 18 ) Net cost (credit) $ ( 71 ) $ ( 7 ) $ ( 218 ) $ ( 19 ) $ 15 $ 10 $ 44 $ 32 Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to Internal Revenue Service funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, $ 302 million and $ 362 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans. In the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, $ 28 million was contributed, in each year, to the post-employment medical and dental plans. 20 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 14 — Taxes on Earnings Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, taxes on earnings include approximately $ 11 million and $ 36 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, taxes on earnings also include approximately $ 59 million and $ 20 million, respectively, of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $ 55 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In September 2023, Abbott received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (SNOD) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2019 Federal tax year in the amount of $ 417 million. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD relate to the reallocation of income between Abbott’s U.S. entities and its foreign affiliates. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit, in part because certain adjustments contradict methods that were agreed to with the IRS in prior audit periods. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. Abbott expects to file a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the 2019 SNOD in December of 2023. Abbott’s 2017 and 2018 Federal tax years are also currently under examination by the IRS with respect to income reallocation issues similar to those included in the 2019 Federal tax year. Abbott intends to vigorously defend its filing positions through ongoing discussions with the IRS, the IRS independent appeals process and/or through litigation as necessary. Abbott reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Abbott continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate. The Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD) has proposed a two-pillared plan for a revised international tax system. Pillar 1 proposes to reallocate taxing rights among the jurisdictions in which in-scope multinational corporations operate. Abbott is continuing to analyze the Pillar 1 proposal. Pillar 2 proposes to assess a 15% minimum tax on the earnings of in-scope multinational corporations on a country-by-country basis. Numerous countries have indicated their intent to adopt the proposal and are drafting legislation to implement the Pillar 2 model rules with a subset of the rules becoming effective January 1, 2024, and the remaining rules becoming effective January 1, 2025, or in later periods. Abbott is also continuing to analyze the Pillar 2 model rules. Implementation of the OECD proposal may have a material impact on Abbott’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the future. 21 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 15 — Segment Information Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Review — Results of Operations Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals.

As a result, $30 million of sales in the third quarter of 2022 and $87 million in the first nine months of 2022 were moved from Diagnostic Products to Medical Devices. In order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates, current year U.S. dollar sales are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates. n/m = Percent change is not meaningful 24 Table of Contents The 1.2 percent decrease in total net sales during the third quarter of 2023, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflected the decrease in demand for Abbott’s rapid diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19, partially offset by higher growth across other businesses. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $305 million during the third quarter of 2023 and approximately $1.7 billion during the third quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 12.6 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 14.1 percent. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the third quarter as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 2.2 percent and total sales by 1.4 percent. The 8.6 percent decrease in total net sales during the first nine months of 2023, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflected lower demand for Abbott’s COVID-19 tests, partially offset by higher growth across other businesses. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $1.3 billion during the first nine months of 2023 and approximately $7.3 billion during the first nine months of 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 8.8 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 11.8 percent. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first nine months as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 4.1 percent and total sales by 2.4 percent. Due to the unpredictability of demand for COVID-19 tests, the future extent to which COVID-19 will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. The table below provides detail by sales category for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers.

As a result, $87 million of sales for the first nine months of 2022 were moved from Rapid Diagnostics to Heart Failure. 25 Table of Contents Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in Key Emerging Markets for Established Pharmaceutical Products increased 10.0 percent in the first nine months of 2023, led by growth in several countries and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, women's health, and central nervous system/pain management. Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased by 17.1 percent in the first nine months of 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total Nutritional Products sales in the first nine months of 2023 increased 11.2 percent. The 32.8 percent increase in U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales in the first nine months of 2023 reflects progress in recovering market share in 2023 following the voluntary recall of certain infant formula products in the first quarter of 2022, as well as the unfavorable 2022 impact of the recall, partially offset by a decrease in 2023 Pedialyte ® sales. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, the 2.9 percent increase in International Pediatric Nutritional sales in the first nine months of 2023 primarily reflects growth in various markets, partially offset by the impact of exiting the pediatric nutrition business in China. The increases of 6.4 percent in U.S. Adult Nutritionals and 7.9 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, in International Adult Nutritionals in the first nine months of 2023 were led by growth of Ensure ® and Glucerna ® products. The 42.1 percent decrease in Diagnostic Products sales in the first nine months of 2023, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was driven by lower demand for COVID-19 tests. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales decreased 65.6 percent in the first nine months of 2023, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to lower demand for COVID-19 tests. In the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $1.2 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. In the first nine months of 2023, Rapid Diagnostics sales increased 6.5 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 8.2 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, sales increased 8.1 percent in the first nine months of 2023, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the higher volume of routine diagnostic testing performed in hospitals and other laboratories, partially offset by lower test sales for the detection of COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibodies. In the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, Core Laboratory Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $16 million and $51 million, respectively. In the first nine months of 2023, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 5.6 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 9.2 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. In the third quarter of 2023, Core Laboratory Diagnostics received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for its Alinity ® h-series hematology system, which integrates hematology workflow from high-throughput Complete Blood Count analysis to automated slide making and staining. The 47.5 percent decrease in Molecular Diagnostics sales in the first nine months of 2023, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by lower demand for laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19, as well as lower demand for respiratory testing compared to significantly higher-than-usual demand in the first nine months of 2022. In the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $36 million and $375 million, respectively. In the first nine months of 2023, Molecular Diagnostics sales decreased 12.8 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and decreased 11.3 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 14.6 percent in the first nine months of 2023, led by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Heart Failure, Neuromodulation and Electrophysiology . Higher Diabetes Care sales were driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, in the U.S. and internationally. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $3.9 billion in the first nine months of 2023, which reflected a 26.2 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over the first nine months of 2022 when FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $3.1 billion. During the first nine months of 2023, procedure volumes increased across the cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses. In Structural Heart, the 15.3 percent increase in sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects continued growth of the MitraClip ® product along with contributions from various products, including Amulet ® , Navitor ® , and TriClip ® . In Vascular, the 8.8 percent increase in sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, during the first nine months of 2023 reflects the acquisition of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI) on April 27, 2023, as well as double-digit growth in endovascular sales . In Electrophysiology, the 14.1 percent increase in sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, primarily reflects higher procedure volumes in the U.S., China, and various European countries. In Neuromodulation, the 15.5 percent increase in sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by the recent launch of the Eterna ® rechargeable spinal cord stimulation system for the treatment of chronic pain along with market growth compared to the prior year period. 26 Table of Contents In the first nine months of 2023, Medical Devices received various product approvals. In January 2023, Abbott announced that the U.S. FDA had approved Navitor, Abbott's second-generation transcatheter aortic valve implantation system to treat people with severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme risk for open-heart surgery. In March 2023, Abbott's Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring system received U.S. FDA clearance for integration with automated insulin delivery systems. In March 2023, the U.S. FDA approved Abbott's Epic ® Max stented tissue valve to treat people with aortic regurgitation or stenosis. In May 2023, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval of its TactiFlex ® Ablation Catheter, Sensor Enabled™, the world's first ablation catheter with a flexible electrode tip and contact force sensing technology to treat patients with atrial fibrillation. In June 2023, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval of its AVEIR™ dual chamber leadless pacemaker system, the world's first dual chamber leadless pacing system that treats people with abnormal or slow heart rhythms. In July 2023, Abbott obtained CE Mark for its AVEIR single-chamber leadless pacemaker. The gross profit margin percentage was 49.7 percent for the third quarter of 2023 compared to 50.7 percent for the third quarter of 2022 and 50.1 percent for the first nine months of 2023 compared to 52.1 percent for the first nine months of 2022. The decrease in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 reflects the unfavorable effects of lower sales of COVID-19 tests, foreign exchange, and higher costs for various manufacturing inputs, partially offset by the impact in 2022 of the voluntary product recall in the Nutritional business and the impact in 2023 of gross margin improvement initiatives. Research and development (R&D) expenses decreased $110 million, or 14.0 percent, in the third quarter of 2023 and decreased $122 million, or 5.6 percent, in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the prior year. The decrease in R&D expense in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 was primarily driven by the non-recurrence of an impairment charge recognized in 2022 related to in-process R&D assets acquired in a previous business combination. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8 million, or 0.3 percent, in the third quarter of 2023, and decreased $50 million, or 0.6 percent, in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the prior year. Higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses was offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The decrease during the first nine months of 2023 also reflects the non-recurrence of 2022 expenses related to the voluntary product recall in the Nutritional segment. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net decreased from $86 million in the third quarter of 2022 to $69 million in the third quarter of 2023 and decreased from $309 million in the first nine months of 2022 to $182 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decreases were due to the favorable impact of higher interest rates on interest income, partially offset by the negative impact of interest rate hedge contracts related to certain fixed-rate debt. Other (Income) Expense, net Other income, net decreased from $93 million of income in the third quarter of 2022 to $83 million of income in the third quarter of 2023 and increased from $253 million of income in the first nine months of 2022 to $370 million of income in the first nine months of 2023. The third quarter and the first nine months of 2023 reflect higher income in 2023 related to the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs. In the third quarter of 2023, the decline in Other income, net is due to higher impairment charges related to long term investments that more than offset the increase in income associated with the non-service component of pension and post-retirement medical plans. Taxes on Earnings Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, taxes on earnings include approximately $11 million and $36 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first nine months of 2023 and 2022, taxes on earnings also include approximately $59 million and $20 million, respectively, of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $55 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. 27 Table of Contents In September 2023, Abbott received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (SNOD) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2019 Federal tax year in the amount of $417 million. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD relate to the reallocation of income between Abbott’s U.S. entities and its foreign affiliates. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit, in part because certain adjustments contradict methods that were agreed to with the IRS in prior audit periods. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. Abbott expects to file a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the 2019 SNOD in December of 2023. Abbott’s 2017 and 2018 Federal tax years are also currently under examination by the IRS with respect to income reallocation issues similar to those included in the 2019 Federal tax year. Abbott intends to vigorously defend its filing positions through ongoing discussions with the IRS, the IRS independent appeals process and/or through litigation as necessary. Abbott reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Abbott continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate. The Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD) has proposed a two-pillared plan for a revised international tax system. Pillar 1 proposes to reallocate taxing rights among the jurisdictions in which in-scope multinational corporations operate. Abbott is continuing to analyze the Pillar 1 proposal. Pillar 2 proposes to assess a 15% minimum tax on the earnings of in-scope multinational corporations on a country-by-country basis. Numerous countries have indicated their intent to adopt the proposal and are drafting legislation to implement the Pillar 2 model rules with a subset of the rules becoming effective January 1, 2024, and the remaining rules becoming effective January 1, 2025, or in later periods. Abbott is also continuing to analyze the Pillar 2 model rules. Implementation of the OECD proposal may have a material impact on Abbott’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources September 30, 2023 Compared with December 31, 2022 The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $9.9 billion at December 31, 2022 to $6.7 billion at September 30, 2023 primarily reflects the payment of dividends, the repayment of debt, share repurchases, the cost of business acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by the cash generated from operations in the first nine months of 2023. Working capital was $9.6 billion at September 30, 2023 and $9.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The decrease in working capital in 2023 primarily reflects a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, which was nearly offset by increases in accounts receivables and inventory and decreases in the current portion of long-term debt, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months of 2023 totaled approximately $4.2 billion, a decrease of $3.0 billion from the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the decline in operating earnings and an increase in cash taxes paid. Net cash from operating activities in 2023 includes $302 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $1.180 billion. Net cash from operating activities in 2022 includes $362 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $987 million. On September 27, 2023, Abbott repaid the €1.14 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.875% Notes upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $1.2 billion. In September 2023, Abbott repaid approximately $197 million of debt assumed as part of a recent business acquisition. On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55% Notes upon maturity. In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. As of September 30, 2023, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion authorization remains available. At September 30, 2023, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by S&P Global Ratings and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2025. 28 Table of Contents In the first nine months of 2023, Abbott repurchased approximately 7 million of its common shares for $725 million. As of September 30, 2023 , $1.709 billion remains available for repurchase under the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in December 2021. In each of the first three quarters of 2023, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of 8.5 percent over the $0.47 per share dividend declared in each of the first three quarters of 2022. Business Acquisitions On September 22, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc. (Bigfoot), which will further Abbott's efforts to develop connected solutions for making diabetes management even more personal and precise. The purchase price, the allocation of acquired assets and liabilities, and the revenue and net income contributed by Bigfoot since the date of acquisition are not material to Abbott's condensed consolidated financial statements. On April 27, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of CSI for $20 per common share, which equated to a purchase price of $851 million. The transaction was funded with cash on hand and accounted for as a business combination. CSI's atherectomy system, which is used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease, adds complementary technologies to Abbott's portfolio of vascular device offerings. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price of the CSI acquisition resulted in the recording of two non-deductible developed technology intangible assets of $305 million; non-deductible in-process research and development of $15 million, which will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation; non-deductible goodwill of approximately $384 million; net deferred tax assets of approximately $31 million and other net assets of approximately $116 million. The goodwill is identifiable to the Medical Devices reportable segment and is attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation of assets and liabilities is completed. Revenues and earnings of CSI included in Abbott's consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date are not material to Abbott's consolidated revenue and earnings. If the acquisition of CSI had taken place as of the beginning of 2022, consolidated net sales and earnings would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. Legislative Issues Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and are incorporated herein by reference. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. 29 Table of Contents PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Robert B. Ford, and Chief Financial Officer, Philip P. Boudreau, evaluated the effectiveness of Abbott Laboratories’ disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that Abbott Laboratories’ disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information Abbott is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Abbott in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Abbott’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, there were no changes in Abbott’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Abbott’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Abbott is involved in various claims, legal proceedings and investigations as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Item 2.

However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. Note 2 — New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2022-04, Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires an entity to report information about its supplier finance program. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's condensed consolidated financial statements. 9 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 3 — Revenue Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.

As a result, $ 28 million of sales in the second quarter of 2022 and $ 57 million in the first six months of 2022 were moved from Rapid Diagnostics to Heart Failure. Remaining Performance Obligations As of June 30, 2023, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 4.2 billion in the Diagnostics segment and approximately $ 475 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 59 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, approximately 17 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. 11 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) Other Contract Assets and Liabilities Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and the end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: (in millions) Contract Liabilities: Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 500 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period 243 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ( 192 ) Balance at June 30, 2023 $ 551 Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $ 1.370 billion and $ 2.009 billion, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $ 2.682 billion and $ 4.447 billion, respectively. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first six months of 2023 includes $ 290 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 837 million. The first six months of 2022 includes $ 348 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 657 million. The following summarizes the activity for the first six months of 2023 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of June 30, 2023: (in millions) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 262 Provisions/charges to income 16 Amounts charged off and other deductions ( 12 ) Balance at June 30, 2023 $ 266 The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. 12 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) The components of long-term investments as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows: (in millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Long-term Investments: Equity securities $ 574 $ 558 Other 225 208 Total $ 799 $ 766 The increase in Abbott’s long-term investments as of June 30, 2023 versus the balance as of December 31, 2022 is primarily due to investments acquired as part of a business acquisition and other additional investments, partially offset by the impact of equity method investment losses. Abbott’s equity securities as of June 30, 2023 include $ 305 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. Abbott also holds certain investments as of June 30, 2023 with a carrying value of $ 164 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $ 95 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. Note 5 — Changes In Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows: Three Months Ended June 30 Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation (Loss) Adjustments Net Actuarial (Losses) and Prior Service (Costs) and Credits Cumulative Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges and Other (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 Balance at March 31 $ ( 6,594 ) $ ( 5,945 ) $ ( 1,491 ) $ ( 2,608 ) $ 46 $ 79 Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ( 52 ) ( 315 ) 1 13 80 45 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income — — ( 7 ) 41 ( 54 ) ( 16 ) Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ( 52 ) ( 315 ) ( 6 ) 54 26 29 Balance at June 30 $ ( 6,646 ) $ ( 6,260 ) $ ( 1,497 ) $ ( 2,554 ) $ 72 $ 108 13 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 5 — Changes In Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (Continued) Six Months Ended June 30 Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation (Loss) Adjustments Net Actuarial (Losses) and Prior Service (Costs) and Credits Cumulative Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges and Other (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 Balance at January 1 $ ( 6,733 ) $ ( 5,839 ) $ ( 1,493 ) $ ( 2,670 ) $ 175 $ 135 Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 87 ( 421 ) 3 30 38 11 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income — — ( 7 ) 86 ( 141 ) ( 38 ) Net current period comprehensive income (loss) 87 ( 421 ) ( 4 ) 116 ( 103 ) ( 27 ) Balance at June 30 $ ( 6,646 ) $ ( 6,260 ) $ ( 1,497 ) $ ( 2,554 ) $ 72 $ 108 Reclassified amounts for cash flow hedges are recorded as Cost of products sold. Net actuarial losses and prior service cost are included as a component of net periodic benefit costs; see Note 13 for additional details. Note 6 — Business Acquisition On April 27, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc (CSI) for $ 20 per common share, which equated to a purchase price of $ 851 million. The transaction was funded with cash on hand and accounted for as a business combination. CSI's atherectomy system, which is used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease, adds complimentary technologies to Abbott's portfolio of vascular device offerings. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition resulted in the recording of a non-deductible developed technology intangible asset of $ 290 million; non-deductible in-process research and development of $ 60 million, which will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation; non-deductible goodwill of approximately $ 340 million; net deferred tax assets of approximately $ 18 million and other net assets of approximately $ 143 million. The goodwill is identifiable to the Medical Devices reportable segment and is attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation of assets and liabilities is completed. Revenues and earnings of CSI included in Abbott's consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date are not material to Abbott's consolidated revenue and earnings. If the acquisition of CSI had taken place as of the beginning of 2022, consolidated net sales and earnings would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. Note 7 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 23.3 billion at June 30, 2023 and $ 22.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The acquisition of CSI increased goodwill by approximately $ 340 million and f oreign currency translation adjustments increased goodwill by approximately $ 120 million in the first six months of 2023. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at June 30, 2023 was $ 2.7 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.5 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.7 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first six months of 2023. 14 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 7 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued) The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $ 27.7 billion and $ 27.2 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets increased by $ 290 million due to the CSI acquisition. Accumulated amortization was $ 18.7 billion and $ 17.6 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Foreign currency translation adjustments increased intangible assets by $ 47 million in the first six months of 2023. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.0 billion in 2023, $ 1.9 billion in 2024, $ 1.7 billion in 2025, $ 1.6 billion in 2026 and $ 1.3 billion in 2027. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 822 million as of June 30, 2023 and $ 807 million as of December 31, 2022 . In the second quarter of 2023, the acquisition of CSI increased IPR&D by $ 60 million. This increase was partially offset by $ 45 million of charges recorded on the Research and development line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings for the impairment of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Medical Devices reportable segment. Note 8 — Restructuring Plans In 2022 and 2023, Abbott management approved various plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its medical devices, nutritional, diagnostic, and established pharmaceutical businesses. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $ 49 million, of which approximately $ 17 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 5 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $ 27 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, Abbott recognized fixed asset impairment charges of approximately $ 17 million related to these restructuring plans. The following summarizes the activity related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accruals as of June 30, 2023: (in millions) Total Accrued balance at December 31, 2022 $ 228 Restructuring charges in 2023 49 Payments and other adjustments ( 120 ) Accrued balance at June 30, 2023 $ 157 Note 9 — Incentive Stock Programs In the first six months of 2023, Abbott granted 1,973,371 stock options, 460,447 restricted stock awards and 4,854,027 restricted stock units under its incentive stock program. At June 30, 2023, approximately 74 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2023 is as follows: Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 29,508,026 24,819,977 Weighted average remaining life (years) 5.2 4.5 Weighted average exercise price $ 73.66 $ 66.04 Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions) $ 1,107 $ 1,101 The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at June 30, 2023 amounted to approximately $ 660 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . 15 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 10 — Debt and Lines of Credit On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55 % Notes upon maturity. Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 7.1 billion at June 30, 2023 and $ 7.7 billion at December 31, 2022, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of June 30, 2023 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Abbott held the gross notional amounts of $ 12.3 billion and $ 12.0 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5 -year term loan of approximately $ 413 million and $ 446 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts with a notional amount totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. 16 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative and non-derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022: Fair Value - Assets Fair Value - Liabilities (in millions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Balance Sheet Caption June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Balance Sheet Caption Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges: Non-current $ — $ — Deferred income taxes and other assets $ 142 $ 136 Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Current — — Prepaid expenses and other receivables 11 20 Other accrued liabilities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: Hedging instruments 147 304 Prepaid expenses and other receivables 129 96 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges 78 108 Prepaid expenses and other receivables 62 130 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary — — n/a 413 446 Long-term debt $ 225 $ 412 $ 757 $ 828 17 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

A loss of $ 64 million and a gain of $ 252 million were recognized in the first six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as a hedge. These amounts are reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line. The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are shown in the following table. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values.

The fair value of debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. The change in fair value from December 31, 2022 reflects changes in the projected timelines for events that will trigger payment of contingent consideration. 19 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 12 — Litigation and Environmental Matters Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 25 million to $ 35 million. The recorded accrual balance at June 30, 2023 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 30 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Note 13 — Post-Employment Benefits Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized for the three and six months ended June 30 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: Defined Benefit Plans Medical and Dental Plans Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 Service cost - benefits earned during the period $ 58 $ 94 $ 118 $ 190 $ 10 $ 12 $ 19 $ 25 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations 114 75 228 151 16 8 30 18 Expected return on plan assets ( 243 ) ( 234 ) ( 485 ) ( 470 ) ( 6 ) ( 8 ) ( 12 ) ( 15 ) Curtailment gain ( 14 ) — ( 14 ) — — — — — Net amortization of: Actuarial loss, net 3 57 6 116 ( 1 ) 1 ( 1 ) 6 Prior service cost (credit) — 1 — 1 ( 4 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 12 ) Net cost (credit) $ ( 82 ) $ ( 7 ) $ ( 147 ) $ ( 12 ) $ 15 $ 7 $ 29 $ 22 Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to Internal Revenue Service funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first six months of 2023 and 2022, $ 290 million and $ 348 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans. In the first six months of 2023 and 2022, $ 28 million was contributed, in each year, to the post-employment medical and dental plans. 20 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 14 — Taxes on Earnings Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first six months of 2023 and 2022, taxes on earnings include approximately $ 9 million and $ 32 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first six months of 2023 and 2022, taxes on earnings also include approximately $ 62 million and $ 27 million, respectively, of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $ 100 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. Note 15 — Segment Information Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Review — Results of Operations Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The following tables detail sales by reportable segment for the three and six months ended June 30. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers.

As a result, $28 million of sales in the second quarter of 2022 and $57 million in the first six months of 2022 were moved from Diagnostic Products to Medical Devices. In order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates, current year U.S. dollar sales are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates. n/m = Percent change is not meaningful 23 Table of Contents The 8.9 percent decrease in total net sales during the second quarter of 2023, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflected the decrease in demand for Abbott’s rapid diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19, partially offset by higher growth across other businesses. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $263 million during the second quarter of 2023 and approximately $2.3 billion during the second quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 8.8 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 11.9 percent. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the second quarter as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 4.4 percent and total sales by 2.5 percent. The 11.9 percent decrease in total net sales during the first six months of 2023, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflected lower demand for Abbott’s COVID-19 tests, partially offset by higher growth across other businesses. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $993 million during the first six months of 2023 and approximately $5.6 billion during the first six months of 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 6.9 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 10.6 percent. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first six months as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 5.0 percent and total sales by 2.9 percent. Due to the unpredictability of demand for COVID-19 tests, the future extent to which COVID-19 will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.

Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased by 16.3 percent in the first six months of 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total Nutritional Products sales in the first six months of 2023 increased 8.5 percent. The 28.6 percent increase in U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales in the first six months of 2023 reflects the unfavorable impact of the voluntary recall of certain infant formula products in the first quarter of 2022 as well as progress in recovering market share in this business following the voluntary recall, partially offset by a decrease in 2023 Pedialyte ® sales. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, the 0.7 percent increase in International Pediatric Nutritional sales in the first six months of 2023 primarily reflects growth in various markets offset by the impact of exiting the pediatric nutrition business in China. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, the increases of 5.8 percent in U.S. Adult Nutritionals and 4.8 percent in International Adult Nutritionals in the first six months of 2023 were led by growth of Ensure ® products. The 46.0 percent decrease in Diagnostic Products sales in the first six months of 2023, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was driven by lower demand for COVID-19 tests. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales decreased 67.9 percent in the first six months of 2023, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to lower demand for COVID-19 tests. In the first six months of 2023 and 2022, Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $954 million and $5.3 billion, respectively. In the first six months of 2023, Rapid Diagnostics sales increased 3.3 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 5.7 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, sales increased 7.3 percent in the first six months of 2023, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the higher volume of routine diagnostic testing performed in hospitals and other laboratories, partially offset by lower test sales for the detection of COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibodies. In the first six months of 2023 and 2022, Core Laboratory Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $11 million and $40 million, respectively. In the first six months of 2023, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 4.2 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 8.6 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. The 53.3 percent decrease in Molecular Diagnostics sales in the first six months of 2023, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by lower demand for laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 as well as lower demand for respiratory testing compared to significantly higher-than-usual demand in the first six months of 2022. In the first six months of 2023 and 2022, Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $28 million and $321 million, respectively. In the first six months of 2023, Molecular Diagnostics sales decreased 16.5 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and decreased 14.5 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 13.9 percent in the first six months of 2023, led by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Heart Failure, Neuromodulation and Electrophysiology. Higher Diabetes Care sales were driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, in the U.S. and internationally. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $2.5 billion in the first six months of 2023, which reflected a 25.1 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over the first six months of 2022 when FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $2.1 billion. During the first six months of 2023, procedure volumes increased across the cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses. In Structural Heart, the 15.5 percent increase in sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects continued growth of the MitraClip ® product along with contributions from recently launched products, including Amulet ® , Navitor ® , and TriClip ® . In Vascular, the 7.9 percent increase in sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, during the first six months of 2023 reflects the acquisition of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI) on April 27, 2023 as well as double-digit growth in endovascular sales. In Electrophysiology, the 12.8 percent increase in sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, primarily reflects higher procedure volumes in the U.S., China, and various European countries. In Neuromodulation, the 13.8 percent increase in sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by the recent launch of the Eterna ® rechargeable spinal cord stimulation system for the treatment of chronic pain along with market growth compared to the prior year period. 25 Table of Contents In the first six months of 2023, Medical Devices received various product approvals. In January 2023, Abbott announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved Navitor, Abbott's second-generation transcatheter aortic valve implantation system to treat people with severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme risk for open-heart surgery. In March 2023, Abbott's Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring system received U.S. FDA clearance for integration with automated insulin delivery systems. In March 2023, the U.S. FDA approved Abbott's Epic ® Max stented tissue valve to treat people with aortic regurgitation or stenosis. In May 2023, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval of its TactiFlex ® Ablation Catheter, Sensor Enabled™, the world's first ablation catheter with a flexible electrode tip and contact force sensing technology to treat patients with atrial fibrillation. In June 2023, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval of its AVEIR ® dual chamber leadless pacemaker system, the world's first dual chamber leadless pacing system that treats people with abnormal or slow heart rhythms. The gross profit margin percentage was 50.1 percent for the second quarter of 2023 compared to 51.7 percent for the second quarter of 2022 and 50.3 percent for the first six months of 2023 compared to 52.8 percent for the first six months of 2022. The decrease in the quarter and first six months of 2023 reflects the unfavorable effects of lower sales of COVID-19 tests, foreign exchange, and higher costs for various manufacturing inputs, partially offset by the impact in 2022 of the voluntary product recall in the Nutritional business and the impact in 2023 of gross margin improvement initiatives. Research and development (R&D) expenses increased $31 million, or 4.5 percent, in the second quarter of 2023 and decreased $12.0 million, or 0.9 percent, in the first six months of 2023 compared to the prior year. The increase in R&D expense in the second quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by impairment charges related to in-process R&D assets acquired in previous business combinations, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The decrease in R&D expense in the first six months of 2023 was primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and the level of spending on various projects, partially offset by the impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $17 million, or 0.6 percent, in the second quarter of 2023, and decreased $42 million, or 0.8 percent, in the first six months of 2023 compared to the prior year. Higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses was offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The decrease during the first six months of 2023 also reflects the nonrecurrence of 2022 expenses related to the voluntary product recall in the Nutritional segment. Other (Income) Expense, net Other income, net increased from $82 million of income in the second quarter of 2022 to $176 million of income in the second quarter of 2023 and from $160 million of income in the first six months of 2022 to $287 million of income in the first six months of 2023. The increases in the second quarter and the first six months of 2023 reflect higher income in 2023 related to the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs, as well as favorable changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities related to previous business combinations. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net declined $45 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $110 million in the first six months of 2023 versus 2022 due to the favorable impact of higher interest rates on interest income, partially offset by the negative impact of interest rate hedge contracts related to certain fixed-rate debt. Taxes on Earnings Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first six months of 2023 and 2022, taxes on earnings include approximately $9 million and $32 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first six months of 2023 and 2022, taxes on earnings also include approximately $62 million and $27 million, respectively, of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $100 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. 26 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources June 30, 2023 Compared with December 31, 2022 The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $9.9 billion at December 31, 2022 to $7.8 billion at June 30, 2023 primarily reflects the payment of dividends, share repurchases, the cost of a business acquisition and capital expenditures, partially offset by the cash generated from operations in the first six months of 2023. Working capital was $9.2 billion at June 30, 2023 and $9.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The decrease in working capital in 2023 primarily reflects a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in inventory and decreases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2023 totaled approximately $2.3 billion, a decrease of $2.1 billion from the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the decline in operating earnings and an increase in cash taxes paid. Net cash from operating activities in 2023 includes $290 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $837 million. Net cash from operating activities in 2022 includes $348 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $657 million. On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55% Notes upon maturity. In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. As of June 30, 2023, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion authorization remains available. At June 30, 2023, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2025. In the first six months of 2023, Abbott repurchased approximately 7 million of its common shares for $725 million. As of June 30, 2023, $1.709 billion remains available for repurchase under the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in December 2021. In each of the first two quarters of 2023, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of 8.5 percent over the $0.47 per share dividend declared in each of the first two quarters of 2022. Business Acquisition On April 27, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of CSI for $20 per common share, which equated to a purchase price of $851 million. The transaction was funded with cash on hand and accounted for as a business combination. CSI's atherectomy system, which is used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease, adds complimentary technologies to Abbott's portfolio of vascular device offerings. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition resulted in the recording of a non-deductible developed technology intangible asset of $290 million; non-deductible in-process research and development of $60 million, which will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval or discontinuation; non-deductible goodwill of approximately $340 million; net deferred tax assets of approximately $18 million and other net assets of approximately $143 million. The goodwill is identifiable to the Medical Devices reportable segment and is attributable to expected synergies from combining operations, as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. Allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation of assets and liabilities is completed. Revenues and earnings of CSI included in Abbott's consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date are not material to Abbott's consolidated revenue and earnings. If the acquisition of CSI had taken place as of the beginning of 2022, consolidated net sales and earnings would not have been significantly different from reported amounts. 27 Table of Contents Legislative Issues Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and are incorporated herein by reference. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. 28 Table of Contents PART I.

However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. Note 2 — New Accounting Standards Recent Adopted Accounting Standards In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2022-04, Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires an entity to report information about its supplier finance program. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2023. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's condensed consolidated financial statements. 8 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 3 — Revenue Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. The following tables provide detail by sales category: Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — Key Emerging Markets $ — $ 912 $ 912 $ — $ 906 $ 906 Other — 277 277 — 241 241 Total — 1,189 1,189 — 1,147 1,147 Nutritionals — Pediatric Nutritionals 459 465 924 338 509 847 Adult Nutritionals 353 690 1,043 339 708 1,047 Total 812 1,155 1,967 677 1,217 1,894 Diagnostics — Core Laboratory 289 893 1,182 268 916 1,184 Molecular 47 100 147 172 248 420 Point of Care 93 41 134 91 37 128 Rapid Diagnostics 906 319 1,225 2,181 1,344 3,525 Total 1,335 1,353 2,688 2,712 2,545 5,257 Medical Devices — Rhythm Management 260 267 527 248 276 524 Electrophysiology 238 267 505 216 269 485 Heart Failure 218 63 281 196 54 250 Vascular 218 399 617 209 410 619 Structural Heart 210 251 461 190 221 411 Neuromodulation 155 41 196 143 36 179 Diabetes Care 479 834 1,313 343 783 1,126 Total 1,778 2,122 3,900 1,545 2,049 3,594 Other 3 — 3 3 — 3 Total $ 3,928 $ 5,819 $ 9,747 $ 4,937 $ 6,958 $ 11,895 Note: The Acelis Connected Health business was internally transferred from Rapid Diagnostics to Heart Failure on January 1, 2023. As a result, $ 29 million of sales for the first quarter of 2022 were moved from Rapid Diagnostics to Heart Failure. Remaining Performance Obligations As of March 31, 2023, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 4.1 billion in the Diagnostics segment and approximately $ 450 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, approximately 17 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. 9 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. Other Contract Assets and Liabilities Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: (in millions) Contract Liabilities: Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 500 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period 122 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ( 93 ) Balance at March 31, 2023 $ 529 Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were $ 1.313 billion and $ 2.438 billion, respectively. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first three months of 2023 includes $ 282 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 122 million. The first three months of 2022 includes $ 334 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 195 million. The following summarizes the activity for the first three months of 2023 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31, 2023: (in millions) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 262 Provisions/charges to income 8 Amounts charged off and other adjustments 2 Balance at March 31, 2023 $ 272 10 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. The components of long-term investments as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows: (in millions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Long-term Investments: Equity securities $ 565 $ 558 Other 211 208 Total $ 776 $ 766 The increase in Abbott’s long-term investments as of March 31, 2023 versus the balance as of December 31, 2022 primarily relates to an increase in the value of securities held in a rabbi trust and additional investments, partially offset by equity method investment losses. Abbott’s equity securities as of March 31, 2023, include $ 305 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. Abbott also holds certain investments as of March 31, 2023 with a carrying value of $ 162 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $ 88 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. Note 5 — Changes In Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows: Three Months Ended March 31 Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation (Loss) Adjustments Net Actuarial (Losses) and Prior Service (Costs) and Credits Cumulative Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges and Other (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 Balance at January 1 $ ( 6,733 ) $ ( 5,839 ) $ ( 1,493 ) $ ( 2,670 ) $ 175 $ 135 Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 139 ( 106 ) 2 17 ( 42 ) ( 34 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income — — — 45 ( 87 ) ( 22 ) Net current period comprehensive income (loss) 139 ( 106 ) 2 62 ( 129 ) ( 56 ) Balance at March 31 $ ( 6,594 ) $ ( 5,945 ) $ ( 1,491 ) $ ( 2,608 ) $ 46 $ 79 11 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 5 — Changes In Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (Continued) Reclassified amounts for cash flow hedges are recorded as Cost of products sold. Net actuarial losses and prior service cost are included as a component of net periodic benefit costs; see Note 12 for additional details. Note 6 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 22.9 billion at March 31, 2023 and $ 22.8 billion at December 31, 2022. Foreign currency translation adjustments increased goodwill by approximately $ 128 million in the first three months of 2023. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at March 31, 2023 was $ 2.7 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.5 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.4 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first three months of 2023. The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $ 27.4 billion and $ 27.2 billion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $ 18.2 billion and $ 17.6 billion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Foreign currency translation adjustments increased intangible assets by $ 43 million in the first three months of 2023. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.0 billion in 2023, $ 1.9 billion in 2024, $ 1.7 billion in 2025, $ 1.5 billion in 2026 and $ 1.2 billion in 2027. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process R&D (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 807 million as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Note 7 — Restructuring Plans In 2022 and 2023, Abbott management approved various plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its medical devices, nutritional, diagnostic, and established pharmaceutical businesses. In the first three months of 2023, Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately $ 17 million, of which approximately $ 6 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, and approximately $ 11 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The following summarizes the activity related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accruals as of March 31, 2023: (in millions) Accrued balance at December 31, 2022 $ 228 Restructuring charges in 2023 17 Payments and other adjustments ( 61 ) Accrued balance at March 31, 2023 $ 184 12 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 8 — Incentive Stock Programs In the first three months of 2023, Abbott granted 1,887,093 stock options, 445,278 restricted stock awards and 4,761,433 restricted stock units under its incentive stock program. At March 31, 2023, approximately 74 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at March 31, 2023 is as follows: Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 29,760,644 25,107,006 Weighted average remaining life (years) 5.4 4.7 Weighted average exercise price $ 73.33 $ 65.76 Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions) $ 947 $ 946 The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at March 31, 2023 amounted to approximately $ 760 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55 % Notes upon maturity. Note 10 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 7.1 billion at March 31, 2023 and $ 7.7 billion at December 31, 2022, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of March 31, 2023 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Abbott held the gross notional amounts of $ 11.4 billion and $ 12.0 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5 -year term loan of approximately $ 451 million and $ 446 million as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts with a notional amount totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. 13 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 10 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022: Fair Value - Assets Fair Value - Liabilities (in millions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Balance Sheet Caption March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Balance Sheet Caption Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges: Non-current $ — $ — Deferred income taxes and other assets $ 126 $ 136 Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Current — — Prepaid expenses and other receivables 21 20 Other accrued liabilities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: Hedging instruments 76 304 Prepaid expenses and other receivables 139 96 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges 78 108 Prepaid expenses and other receivables 96 130 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary — — n/a 451 446 Long-term debt $ 154 $ 412 $ 833 $ 828 The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.

These amounts are reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line. The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are shown in the following table. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions. Abbott does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.

The fair value of debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. Note 11 — Litigation and Environmental Matters Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. 16 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 11 — Litigation and Environmental Matters (Continued) Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 25 million to $ 35 million. The recorded accrual balance at March 31, 2023 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 30 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Note 12 — Post-Employment Benefits Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized for the three months ended March 31 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: Defined Benefit Plans Medical and Dental Plans Three Months Ended March 31 Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Service cost - benefits earned during the period $ 60 $ 96 $ 9 $ 13 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations 114 76 14 10 Expected return on plan assets ( 242 ) ( 236 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) Net amortization of: Actuarial loss, net 3 59 — 5 Prior service cost (credit) — — ( 3 ) ( 6 ) Net cost (credit) $ ( 65 ) $ ( 5 ) $ 14 $ 15 Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to Internal Revenue Service funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first three months of 2023 and 2022, $ 282 million and $ 334 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans. In the first three months of 2023 and 2022, $ 28 million was contributed in each year to the post-employment medical and dental plans. Note 13 — Taxes on Earnings Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2023 and 2022, taxes on earnings include approximately $ 3 million and $ 30 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first three months of 2023 and 2022, taxes on earnings also include approximately $ 22 million and $ 30 million, respectively, of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $ 75 million to $ 80 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. 17 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 14 — Segment Information Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.

Note 15 — Subsequent Event On April 27, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI) for $ 20 per common share, which equated to a purchase price of approximately $ 850 million. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. CSI sells an atherectomy system used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease. The acquisition adds complementary technologies to Abbott’s portfolio of vascular device offerings. The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination. Abbott has begun the process of measuring, as of the acquisition date, the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Preliminary purchase price allocation estimates will be disclosed in Abbott’s Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2023. 19 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Review — Results of Operations Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The following tables detail sales by reportable segment for the three months ended March 31. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. Net Sales to External Customers (in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Total Change Impact of Foreign Exchange Total Change Excl.

As a result, $29 million of sales for the first quarter of 2022 were moved from Diagnostic Products to Medical Devices. In order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates, current year U.S. dollar sales are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates. n/m = Percent change is not meaningful The 14.8 percent decrease in total net sales during the first three months of 2023, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflected the decrease in demand for Abbott’s rapid diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19, partially offset by higher growth across other businesses. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $730 million during the first quarter of 2023 and approximately $3.3 billion during the first quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 4.9 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 9.4 percent. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first quarter as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 5.7 percent and total sales by 3.3 percent. Due to the unpredictability of demand for COVID-19 tests, the future extent to which COVID-19 will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. 20 Table of Contents The table below provides detail by sales category for the three months ended March 31.

As a result, $29 million of sales for the first quarter of 2022 were moved from Rapid Diagnostics to Heart Failure. 21 Table of Contents Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in the Key Emerging Markets for Established Pharmaceutical Products increased 8.3 percent in the first three months of 2023, led by growth in several countries, including Brazil, China and southeast Asia, and across several therapeutic areas, including cardio-metabolic, respiratory, and central nervous system/pain management. Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased by 21.8 percent in the first three months of 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total Nutritional Products sales in the first three months of 2023 increased 7.7 percent . In U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals, the 36.1 percent increase in sales in the first three months of 2023 refle cts the impact of the unfavorable effects of the voluntary recall of certain infant formula products in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by a decrease in 2023 Pedialyte ® sale s. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, the 3.9 percent decrease in International Pediatric Nutritional sales in the first three months of 2023 primarily reflects the impact of exiting the pediatric nutrition business in China, partially offset by growth in several other markets . Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, the increases of 3.9 percent in U.S. Adult Nutritionals and 4.4 percent in International Adult Nutritionals in the first three months of 2023 were led by growth of Ensure ® products. The 47.1 percent decrease in Diagnostic Products sales in the first three months of 2023, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was driven by lower demand for COVID-19 tests. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales decreased 64.5 percent in the first three months of 2023, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to lower demand for COVID-19 tests. In the first three months of 2023 and 2022, Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $704 million and $3.0 billion, respectively. In the first three months of 2023, Rapid Diagnostics sales increased 5.1 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 8.0 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, sales increased 5.1 percent in the first three months of 2023, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the higher volume of routine diagnostic testing performed in hospitals and other laboratories, partially offset by lower test sales for the detection of COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibodies. In the first three months of 2023 and 2022, Core Laboratory Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $6 million and $28 million, respectively. In the first three months of 2023, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 1.7 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 7.1 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. The 64.0 percent decrease in Molecular Diagnostics sales in the first three months of 2023, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by lower demand for laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 as well as lower demand for respiratory testing compared to significantly higher-than-usual demand in the first quarter of 2022. In the first three months of 2023 and 2022, Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $20 million and $246 million, respectively. In the first three months of 2023, Molecular Diagnostics sales decreased 27.1 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and decreased 24.8 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 12.4 percent in the first three months of 2023, led by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Neuromodulation. Higher Diabetes Care sales were driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, in the U.S. and internationally. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $1.2 billion in the first three months of 2023, which reflected a 25.4 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over the first three months of 2022 when FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $1.0 billion. During the first three months of 2023, procedure volumes increased across the cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses. In Structural Heart, the 16.4 percent increase in sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects an acceleration in the growth of the MitraClip ® product along with contributions from recently launched products, including Amulet ® , Navitor ® , and TriClip ® . In Vascular, the 3.9 percent increase in sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, during the first three months of 2023 primarily reflects double-digit growth in endovascular sales. 22 Table of Contents In Electrophysiology, the 8.8 percent increase in sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, primarily reflects higher procedure volumes in various European countries and the U.S. In Neuromodulation the 11.2 percent increase in sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by the recent launch of the Eterna TM rechargeable spinal cord stimulation system for the treatment of chronic pain along with market growth compared to the prior year period. In the first three months of 2023, Medical Devices received various product approvals. In January 2023, Abbott announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved Navitor, Abbott's second-generation transcatheter aortic valve implantation system to treat people with severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme risk for open-heart surgery. In March 2023, Abbott's Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring system received U.S. FDA clearance for integration with automated insulin delivery systems. In March 2023, the U.S. FDA approved Abbott's Epic ® Max stented tissue valve to treat people with aortic regurgitation or stenosis. The gross profit margin percentage was 50.5 percent for the first quarter of 2023 compared to 53.8 percent for the first quarter of 2022. The decrease in the first quarter of 2023 reflects the unfavorable effects of lower sales of COVID-19 tests, foreign exchange, and higher costs for various manufacturing inputs, partially offset by the impact in 2022 of the voluntary product recall in the Nutritional business and the impact in 2023 of gross margin improvement initiatives. Research and development (R&D) expenses decreased $43 million, or 6.2 percent, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year. The decrease in R&D expenses in the first quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by the timing of spending on various projects and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $25 million, or 0.9 percent, in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year as higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses was offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and the nonrecurrence of 2022 expenses related to the product recall in the Nutritional segment. Other (Income) Expense, net Other income, net increased from $78 million of income in the first quarter of 2022 to $111 million of income in the first quarter of 2023. Th e increase in the first quarter of 2023 reflects higher income in 2023 related to the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs. Interest Expense, net Interest expe nse, net decreased $65 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the impact of higher interest rates on interest income, partially offset by the impact of interest rate hedge contracts related to certain fixed-rate debt. Taxes on Earnings Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2023 and 2022, taxes on earnings include approximately $3 million and $30 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first three months of 2023 and 2022, taxes on earnings also include approximately $22 million and $30 million, respectively, of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $75 million to $80 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. 23 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources March 31, 2023 Compared with December 31, 2022 The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $9.9 billion at December 31, 2022 to $9.2 billion at March 31, 2023 primarily reflects the payment of dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures, partially offset by the cash generated from operations in the first three months of 2023. Working capital was $9.8 billion at March 31, 2023 and $9.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in working capital in 2023 primarily reflects an increase in inventory and a decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first three months of 2023 totaled approximately $1.1 billion, which reflects a decrease of $922 million from the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to a decline in operating earnings, partially offset by the timing of the collection of trade receivables and a reduction in cash taxes paid. In the first three months of 2023, Net cash from operating activities includes $282 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $122 million. In the first three months of 2022, Net cash from operating activities includes $334 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $195 million. On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55% Notes upon maturity. In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. As of March 31, 2023, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion authorization remains available. At March 31, 2023, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A1 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2025. In the first quarter of 2023, Abbott repurchased approximately 3 million of its common shares for $300 million. As of March 31, 2023, $2.134 billion remains available for repurchase under the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in December 2021. In the first quarter of 2023, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of 8.5 percent over the $0.47 per share dividend declared in the first quarter of 2022. Business Acquisition On April 27, 2023, Abbott completed the acquisition of Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI) for $20 per common share, which equated to a purchase price of approximately $850 million. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. CSI sells an atherectomy system used in treating peripheral and coronary artery disease. The acquisition adds complementary technologies to Abbott’s portfolio of vascular device offerings. The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination. Legislative Issues Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and are incorporated herein by reference. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. 24 Table of Contents PART I.

(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, there were no changes in Abbott’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Abbott’s internal control over financial reporting.

However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. Note 2 — Revenue Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.

Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, approximately 16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. 10 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 2 — Revenue (Continued) Other Contract Assets and Liabilities Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: (in millions) Contract Liabilities: Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 520 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period 466 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ( 508 ) Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 478 Note 3 — Supplemental Financial Information Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $ 1.429 billion and $ 2.092 billion, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $ 5.876 billion and $ 5.061 billion, respectively. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first nine months of 2022 includes $ 362 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 987 million. The first nine months of 2021 includes $ 366 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 990 million. The following summarizes the activity for the first nine months of 2022 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2022: (in millions) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 313 Provisions/charges to income 10 Amounts charged off and other deductions ( 49 ) Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 274 The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. 11 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 3 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) The components of long-term investments as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows: (in millions) September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Long-term Investments: Equity securities $ 604 $ 748 Other 160 68 Total $ 764 $ 816 The decrease in Abbott’s long-term investments as of September 30, 2022 versus the balance as of December 31, 2021 primarily relates to a decrease in the value of investments held in a rabbi trust and the impact of equity method investment losses partially offset by an investment in long-term time deposits. Abbott’s equity securities as of September 30, 2022, include $ 285 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. Abbott also holds certain investments as of September 30, 2022 with a carrying value of $ 228 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $ 83 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. In September 2021, Abbott acquired 100 percent of Walk Vascular, LLC (Walk Vascular), a commercial-stage medical device company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system designed to remove peripheral blood clots. The purchase price, the allocation of acquired assets and liabilities, and the revenue and net income contributed by Walk Vascular since the date of acquisition are not material to Abbott’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

Net actuarial losses and prior service cost are included as a component of net periodic benefit costs; see Note 11 for additional details. Note 5 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 22.3 billion at September 30, 2022 and $ 23.2 billion at December 31, 2021. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $ 946 million in the first nine months of 2022. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at September 30, 2022 was $ 2.6 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.5 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 15.9 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first nine months of 2022. The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $ 26.9 billion and $ 27.7 billion as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $ 16.9 billion and $ 15.9 billion as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $ 250 million in the first nine months of 2022. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.1 billion in 2022, $ 2.0 billion in 2023, $ 1.9 billion in 2024, $ 1.7 billion in 2025 and $ 1.6 billion in 2026. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process R&D (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 807 million as of September 30, 2022 and $ 919 million as of December 31, 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, $ 111 million of impairment charges were recorded on the Research and development line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings related to certain IPR&D intangible assets associated with the Medical Devices business segment. Note 6 — Restructuring Plans On May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $ 499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter of 2021 included fixed asset write-downs of $ 80 million, inventory-related charges of $ 248 million, and other exit costs, which included contract cancellations and employee-related costs of $ 171 million. 13 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 6 — Restructuring Plans (Continued) In the second half of 2021, as the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 spread and the number of new COVID-19 cases increased significantly, particularly in the U.S., demand for rapid COVID-19 tests increased significantly. As a result, in the second half of 2021, Abbott sold approximately $ 181 million of inventory that was previously estimated to have no net realizable value under the second quarter of 2021 restructuring action. In addition, the estimate of other exit costs was reduced by a net $ 58 million as Abbott fulfilled its purchase obligations under certain contracts for which a liability was recorded in the second quarter of 2021 or Abbott settled with the counterparty in the second half of 2021. The following summarizes the activity related to this restructuring action and the status of the related accruals as of September 30, 2022: (in millions) Inventory- Related Charges Fixed Asset Write-Downs Other Exit Costs Total Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 $ 248 $ 80 $ 113 $ 441 Payments — — ( 90 ) ( 90 ) Other non-cash ( 248 ) ( 80 ) — ( 328 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2021 — — 23 23 Payments and other adjustments — — ( 10 ) ( 10 ) Accrued balance at September 30, 2022 $ — $ — $ 13 $ 13 In 2021, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in Abbott’s diagnostic, established pharmaceutical, and nutritional businesses. In 2022 and 2021, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in its medical devices segment. Abbott recorded employees-related severance and other charges of approximately $ 12 million in the first nine months of 2022 of which approximately $ 5 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 2 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $ 5 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings: (in millions) Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 $ 68 Payments and other adjustments ( 7 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2021 61 Restructuring charges recorded in 2022 12 Payments and other adjustments ( 39 ) Accrued balance at September 30, 2022 $ 34 14 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 7 — Incentive Stock Program In the first nine months of 2022, Abbott granted 2,634,647 stock options, 514,205 restricted stock awards and 5,427,697 restricted stock units under its incentive stock program. At September 30, 2022, approximately 87 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2022 is as follows: Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 29,048,449 23,310,464 Weighted average remaining life (years) 5.4 4.6 Weighted average exercise price $ 70.22 $ 59.69 Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions) $ 901 $ 890 The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at September 30, 2022 amounted to approximately $ 600 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . Note 8 — Debt and Lines of Credit On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55 % Notes upon maturity. Note 9 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 7.9 billion at September 30, 2022 and $ 8.6 billion at December 31, 2021, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of September 30, 2022 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Abbott held the gross notional amounts of $ 10.3 billion and $ 12.2 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5 -year term loan of approximately $ 413 million and $ 521 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts with notional values totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. 15 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 9 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021: Fair Value - Assets Fair Value - Liabilities (in millions) September 30, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021 Balance Sheet Caption September 30, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021 Balance Sheet Caption Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ — $ 87 Deferred income taxes and other assets $ 166 $ — Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: Hedging instruments 760 222 Prepaid expenses and other receivables 66 65 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges 148 70 Prepaid expenses and other receivables 141 32 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary — — n/a 413 521 Long-term debt $ 908 $ 379 $ 786 $ 618 The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

Note 10 — Litigation and Environmental Matters Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. 18 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 10 — Litigation and Environmental Matters (Continued) Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 40 million to $ 50 million. The recorded accrual balance at September 30, 2022 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 45 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Note 11 — Post-Employment Benefits Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: Defined Benefit Plans Medical and Dental Plans Three Months Ended Sept. 30 Nine Months Ended Sept. 30 Three Months Ended Sept. 30 Nine Months Ended Sept. 30 (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Service cost - benefits earned during the period $ 92 $ 98 $ 282 $ 294 $ 13 $ 14 $ 38 $ 42 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations 74 62 225 186 9 8 27 25 Expected return on plan assets ( 231 ) ( 211 ) ( 701 ) ( 633 ) ( 8 ) ( 6 ) ( 23 ) ( 20 ) Net amortization of: Actuarial loss, net 58 79 174 238 2 7 8 21 Prior service cost (credit) — — 1 1 ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 18 ) ( 21 ) Net cost (credit) $ ( 7 ) $ 28 $ ( 19 ) $ 86 $ 10 $ 16 $ 32 $ 47 Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to Internal Revenue Service funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, $ 362 million and $ 366 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans. In the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, $ 28 million and $ 26 million, respectively , were contributed to the post-employment medical and dental plans. Note 12 — Taxes on Earnings Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, taxes on earnings include approximately $ 36 million and $ 97 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first nine months of 2022, taxes on earnings also include approximately $ 20 million of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $ 75 million to $ 100 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. 19 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 13 — Segment Information Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Review — Results of Operations Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The following tables detail sales by reportable segment for the three and nine months ended September 30. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers.

Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $1.7 billion during the third quarter of 2022 and approximately $1.9 billion during the third quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales decreased 3.1 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 3.2 percent. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the third quarter as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 10.0 percent and total sales by 6.0 percent. The 10.9 percent increase in total net sales during the first nine months of 2022, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflected demand for Abbott’s rapid diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19 as well as growth in the Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceutical Products segments partially offset by lower Nutritional Products sales. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $7.3 billion during the first nine months of 2022 and approximately $5.4 billion during the first nine months of 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 0.1 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 4.9 percent. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first nine months as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 7.4 percent and total sales by 4.7 percent. Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the future extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. The table below provides detail by sales category for the nine months ended September 30. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers.

Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased by 9.5 percent in the first nine months of 2022. International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 4.6 percent in the first nine months of 2022 versus the comparable 2021 period. The decrease reflects the impact of challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China partially offset by higher sales volumes in various countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America. International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased 9.0 percent, reflecting double digit growth of the Ensure ® and Glucerna ® brands in several countries in Southeast Asia and China. In the first nine months of 2022, U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 1.0 percent. In U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals, Abbott initiated a voluntary recall in February 2022 of certain infant powder formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan and stopped production at the facility. On May 16, 2022, Abbott entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the steps necessary to resume production and maintain the Sturgis facility and operations. On July 1, Abbott restarted partial production at the facility starting with its specialty formula EleCare ® and metabolic formulas. Subsequently, Abbott restarted Similac ® production. The consent decree does not affect any other Abbott plant or operation. During the first three quarters of 2022, Abbott took various actions to mitigate the impact of the recall on the supply of formula in the U.S. These actions included the shipment of infant formula powder into the U.S. from Abbott's FDA-registered facility in Ireland; prioritization of infant formula production at its Columbus, Ohio facility; conversion of other liquid manufacturing lines into manufacturing Similac liquid ready-to-feed product; increased production of powder infant formula at its Casa Grande, Arizona manufacturing site; and importation of product from its facility in Spain as permitted by the FDA. The 31.7 percent decrease in U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales in the first nine months of 2022 reflects the impact of the recall and the Sturgis production stoppage partially offset by increased demand for Abbott’s Pedialyte ® products. U.S. sales of infant powder formula brands associated with the recall were $277 million and $900 million in the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 23.1 percent increase in Diagnostic Products sales in the first nine months of 2022, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was driven by demand for Abbott’s portfolio of COVID-19 tests in Rapid Diagnostics and growth in routine diagnostic testing in Molecular Diagnostics. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, sales increased 1.6 percent in the first nine months of 2022, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the higher volume of routine diagnostic testing from the continued roll-out of the Alinity ® platform and an expanded menu of tests. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Abbott’s laboratory-based tests for the detection of COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibodies, which determine if someone was previously infected with the COVID-19 virus, as well as market disruptions in China due to COVID-19 quarantine restrictions in various cities primarily during the second quarter of 2022. In the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, Core Laboratory Diagnostics IgG and IgM antibody testing-related sales on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were $51 million and $159 million, respectively. In the first nine months of 2022, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales decreased 1.3 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 4.6 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. The 21.9 percent decrease in Molecular Diagnostics sales in the first nine months of 2022, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by lower demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 partially offset by growth in the base business from increased routine molecular testing . In the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $375 million and $699 million, respectively. In the first nine months of 2022, Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 14.9 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 19.4 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 46.7 percent in the first nine months of 2022, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the demand for Abbott’s COVID-19 tests on its rapid testing platforms, including the Panbio ® system, the ID NOW ® platform, and the BinaxNOW ® COVID-19 Ag Card test. In the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $6.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. In the first nine months of 2022, Rapid Diagnostics sales increased 11.8 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 14.6 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. These increases reflect higher sales 24 Table of Contents of ID NOW tests for flu, strep, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as well as growth in various other Rapid Diagnostics products. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 8.4 percent in the first nine months of 2022, driven by growth in Diabetes Care, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Heart Failure. Growth in Diabetes Care sales was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, in the U.S. and internationally. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $3.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022, which reflected a 22.8 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over the first nine months of 2021 when FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $2.7 billion. During the third quarter of 2022, Abbott launched its FreeStyle Libre 3 system in the U.S., which automatically delivers up-to-the-minute glucose readings and 14-day accuracy in a wearable sensor. During the first nine months of 2022, procedure volumes across Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were negatively impacted by new surges of COVID-19 in various geographies as well as intermittent COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in China and healthcare staffing challenges throughout the nine months. Despite such challenges, overall volume trends improved in several businesses versus the first nine months of 2021. In Electrophysiology, the 8.2 percent growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects the increase in procedure volumes and the continued roll‑out of Abbott’s EnSite ® X EP System with Ensite Omnipolar Technology (OT), a new cardiac mapping platform available in the U.S., Japan and across Europe. In January 2022, Abbott announced FDA clearance for the EnSite ® X EP System with EnSite OT. The system leverages the Advisor ® HD Grid Catheter to provide a 360‑degree view of the heart without regard to the orientation of the catheter in the heart. Growth in Structural Heart during the first nine months of 2022, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was 12.8 percent, driven by growth across several areas of the business, including Amplatzer ®_ Amulet ® Left Atrial Appendage Occluder, which offers immediate closure of the left atrial appendage, an area in the heart where blood clots can form and MitraClip ® , Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, a leaky heart valve. In Vascular, sales during the first nine months of 2022, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, were virtually unchanged as higher endovascular sales were offset by the negative effect of lower average pricing for drug-eluting stents (DES) in the U.S. and a lag in the recovery of percutaneous coronary intervention case rates compared to many other cardiovascular procedures. In the first nine months of 2022, Medical Devices received various other product approvals. In February 2022, Abbott received FDA approval for an expanded indication for its CardioMEMS ® HF system, a small implantable sensor and remote monitoring system that can detect early warning signs of worsening heart failure. In April 2022, Abbott announced FDA approval for its Aveir ® single-chamber leadless pacemaker for the treatment of patients in the U.S. with slow heart rhythms. The gross profit margin percentage was 50.7 percent for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 54.8 percent for the third quarter of 2021. The decrease reflects the continued impact of the voluntary product recall and Sturgis manufacturing stoppage in the Nutritional business during the first half of 2022 as well as the prioritization of infant formula sales related to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The decrease also reflects higher manufacturing and supply chain costs across Abbott's businesses, including inflation, commodities and distribution expenses as well as lower COVID-19 testing-related sales in 2022 and the nonrecurrence of a favorable change in estimate in the third quarter of 2021 related to a previously recognized restructuring plan. The gross profit margin was 52.1 percent for the first nine months of 2022 compared to 51.6 percent for the first nine months of 2021. The increase reflects the nonrecurrence of 2021 restructuring charges and the impact of higher sales of COVID-19 rapid tests during the first nine months of 2022. These favorable impacts were partially offset by the impact of the voluntary product recall and Sturgis manufacturing stoppage in the Nutritional business as well as higher manufacturing and supply chain costs across Abbott's businesses, including inflation and higher commodity and distribution expenses. The future extent to which inflation, supply chain disruptions, and unfavorable foreign exchange rates will have a material effect on Abbott's operating results is uncertain. Research and development (R&D) expenses increased $110 million, or 16.2 percent, in the third quarter of 2022 and increased $183 million, or 9.2 percent, in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the prior year. The increase in the third quarter primarily reflects the impairment of certain in-process R&D intangible assets in the third quarter of 2022. The increase in the first nine months was also driven by higher spending on various projects to advance products in development partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. 25 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased $36 million, or 1.3 percent, in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year as higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses was more than offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. SG&A expenses were virtually unchanged in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the prior year as higher selling and marketing spending was offset by the nonrecurrence of certain 2021 litigation costs and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Other (Income) Expense, net Other income, net increased from $74 million of income in the third quarter of 2021 to $93 million of income in the third quarter of 2022 and from $214 million of income in the first nine months of 2021 to $253 million of income in the first nine months of 2022. The increases in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2022 were primarily due to higher income in 2022 related to the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs. In the first nine months of 2022, the higher year-to-date income related to the non-service cost components was partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a gain on the sale of an equity method investment that occurred in the second quarter of 2021. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net declined $37 million in the third quarter of 2022 and $61 million in the first nine months of 2022 versus 2021 due to the impact of higher interest rates and cash and short-term investment balances on interest income and the repayment of debt in the first quarter of 2022 partially offset by the impact of interest rate hedge contracts related to certain fixed-rate debt. Taxes on Earnings Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, taxes on earnings include approximately $36 million and $97 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first nine months of 2022, taxes on earnings also include approximately $20 million of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $75 million to $100 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. Liquidity and Capital Resources September 30, 2022 Compared with December 31, 2021 The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $9.8 billion at December 31, 2021 to $9.6 billion at September 30, 2022 primarily reflects share repurchases, the payment of dividends, capital expenditures, and the repayment of debt partially offset by the cash generated from operations in the first nine months of 2022. Working capital was $11.5 billion at September 30, 2022 and $11.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in working capital in 2022 primarily reflects an increase in inventory partially offset by an increase in the current portion of long-term debt and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months of 2022 totaled approximately $7.3 billion, a decrease of $211 million from the prior year primarily due to an increased investment in working capital partially offset by higher operating earnings. Net cash from operating activities includes $362 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $987 million in 2022. Net cash from operating activities includes $366 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $990 million in 2021. On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55% Notes upon maturity. In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. As of September 30, 2022, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion authorization remains available. At September 30, 2022, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A1 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2025. 26 Table of Contents In December 2021, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. The new authorization was in addition to the $1.081 billion portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2019 that was unused as of December 31, 2021. In the first nine months of 2022, Abbott repurchased 25.7 million of its common shares for $2.965 billion which fully utilized the authorization remaining under the 2019 share repurchase program and a portion of the 2021 authorization. As of September 30, 2022, $3.116 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2021 repurchase program. In each of the first three quarters of 2022, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of 4.4 percent over the $0.45 per share dividend declared in each of the first three quarters of 2021. Legislative Issues Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and are incorporated herein by reference. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. 27 Table of Contents PART I.

(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, there were no changes in Abbott’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Abbott’s internal control over financial reporting.

Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, approximately 16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. 10 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 2 — Revenue (Continued) Other Contract Assets and Liabilities Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: (in millions) Contract Liabilities: Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 520 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period 294 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ( 324 ) Balance at June 30, 2022 $ 490 Note 3 — Supplemental Financial Information Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 were $ 2.009 billion and $ 1.184 billion, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 were $ 4.447 billion and $ 2.969 billion, respectively. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first six months of 2022 includes $ 348 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 657 million. The first six months of 2021 includes $ 80 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 715 million. The following summarizes the activity for the first six months of 2022 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of June 30, 2022: (in millions) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 313 Provisions/charges to income 9 Amounts charged off and other deductions ( 34 ) Balance at June 30, 2022 $ 288 The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. 11 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 3 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) The components of long-term investments as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows: (in millions) June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Long-term Investments: Equity securities $ 620 $ 748 Other 114 68 Total $ 734 $ 816 The decrease in Abbott’s long-term investments as of June 30, 2022 versus the balance as of December 31, 2021 primarily relates to a decrease in the value of investments held in a rabbi trust and the impact of equity method investment losses partially offset by an investment in long-term time deposits. Abbott’s equity securities as of June 30, 2022, include $ 303 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. Abbott also holds certain investments as of June 30, 2022 with a carrying value of $ 227 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $ 82 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value.

Net actuarial losses and prior service cost are included as a component of net periodic benefit costs; see Note 11 for additional details. Note 5 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 22.7 billion at June 30, 2022 and $ 23.2 billion at December 31, 2021. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $ 486 million in the first six months of 2022. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at June 30, 2022 was $ 2.7 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.6 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.1 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first six months of 2022. The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $ 27.3 billion and $ 27.7 billion as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $ 16.6 billion and $ 15.9 billion as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $ 122 million in the first six months of 2022. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.1 billion in 2022, $ 2.0 billion in 2023, $ 1.9 billion in 2024, $ 1.7 billion in 2025 and $ 1.6 billion in 2026. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process R&D (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 919 million as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Note 6 — Restructuring Plans On May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $ 499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter included fixed asset write-downs of $ 80 million, inventory-related charges of $ 248 million, and other exit costs, which included contract cancellations and employee-related costs of $ 171 million. 13 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 6 — Restructuring Plans (Continued) In the second half of 2021, as the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 spread and the number of new COVID-19 cases increased significantly, particularly in the U.S., demand for rapid COVID-19 tests increased significantly. As a result, in the second half of 2021, Abbott sold approximately $ 181 million of inventory that was previously estimated to have no net realizable value under the second quarter of 2021 restructuring action. In addition, the estimate of other exit costs was reduced by a net $ 58 million as Abbott fulfilled its purchase obligations under certain contracts for which a liability was recorded in the second quarter of 2021 or Abbott settled with the counterparty in the second half of 2021. The following summarizes the activity related to this restructuring action and the status of the related accruals as of June 30, 2022: (in millions) Inventory- Related Charges Fixed Asset Write-Downs Other Exit Costs Total Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 $ 248 $ 80 $ 113 $ 441 Payments — — ( 90 ) ( 90 ) Other non-cash ( 248 ) ( 80 ) — ( 328 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2021 — — 23 23 Payments and other adjustments — — ( 10 ) ( 10 ) Accrued balance at June 30, 2022 $ — $ — $ 13 $ 13 In 2021, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in Abbott’s diagnostic, established pharmaceutical, nutritional, and medical device businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $ 68 million in 2021 of which approximately $ 16 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 4 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $ 48 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings: (in millions) Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 $ 68 Payments and other adjustments ( 7 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2021 61 Payments and other adjustments ( 30 ) Accrued balance at June 30, 2022 $ 31 Note 7 — Incentive Stock Programs In the first six months of 2022, Abbott granted 2,627,843 stock options, 514,205 restricted stock awards and 5,390,484 restricted stock units under its incentive stock program. At June 30, 2022, approximately 87 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2022 is as follows: Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 29,318,781 23,516,664 Weighted average remaining life (years) 5.6 4.8 Weighted average exercise price $ 69.99 $ 59.40 Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions) $ 1,199 $ 1,172 14 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 7 — Incentive Stock Programs (Continued) The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at June 30, 2022 amounted to approximately $ 713 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . Note 8 — Debt and Lines of Credit On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55 % Notes upon maturity. Note 9 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 8.4 billion at June 30, 2022 and $ 8.6 billion at December 31, 2021, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of June 30, 2022 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Abbott held the gross notional amounts of $ 11.3 billion and $ 12.2 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5 -year term loan of approximately $ 437 million and $ 521 million as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. 15 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 9 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021: Fair Value - Assets Fair Value - Liabilities (in millions) June 30, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021 Balance Sheet Caption June 30, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021 Balance Sheet Caption Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ — $ 87 Deferred income taxes and other assets $ 81 $ — Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: Hedging instruments 462 222 Prepaid expenses and other receivables 83 65 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges 101 70 Prepaid expenses and other receivables 89 32 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary — — n/a 437 521 Long-term debt $ 563 $ 379 $ 690 $ 618 The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.

The fair value of debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. Note 10 — Litigation and Environmental Matters Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. 18 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 10 — Litigation and Environmental Matters (Continued) Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 30 million to $ 45 million. The recorded accrual balance at June 30, 2022 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 40 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Note 11 — Post-Employment Benefits Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized for the three and six months ended June 30 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: Defined Benefit Plans Medical and Dental Plans Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Service cost - benefits earned during the period $ 94 $ 96 $ 190 $ 196 $ 12 $ 14 $ 25 $ 28 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations 75 62 151 124 8 9 18 17 Expected return on plan assets ( 234 ) ( 211 ) ( 470 ) ( 422 ) ( 8 ) ( 7 ) ( 15 ) ( 14 ) Net amortization of: Actuarial loss, net 57 78 116 159 1 7 6 14 Prior service cost (credit) 1 1 1 1 ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 12 ) ( 14 ) Net cost (credit) $ ( 7 ) $ 26 $ ( 12 ) $ 58 $ 7 $ 16 $ 22 $ 31 Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to Internal Revenue Service funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first six months of 2022 and 2021, $ 348 million and $ 80 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans. In the first six months of 2022, $ 28 million was contributed to the post-employment medical and dental plans. No contributions were made to the post-employment medical and dental plans in the first six months of 2021. Note 12 — Taxes on Earnings Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first six months of 2022 and 2021, taxes on earnings include approximately $ 32 million and $ 90 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first six months of 2022, taxes on earnings also include approximately $ 27 million of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $ 90 million to $ 115 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. 19 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Note 13 — Segment Information Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Review — Results of Operations Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The following tables detail sales by reportable segment for the three and six months ended June 30. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers.

Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $2.3 billion during the second quarter of 2022 and approximately $1.3 billion during the second quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales decreased 0.3 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 4.1 percent. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the second quarter as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 6.5 percent and total sales by 4.2 percent. The 15.9 percent increase in total net sales during the first six months of 2022, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflected demand for Abbott’s rapid diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19 as well as growth in the Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceutical Products segments partially offset by lower Nutritional Products sales. Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $5.6 billion during the first six months of 2022 and approximately $3.5 billion during the first six months of 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 1.7 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 5.9 percent. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first six months as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 6.2 percent and total sales by 3.9 percent. Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the future extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. The table below provides detail by sales category for the six months ended June 30. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers.

Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased by 9.2 percent in the first six months of 2022. International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 5.6 percent in the first six months of 2022 versus the comparable 2021 period and the decrease reflects lower sales due to challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China partially offset by higher volumes sold in various countries in Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased 11.5 percent, reflecting double digit growth of the Ensure ® and Glucerna ® brands in several countries in Southeast Asia and China. In the first six months of 2022, U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 2.1 percent. In U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals, Abbott initiated a voluntary recall in February 2022 of certain infant powder formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan and stopped production at the facility. The 27.5 percent decrease in U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales in the first six months of 2022 reflects the impact of the recall and production stoppage partially offset by increased demand for Abbott’s Pedialyte ® products. U.S. sales of certain infant powder formulas associated with the recall were $175 million in the first six months of 2022 and $568 million in the first six months of 2021. On May 16, 2022, Abbott entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the steps necessary to resume production and maintain the Sturgis facility and operations. On July 1, Abbott restarted partial production at the facility starting with its specialty formula EleCare ® and metabolic formulas. Subsequently, Abbott restarted Similac ® production. The consent decree does not affect any other Abbott plant or operation. Abbott has taken various actions to mitigate the impact of the recall on the supply of formula in the U.S. These actions have included the shipment of infant formula powder into the U.S. from Abbott's FDA-registered facility in Ireland, prioritization of infant formula production at its Columbus, Ohio facility, conversion of other liquid manufacturing lines into manufacturing Similac liquid ready-to-feed product, and increased production of powder infant formula at its Casa Grande, Arizona manufacturing site. The 35.9 percent increase in Diagnostic Products sales in the first six months of 2022, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was driven by demand for Abbott’s portfolio of COVID-19 tests in Rapid Diagnostics and growth in routine diagnostic testing in Molecular Diagnostics. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, sales increased 1.3 percent in the first six months of 2022, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the higher volume of routine diagnostic testing from the continued roll-out of the Alinity ® platform and an expanded menu of tests. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Abbott’s laboratory-based tests for the detection of COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibodies, which determine if someone was previously infected with the COVID-19 virus, as well as market disruptions in China due to COVID-19 quarantine restrictions in various cities during the second quarter of 2022. In the first six months of 2022 and 2021, Core Laboratory Diagnostics IgG and IgM antibody testing-related sales on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were $40 million and $112 million, respectively. In the first six months of 2022, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales decreased 0.5 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 4.3 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. The 11.3 percent decrease in Molecular Diagnostics sales in the first six months of 2022, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by lower demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 partially offset by growth in the base business from increased routine molecular testing and an expanded menu of tests . In the first six months of 2022 and 2021, Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $321 million and $480 million, respectively. In the first six months of 2022, Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 21.7 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 26.0 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 70.4 percent in the first six months of 2022, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the demand for Abbott’s COVID-19 tests on its rapid testing platforms, including the Panbio ® system, the ID NOW ® platform, and the BinaxNOW ® COVID-19 Ag Card test. In the first six months of 2022 and 2021, Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $5.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. In the first six months of 2022, Rapid Diagnostics sales increased 14.0 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 16.1 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. These increases reflect higher sales of ID NOW tests for flu, strep, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as well as growth in various other Rapid Diagnostics products. 24 Table of Contents Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 9.4 percent in the first six months of 2022, driven by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Heart Failure. Growth in Diabetes Care sales was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, in the U.S. and internationally. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $2.1 billion in the first six months of 2022, which reflected a 25.9 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over the first six months of 2021 when FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $1.7 billion. In May 2022, Abbott announced FDA clearance of its Freestyle Libre 3 system, which automatically delivers up-to-the-minute glucose readings and 14-day accuracy in the world's smallest and thinnest wearable sensor. During the first six months of 2022, procedure volumes across Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were negatively impacted by elevated COVID-19 case rates early in 2022 as well as new surges of COVID-19 in several geographies, healthcare staffing challenges, and quarantine restrictions in China during the second quarter. Despite such challenges, overall volume trends improved in several businesses versus the first six months of 2021. In Electrophysiology, the 10.5 percent growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects the increase in procedure volumes and the U.S. roll‑out of Abbott’s EnSite™ X EP System with Ensite Omnipolar Technology (OT), a new cardiac mapping platform available in the U.S., Japan and across Europe. In January 2022, Abbott announced FDA clearance for the EnSite X EP System with EnSite OT. The system leverages the Advisor™ HD Grid Catheter to provide a 360‑degree view of the heart without regard to the orientation of the catheter in the heart. Growth in Structural Heart during the first six months of 2022, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was 11.7 percent, driven by growth across several areas of the business, including Amplatzer ® Amulet ® Left Atrial Appendage Occluder, which offers immediate closure of the left atrial appendage, an area in the heart where blood clots can form and MitraClip ® , Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, a leaky heart valve. In Vascular, the 0.4 percent decrease in sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, during the first six months of 2022 reflects the negative effect of lower average pricing for drug-eluting stents (DES) in the U.S. and a lag in the recovery of percutaneous coronary intervention case rates compared to many other cardiovascular procedures partially offset by higher endovascular sales. In the first six months of 2022, Medical Devices received various other product approvals. In February 2022, Abbott received FDA approval for an expanded indication for its CardioMEMS™ HF system, a small implantable sensor and remote monitoring system that can detect early warning signs of worsening heart failure. In April 2022, Abbott announced FDA approval for its Aveir™ single-chamber leadless pacemaker for the treatment of patients in the U.S. with slow heart rhythms. The gross profit margin percentage was 51.7 percent for the second quarter of 2022 compared to 46.7 percent for the second quarter of 2021 and 52.8 percent for the first six months of 2022 compared to 49.9 percent for the first six months of 2021. The increases in the quarter and the first six months of 2022 reflect the nonrecurrence of $499 million of 2021 restructuring charges. The increases in the quarter and the first six months of 2022 also reflect higher sales volume of COVID-19 rapid tests and various other products, the impact of gross margin improvement initiatives, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange on costs. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the voluntary product recall in the Nutritional business, higher manufacturing and supply chain costs, including inflation, commodities and distribution expenses, and lower COVID-19 testing-related sales in Core Laboratory and Molecular Diagnostics . Research and development (R&D) expenses increased $30 million, or 4.8 percent, in the second quarter of 2022 and increased $73 million, or 5.6 percent, in the first six months of 2022 compared to the prior year. The increases in R&D expenses in the second quarter and the first six months of 2022 were primarily driven by higher spending on various projects to advance products in development partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $31 million, or 1.1 percent, in the second quarter of 2022, and increased $35 million, or 0.6 percent, in the first six months of 2022, due primarily to higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses partially offset by the nonrecurrence of certain 2021 litigation costs and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Other (Income) Expense, net Other income, net increased from $79 million of income in the second quarter of 2021 to $82 million of income in the second quarter of 2022 and from $140 million of income in the first six months of 2021 to $160 million of income in the first six months of 2022. The increases in the second quarter and the first six months of 2022 were primarily due to higher income in 2022 related to the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs 25 Table of Contents partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a gain on the sale of an equity method investment that occurred in the second quarter of 2021. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net declined $17 million in the second quarter of 2022 and $24 million in the first six months of 2022 versus 2021 due to the impact of higher interest rates and cash and short-term investment balances on interest income and the repayment of debt in the first quarter of 2022. Taxes on Earnings Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first six months of 2022 and 2021, taxes on earnings include approximately $32 million and $90 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first six months of 2022, taxes on earnings also include approximately $27 million of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $90 million to $115 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. Liquidity and Capital Resources June 30, 2022 Compared with December 31, 2021 The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $9.8 billion at December 31, 2021 to $8.9 billion at June 30, 2022 primarily reflects share repurchases, the payment of dividends, the repayment of debt and capital expenditures partially offset by the cash generated from operations in the first six months of 2022. Working capital was $12.6 billion at June 30, 2022 and $11.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in working capital in 2022 primarily reflects increases in accounts receivable and inventory and a decrease in the current portion of long-term debt partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2022 totaled approximately $4.5 billion, a decrease of $290 million from the prior year primarily due to an increased investment in working capital and the timing of pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions partially offset by higher operating earnings and a reduction in cash taxes paid. Net cash from operating activities includes $348 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $657 million in 2022. Net cash from operating activities includes $80 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $715 million in 2021. On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55% Notes upon maturity. In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. As of June 30, 2022, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion authorization remains available. At June 30, 2022, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A1 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2025. In December 2021, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. The new authorization was in addition to the $1.081 billion portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2019 that was unused as of December 31, 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, Abbott repurchased 17.3 million of its common shares for $2.1 billion which fully utilized the authorization remaining under the 2019 share repurchase program and a portion of the 2021 authorization. As of June 30, 2022, $3.981 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2021 repurchase program. In each of the first two quarters of 2022, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of 4.4 percent over the $0.45 per share dividend declared in each of the first two quarters of 2021. 26 Table of Contents Legislative Issues Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and are incorporated herein by reference.

However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. ​ ​ Note 2 — Revenue ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. ​ The following table provides detail by sales category: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 ​ Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 902 ​ $ 902 ​ $ — ​ $ 821 ​ $ 821 Other ​ — ​ 245 ​ 245 ​ — ​ 249 ​ ​ 249 Total ​ — ​ 1,147 ​ 1,147 ​ — ​ 1,070 ​ ​ 1,070 Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 338 ​ 509 ​ 847 ​ 508 ​ 558 ​ 1,066 Adult Nutritionals ​ 339 ​ 708 ​ 1,047 ​ 328 ​ 642 ​ 970 Total ​ 677 ​ 1,217 ​ 1,894 ​ 836 ​ 1,200 ​ 2,036 Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 268 ​ 916 ​ 1,184 ​ 271 ​ 911 ​ 1,182 Molecular ​ 172 ​ 248 ​ 420 ​ 175 ​ 272 ​ 447 Point of Care ​ 91 ​ 37 ​ 128 ​ 92 ​ 37 ​ 129 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 2,210 ​ 1,344 ​ 3,554 ​ 1,103 ​ 1,153 ​ 2,256 Total ​ 2,741 ​ 2,545 ​ 5,286 ​ 1,641 ​ 2,373 ​ 4,014 Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 248 ​ 276 ​ 524 ​ 241 ​ 278 ​ 519 Electrophysiology ​ 216 ​ 269 ​ 485 ​ 179 ​ 252 ​ 431 Heart Failure ​ 167 ​ 54 ​ 221 ​ 145 ​ 49 ​ 194 Vascular ​ 209 ​ 410 ​ 619 ​ 219 ​ 416 ​ 635 Structural Heart ​ 190 ​ 221 ​ 411 ​ 169 ​ 208 ​ 377 Neuromodulation ​ 143 ​ 36 ​ 179 ​ 145 ​ 39 ​ 184 Diabetes Care ​ ​ 343 ​ ​ 783 ​ ​ 1,126 ​ ​ 253 ​ ​ 727 ​ ​ 980 Total ​ 1,516 ​ 2,049 ​ 3,565 ​ 1,351 ​ 1,969 ​ 3,320 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 3 ​ — ​ 3 ​ 10 ​ 6 ​ 16 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ $ 4,937 ​ $ 6,958 ​ $ 11,895 ​ $ 3,838 ​ $ 6,618 ​ $ 10,456 ​ 8 Table of Contents Note 2 — Revenue (Continued) ​ Remaining Performance Obligations ​ As of March 31, 2022, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 3.8 billion in the Diagnostics segment and approximately $ 428 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months , approximately 16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. ​ These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. ​ Other Contract Assets and Liabilities ​ Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. ​ Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. ​ Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Contract Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2021 ​ $ 520 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ ​ 171 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ​ ( 178 ) Balance at March 31, 2022 ​ $ 513 ​ ​ Note 3 — Supplemental Financial Information ​ Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 were $ 2.438 billion and $ 1.785 billion, respectively. ​ Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first three months of 2022 includes $ 334 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 195 million. The first three months of 2021 includes $ 16 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 270 million. ​ 9 Table of Contents Note 3 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) ​ The following summarizes the activity for the first three months of 2022 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2021 ​ $ 313 Provisions/charges to income ​ ​ 3 Amounts charged off and other deductions ​ ( 15 ) Balance at March 31, 2022 ​ $ 301 ​ The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. ​ The components of long-term investments as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ March 31, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Long-term Investments: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 703 ​ $ 748 Other ​ 60 ​ 68 Total ​ $ 763 ​ $ 816 ​ The decrease in Abbott’s long-term investments as of March 31, 2022 versus the balance as of December 31, 2021 primarily relates to a decrease in the value of investments held in a rabbi trust. ​ Abbott’s equity securities as of March 31, 2022, include $ 357 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. ​ Abbott also holds certain investments as of March 31, 2022 with a carrying value of $ 244 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of $ 92 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. ​ 10 Table of Contents Note 4 — Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ​ The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended March 31 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains (Losses) ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ Net Actuarial (Losses) and ​ on Derivative Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Prior Service (Costs) and ​ Designated as Cash Flow ​ ​ Adjustments ​ Credits ​ Hedges (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Balance at January 1 ​ $ ( 5,839 ) ​ $ ( 4,859 ) ​ $ ( 2,670 ) ​ $ ( 3,871 ) ​ $ 135 ​ $ ( 216 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ( 106 ) ​ ( 536 ) ​ ​ 17 ​ 22 ​ ( 34 ) ​ 96 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ — ​ 45 ​ 63 ​ ( 22 ) ​ 16 Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ ( 106 ) ​ ( 536 ) ​ 62 ​ 85 ​ ( 56 ) ​ 112 Balance at March 31 ​ $ ( 5,945 ) ​ $ ( 5,395 ) ​ $ ( 2,608 ) ​ $ ( 3,786 ) ​ $ 79 ​ $ ( 104 ) ​ (Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges are recorded as Cost of products sold. Net actuarial losses and prior service cost are included as a component of net periodic benefit costs; see Note 11 for additional details. ​ Note 5 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets ​ The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 23.2 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $ 50 million in the first three months of 2022. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at March 31, 2022 was $ 2.8 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.7 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.4 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first three months of 2022. ​ The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $ 27.7 billion as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and accumulated amortization was $ 16.4 billion as of March 31, 2022 and $ 15.9 billion as of December 31, 2021. Foreign currency translation adjustments increased intangible assets by $ 3 million in the first three months of 2022. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.1 billion in 2022, $ 2.0 billion in 2023, $ 1.9 billion in 2024, $ 1.7 billion in 2025 and $ 1.6 billion in 2026. ​ Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process R&D (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 919 million as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. ​ 11 Table of Contents Note 6 — Restructuring Plans ​ On May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $ 499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter included fixed asset write-downs of $ 80 million, inventory-related charges of $ 248 million, and other exit costs, which included contract cancellations and employee-related costs of $ 171 million. ​ In the second half of 2021, as the Delta and Omicron variants of COVID-19 spread and the number of new COVID-19 cases increased significantly, particularly in the U.S., demand for rapid COVID-19 tests increased significantly. As a result, in the second half of 2021, Abbott sold approximately $ 181 million of inventory that was previously estimated to have no net realizable value under the second quarter of 2021 restructuring action. In addition, the estimate of other exit costs was reduced by a net $ 58 million as Abbott fulfilled its purchase obligations under certain contracts for which a liability was recorded in the second quarter or Abbott settled with the counterparty in the second half of 2021. The following summarizes the activity related to this restructuring action and the status of the related accruals as of March 31, 2022: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Inventory- ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Related ​ Fixed Asset ​ Other Exit ​ ​ ​ (in millions) Charges Write-Downs Costs Total Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 ​ $ 248 ​ $ 80 ​ $ 113 ​ $ 441 Payments ​ — ​ — ​ ( 90 ) ​ ( 90 ) Other non-cash ​ ( 248 ) ​ ( 80 ) ​ — ​ ( 328 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2021 ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 23 ​ ​ 23 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ ( 3 ) ​ ​ ( 3 ) Accrued balance at March 31, 2022 ​ $ — ​ $ — ​ $ 20 ​ $ 20 ​ In 2021, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in Abbott’s diagnostics, established pharmaceuticals, nutritional, and medical devices businesses. Abbott recorded employee-related severance and other charges of approximately $ 68 million in 2021 of which approximately $ 16 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, approximately $ 4 million was recorded in Research and development, and approximately $ 48 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense. ​ The following summarizes the activity for these restructurings: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Restructuring charges ​ $ 68 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 7 ) Accrued balance at December 31, 2021 ​ ​ 61 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 16 ) Accrued balance at March 31, 2022 ​ $ 45 ​ ​ 12 Table of Contents Note 7 — Incentive Stock Programs ​ In the first three months of 2022, Abbott granted 2,594,059 stock options, 514,148 restricted stock awards and 5,303,072 restricted stock units under its incentive stock program. At March 31, 2022, approximately 86 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at March 31, 2022 is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 29,479,237 ​ 23,547,781 Weighted average remaining life ( years ) 5.9 ​ 5.1 Weighted average exercise price $ 69.87 ​ $ 59.23 Aggregate intrinsic value ( in millions ) $ 1,445 ​ $ 1,397 ​ The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at March 31, 2022 amounted to approximately $ 825 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . ​ Note 8 — Debt and Lines of Credit ​ On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55 % Notes due 2022 upon maturity. ​ Note 9 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures ​ Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 8.5 billion at March 31, 2022 and $ 8.6 billion at December 31, 2021 are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of March 31, 2022 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . ​ Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Abbott held the gross notional amount of $ 12.2 billion of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. ​ Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $ 491 million and $ 521 million as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. ​ Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. ​ 13 Table of Contents Note 9 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) ​ The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value - Assets ​ Fair Value - Liabilities ​ ​ March 31, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ ​ March 31, ​ Dec. 31, ​ (in millions) 2022 2021 Balance Sheet Caption 2022 2021 Balance Sheet Caption Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ $ — $ 87 Deferred income taxes and other assets $ 34 $ — Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Hedging instruments ​ 204 ​ 222 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 183 ​ 65 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges ​ 149 ​ 70 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 93 ​ 32 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ n/a ​ ​ 491 ​ ​ 521 ​ Long-term debt ​ ​ $ 353 $ 379 ​ ​ $ 801 $ 618 ​ ​ ​ The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gain (loss) Recognized in ​ Income (expense) and ​ ​ ​ ​ Other Comprehensive ​ Gain (loss) Reclassified ​ ​ ​ ​ Income (loss) ​ into Income ​ ​ (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Income Statement Caption Foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges ​ $ ( 49 ) ​ $ 134 ​ $ 27 ​ $ ( 23 ) ​ Cost of products sold Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ 30 ​ 35 ​ — ​ — n/a Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ ( 121 ) ​ ( 69 ) Interest expense ​ Losses of $ 51 million and gains of $ 49 million were recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as a hedge.

The fair value of debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. ​ Note 10 — Litigation and Environmental Matters ​ Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. ​ Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 30 million to $ 45 million. The recorded accrual balance at March 31, 2022 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 40 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ​ Note 11 — Post-Employment Benefits ​ Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized for the three months ended March 31 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined Benefit Plans ​ Medical and Dental Plans ​ ​ March 31, ​ March 31, ​ March 31, ​ March 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Service cost — benefits earned during the period ​ $ 96 ​ $ 100 ​ $ 13 ​ $ 14 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations ​ 76 ​ 62 ​ 10 ​ 8 Expected return on plan assets ​ ( 236 ) ​ ( 211 ) ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 7 ) Net amortization of: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Actuarial loss, net ​ 59 ​ 81 ​ 5 ​ 7 Prior service cost (credit) ​ — ​ — ​ ( 6 ) ​ ( 7 ) Net cost (credit) ​ $ ( 5 ) ​ $ 32 ​ $ 15 ​ $ 15 ​ Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to Internal Revenue Service funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first three months of 2022 and 2021, $ 334 million and $ 16 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans. Contributions made to post-employment medical and dental plans in the first three months of 2022 were $ 28 million. No contributions were made to the post-employment medical and dental plans in the first three months of 2021. ​ 16 Table of Contents Note 12 — Taxes on Earnings ​ Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2022 and 2021, taxes on earnings include approximately $ 30 million and $ 80 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first three months of 2022, taxes on earnings also include approximately $ 30 million of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $ 70 million to $ 80 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. ​ Note 13 — Segment Information ​ Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world. ​ Abbott’s reportable segments are as follows: ​ Established Pharmaceutical Products — International sales of a broad line of branded generic pharmaceutical products. ​ Nutritional Products — Worldwide sales of a broad line of adult and pediatric nutritional products. ​ Diagnostic Products — Worldwide sales of diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, physicians’ offices and alternate-care testing sites. For segment reporting purposes, the Core Laboratory Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics divisions are aggregated and reported as the Diagnostic Products segment. ​ Medical Devices — Worldwide sales of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care products. For segment reporting purposes, the Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Vascular, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care divisions are aggregated and reported as the Medical Devices segment. ​ Abbott’s underlying accounting records are maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting requirements. Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment’s assets. ​ 17 Table of Contents Note 13 — Segment Information (Continued) ​ The following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended March 31 ​ ​ Net Sales to ​ Operating ​ ​ External Customers ​ Earnings (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Established Pharmaceutical Products ​ $ 1,147 ​ $ 1,070 ​ $ 242 ​ $ 169 Nutritional Products ​ 1,894 ​ 2,036 ​ 251 ​ 467 Diagnostic Products ​ 5,286 ​ 4,014 ​ 2,569 ​ 1,701 Medical Devices ​ 3,565 ​ 3,320 ​ 1,078 ​ 1,007 Total Reportable Segments ​ 11,892 ​ 10,440 ​ 4,140 ​ 3,344 Other ​ 3 ​ 16 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net sales ​ $ 11,895 ​ $ 10,456 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Corporate functions and benefit plans costs ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 114 ) ​ ​ ( 114 ) Net interest expense ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 117 ) ​ ​ ( 124 ) Share-based compensation (a) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 305 ) ​ ​ ( 288 ) Amortization of intangible assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 512 ) ​ ​ ( 509 ) Other, net (b) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 216 ) ​ ​ ( 266 ) Earnings before taxes ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 2,876 ​ $ 2,043 ​ ​ ​ 18 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ​ Financial Review - Results of Operations ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. ​ The following table details sales by reportable segment for the three months ended March 31. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Sales to External Customers ​ Three Months Three Months ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Ended ​ Ended ​ ​ ​ Impact of ​ Total Change ​ ​ March 31, ​ March 31, ​ Total ​ Foreign ​ Excl.

During the first quarter of 2022, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $3.3 billion led by combined sales of approximately $3.0 billion related to Abbott’s BinaxNOW ® , Panbio ® , and ID NOW ® rapid testing platforms. During the first quarter of 2021, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $2.2 billion led by combined sales of approximately $1.8 billion related to Abbott’s BinaxNOW, Panbio, and ID NOW rapid testing platforms. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 3.9 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 7.7 percent. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first quarter as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 6.0 percent and total sales by 3.7 percent. ​ Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the future extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. ​ 19 Table of Contents The table below provides detail by sales category for the three months ended March 31.

Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased by 1.2 percent. ​ International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 5.4 percent. The decrease reflects lower sales due to challenging market dynamics in the infant category in Greater China partially offset by higher volumes sold in various countries in Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased 15.6 percent, and U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 3.7 percent, reflecting continued growth of the Ensure ® and Glucerna ® brands in several countries including the U.S. ​ In U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals, Abbott initiated a voluntary recall in February 2022 of certain infant powder formula products manufactured at one of its U.S. facilities and stopped production at the facility. The 33.6 percent decrease in U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales reflects the impact of the recall and production stoppage partially offset by increased demand for Abbott’s Pedialyte ® and PediaSure ® products. U.S. sales of certain infant powder formulas were $59 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $288 million in the first quarter of 2021. Abbott is working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on corrective actions and enhancements so that operations at the facility can be restarted. Abbott cannot predict when manufacturing at the facility will restart. Abbott is also working to bring infant powder formula to the U.S. from its FDA-regulated facility in Europe and to increase production at other U.S. manufacturing plants. ​ 20 Table of Contents The 35.1 percent increase in Diagnostic Products sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was driven by demand for Abbott’s portfolio of COVID-19 tests in Rapid Diagnostics and growth in routine diagnostic testing in Core Laboratory Diagnostics and Molecular Diagnostics. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, sales increased 4.2 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the higher volume of routine diagnostic testing from the continued roll-out of the Alinity ® platform and an expanded menu of tests partially offset by lower sales of Abbott’s laboratory-based tests for the detection of COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibodies, which determine if someone was previously infected with the COVID-19 virus. In the first three months of 2022 and 2021, Core Laboratory Diagnostics COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibody testing-related sales on Abbott’s ARCHITECT ® and Alinity i platforms were $28 million and $54 million, respectively. In the first three months of 2022, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 2.4 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 6.6 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. ​ The 3.0 percent decrease in Molecular Diagnostics sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by lower demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 on its m2000 ® platform partially offset by growth in the base business from increased routine molecular testing and an expanded menu of tests. In the first three months of 2022 and 2021, Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $246 million and $307 million, respectively. In the first three months of 2022, Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 24.8 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 29.0 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. ​ In Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 60.8 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the demand for Abbott’s COVID-19 tests on its rapid testing platforms, including the Panbio system, the ID NOW platform, and the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test. In the first three months of 2022 and 2021, Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were approximately $3.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. In the first three months of 2022, Rapid Diagnostics sales increased 21.6 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 23.5 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. These increases reflect higher sales of ID NOW tests for flu, strep, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as well as growth in other Rapid Diagnostics products. ​ Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 11.5 percent driven by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Heart Failure. Growth in Diabetes Care sales was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, internationally and in the U.S. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $995 million in the first three months of 2022, which reflected a 26.2 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over the first three months of 2021 when FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $827 million. ​ While procedure volumes across Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were negatively impacted by elevated COVID-19 case rates early in 2022, overall volume trends improved as case rates declined in the second half of the first quarter. In Electrophysiology, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, the increase in procedure volumes also reflects the U.S. roll-out of Abbott’s EnSite™ X EP System with Ensite Omnipolar Technology (OT), a new cardiac mapping platform available in the U.S., Japan and across Europe. In January 2022, Abbott announced FDA clearance for the EnSite X EP System with EnSite OT. The system leverages the Advisor™ HD Grid Catheter to provide a 360-degree view of the heart without regard to the orientation of the catheter in the heart. ​ Growth in Structural Heart, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was broad-based across several areas of the business, including Amplatzer ® Amulet ® Left Atrial Appendage Occluder, which offers immediate closure of the left atrial appendage, an area in the heart where blood clots can form and MitraClip ® , Abbott’s market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation, a leaky heart valve. In Vascular, the 1.0 percent growth in sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflects higher endovascular sales partially offset by the negative effect of lower average pricing for drug-eluting stents (DES) in the U.S. and a lag in the recovery of percutaneous coronary intervention case rates compared to many other cardiovascular procedures. ​ In 2022, Medical Devices received various product approvals. In February 2022, Abbott received FDA approval for an expanded indication for its CardioMEMS™ HF system, a small implantable sensor and remote monitoring system that can detect early warning signs of worsening heart failure. In April 2022, Abbott announced FDA approval for its Aveir™ single-chamber leadless pacemaker for the treatment of patients in the U.S. with slow heart rhythms. ​ The gross profit margin percentage was 53.8 percent for the first quarter of 2022 compared to 53.0 percent for the first quarter of 2021. The increase in the quarter reflects the effect of higher sales volume of COVID-19 rapid tests, the impact of gross margin improvement initiatives, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange on costs partially offset by the impact of the voluntary product recall in the Nutritional business and higher inflation on various manufacturing inputs, commodities and distribution costs. ​ 21 Table of Contents Research and development (R&D) expenses increased $43 million, or 6.5 percent, in the first quarter of 2022. The 2022 increase in R&D was primarily driven by higher spending on various projects to advance products in development partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. ​ Selling, general and administrative expenses were basically flat in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021. Higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses was offset by the nonrecurrence of certain 2021 litigation costs and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. ​ Other (Income) Expense, net ​ Other income, net increased from $61 million of income in the first quarter of 2021 to $78 million of income in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in the first quarter was primarily due to higher income in 2022 related to the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs partially offset by the change in earnings of equity method investments. ​ Interest Expense, net ​ Interest expense, net decreased $7 million in the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on interest income in the first quarter of 2022 and the repayment of debt in the first quarter of 2022. ​ Taxes on Earnings ​ Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2022 and 2021, taxes on earnings include approximately $30 million and $80 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first three months of 2022, taxes on earnings also include approximately $30 million of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $70 million to $80 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources March 31, 2022 Compared with December 31, 2021 ​ Cash and cash equivalents decreased from $9.8 billion at December 31, 2021 to $7.7 billion at March 31, 2022 as cash used to fund share repurchases, the payment of dividends, the repayment of debt and capital expenditures was partially offset by cash generated from operations in the first three months of 2022. Working capital declined from $11.1 billion at December 31, 2021 to $10.8 billion at March 31, 2022 as the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and the increase in accounts payable were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory. ​ In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first three months of 2022 totaled $2.1 billion, a decrease of $572 million compared to the prior year primarily due to an increased investment in various working capital components and the timing of pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions partially offset by higher operating earnings and a reduction in cash taxes paid. Cash taxes paid in the first three months of 2022 totaled approximately $195 million versus $270 million in 2021. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities was a use of $205 million for the first three months of 2022 and a use of $6 million for the first three months of 2021. The year-over-year change in Other, net in Net cash from operating activities primarily reflects the timing of benefit plan contributions. ​ On March 15, 2022, Abbott repaid the $750 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.55% Notes due 2022 upon maturity. ​ In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. As of March 31, 2022, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion authorization remains available. ​ At March 31, 2022, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A1 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5 billion which expire in 2025. ​ 22 Table of Contents In December 2021, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. The new authorization was in addition to the $1.081 billion portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2019 that was unused as of December 31, 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, Abbott repurchased 17.3 million of its common shares for $2.1 billion which fully utilized the authorization remaining under the 2019 share repurchase program and a portion of the 2021 authorization. As of March 31, 2022, $3.981 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2021 repurchase program. ​ In the first quarter of 2022, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of 4.4 percent over the $0.45 per share dividend declared in the first quarter of 2021. ​ Legislative Issues ​ Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​ Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements ​ Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and are incorporated herein by reference. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. ​ 23 Table of Contents PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures ​ ​ ​ PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ​ Item 1. Legal Proceedings ​ Abbott is involved in various claims, legal proceedings and investigations as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, including (as of March 31, 2022, except where noted below) those described below. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ​ In its 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Abbott reported that it is a defendant in numerous lawsuits in federal and state courts involving certain of its specialty infant formula products administered to preterm infants. In April 2022, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered the consolidation of the federal court cases in the Northern District of Illinois for pretrial purposes. ​ 24 Table of Contents Item 2.

Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 1 — Basis of Presentation ​ The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. ​ Note 2 — New Accounting Standards ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ Note 3 — Revenue ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. ​ 9 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) ​ Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) ​ The following tables provide detail by sales category: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 ​ Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 936 ​ $ 936 ​ $ — ​ $ 799 ​ $ 799 Other ​ — ​ 329 ​ 329 ​ — ​ 300 ​ ​ 300 Total ​ — ​ 1,265 ​ 1,265 ​ — ​ 1,099 ​ 1,099 Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 586 ​ 514 ​ 1,100 ​ 488 ​ 518 ​ 1,006 Adult Nutritionals ​ 333 ​ 675 ​ 1,008 ​ 330 ​ 588 ​ 918 Total ​ 919 ​ 1,189 ​ 2,108 ​ 818 ​ 1,106 ​ 1,924 Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 291 ​ 1,001 ​ 1,292 ​ 284 ​ 892 ​ 1,176 Molecular ​ 162 ​ 183 ​ 345 ​ 220 ​ 238 ​ 458 Point of Care ​ 100 ​ 35 ​ 135 ​ 96 ​ 35 ​ 131 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 1,394 ​ 746 ​ 2,140 ​ 533 ​ 342 ​ 875 Total ​ 1,947 ​ 1,965 ​ 3,912 ​ 1,133 ​ 1,507 ​ 2,640 Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 266 ​ 305 ​ 571 ​ 242 ​ 265 ​ 507 Electrophysiology ​ 192 ​ 293 ​ 485 ​ 192 ​ 249 ​ 441 Heart Failure ​ 170 ​ 59 ​ 229 ​ 144 ​ 46 ​ 190 Vascular ​ 219 ​ 425 ​ 644 ​ 230 ​ 400 ​ 630 Structural Heart ​ 177 ​ 215 ​ 392 ​ 159 ​ 194 ​ 353 Neuromodulation ​ 149 ​ 41 ​ 190 ​ 170 ​ 36 ​ 206 Diabetes Care ​ ​ 323 ​ ​ 798 ​ ​ 1,121 ​ ​ 226 ​ ​ 617 ​ ​ 843 Total ​ 1,496 ​ 2,136 ​ 3,632 ​ 1,363 ​ 1,807 ​ 3,170 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 6 ​ 5 ​ 11 ​ 15 ​ 5 ​ 20 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ $ 4,368 ​ $ 6,560 ​ $ 10,928 ​ $ 3,329 ​ $ 5,524 ​ $ 8,853 ​ ​ 10 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) ​ Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 ​ Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 2,672 ​ $ 2,672 ​ $ — ​ $ 2,376 ​ $ 2,376 Other ​ — ​ 843 ​ 843 ​ — ​ 780 ​ ​ 780 Total ​ — ​ 3,515 ​ 3,515 ​ — ​ 3,156 ​ 3,156 Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 1,622 ​ 1,637 ​ 3,259 ​ 1,490 ​ 1,629 ​ 3,119 Adult Nutritionals ​ 1,006 ​ 1,987 ​ 2,993 ​ 948 ​ 1,644 ​ 2,592 Total ​ 2,628 ​ 3,624 ​ 6,252 ​ 2,438 ​ 3,273 ​ 5,711 Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 845 ​ 2,935 ​ 3,780 ​ 840 ​ 2,312 ​ 3,152 Molecular ​ 431 ​ 651 ​ 1,082 ​ 429 ​ 527 ​ 956 Point of Care ​ 289 ​ 112 ​ 401 ​ 278 ​ 109 ​ 387 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 3,178 ​ 2,732 ​ 5,910 ​ 1,246 ​ 719 ​ 1,965 Total ​ 4,743 ​ 6,430 ​ 11,173 ​ 2,793 ​ 3,667 ​ 6,460 Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 776 ​ 881 ​ 1,657 ​ 655 ​ 727 ​ 1,382 Electrophysiology ​ 580 ​ 823 ​ 1,403 ​ 476 ​ 652 ​ 1,128 Heart Failure ​ 483 ​ 167 ​ 650 ​ 411 ​ 140 ​ 551 Vascular ​ 684 ​ 1,292 ​ 1,976 ​ 628 ​ 1,108 ​ 1,736 Structural Heart ​ 537 ​ 654 ​ 1,191 ​ 386 ​ 508 ​ 894 Neuromodulation ​ 460 ​ 124 ​ 584 ​ 392 ​ 97 ​ 489 Diabetes Care ​ ​ 865 ​ ​ 2,292 ​ ​ 3,157 ​ ​ 614 ​ ​ 1,736 ​ ​ 2,350 Total ​ 4,385 ​ 6,233 ​ 10,618 ​ 3,562 ​ 4,968 ​ 8,530 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 31 ​ 18 ​ 49 ​ 30 ​ 20 ​ 50 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ $ 11,787 ​ $ 19,820 ​ $ 31,607 ​ $ 8,823 ​ $ 15,084 ​ $ 23,907 ​ Remaining Performance Obligations ​ As of September 30, 2021, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 3.9 billion in the Diagnostics segment and approximately $ 445 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months , approximately 16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. ​ These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. ​ 11 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) ​ Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) ​ Other Contract Assets and Liabilities ​ Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. ​ Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. ​ Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Contract Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ 405 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ ​ 416 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ​ ( 409 ) Balance at September 30, 2021 ​ $ 412 ​ ​ Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information ​ Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were $ 2.092 billion and $ 1.226 billion, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were $ 5.061 billion and $ 2.302 billion, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were $ 2.092 billion and $ 1.226 billion, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were $ 5.061 billion and $ 2.322 billion, respectively. ​ Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2020 include the recognition of $ 20 million of tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to the previous sale of a business that was reported as a discontinued operation. ​ Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first nine months of 2021 includes $ 366 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 990 million. The first nine months of 2020 includes $ 350 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 700 million. ​ The following summarizes the activity for the first nine months of 2021 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ 288 Provisions/charges to income ​ ​ 41 Amounts charged off and other deductions ​ ( 18 ) Balance at September 30, 2021 ​ $ 311 ​ 12 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) ​ Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) ​ The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. ​ The components of long-term investments as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ September 30, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 Long-term Investments: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 758 ​ $ 776 Other ​ 54 ​ 45 Total ​ $ 812 ​ $ 821 ​ The decrease in Abbott’s long-term investments as of September 30, 2021 versus the balance as of December 31, 2020 primarily relates to the sale of an equity method investment. ​ Abbott’s equity securities as of September 30, 2021, include $ 382 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. ​ Abbott also holds certain investments as of September 30, 2021 with a carrying value of $ 269 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $ 91 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. An approximately $ 60 million impairment of an investment was recorded in the second quarter of 2020 for which Abbott had previously recorded an unrealized gain of approximately $ 50 million in 2018. ​ In September 2021, Abbott acquired 100 percent of Walk Vascular, LLC (Walk Vascular), a commercial-stage medical device company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system designed to remove peripheral blood clots. Walk Vascular’s peripheral thrombectomy system will be incorporated into Abbott’s existing endovascular portfolio. The purchase price, the allocation of acquired assets and liabilities, and the revenue and net income contributed by Walk Vascular since the date of acquisition are not material to Abbott’s condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ 13 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) ​ Note 5 — Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ​ The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended September 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains (Losses) ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ Net Actuarial (Losses) and ​ on Derivative Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Prior Service (Costs) and ​ Designated as Cash Flow ​ ​ Adjustments ​ Credits ​ Hedges (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Balance at June 30 ​ $ ( 5,230 ) ​ $ ( 5,713 ) ​ $ ( 3,738 ) ​ $ ( 3,446 ) ​ $ ( 98 ) ​ $ 79 Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ( 391 ) ​ 112 ​ ​ 16 ​ ( 21 ) ​ 70 ​ ( 74 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ — ​ 62 ​ 49 ​ 69 ​ ( 30 ) Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ ( 391 ) ​ 112 ​ 78 ​ 28 ​ 139 ​ ( 104 ) Balance at September 30 ​ $ ( 5,621 ) ​ $ ( 5,601 ) ​ $ ( 3,660 ) ​ $ ( 3,418 ) ​ $ 41 ​ $ ( 25 ) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nine Months Ended September 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains (Losses) ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ Net Actuarial (Losses) and ​ on Derivative Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Prior Service (Costs) and ​ Designated as Cash Flow ​ ​ Adjustments Credits Hedges (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Balance at January 1 ​ $ ( 4,859 ) ​ $ ( 4,924 ) ​ $ ( 3,871 ) ​ $ ( 3,540 ) ​ $ ( 216 ) ​ $ ( 1 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ( 762 ) ​ ( 677 ) ​ ​ 26 ​ ( 23 ) ​ 138 ​ 35 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ ​ — ​ 185 ​ 145 ​ 119 ​ ( 59 ) Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ ( 762 ) ​ ( 677 ) ​ 211 ​ 122 ​ 257 ​ ( 24 ) Balance at September 30 ​ $ ( 5,621 ) ​ $ ( 5,601 ) ​ $ ( 3,660 ) ​ $ ( 3,418 ) ​ $ 41 ​ $ ( 25 ) ​ Reclassified amounts for cash flow hedges are recorded as Cost of products sold.

Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $ 444 million in the first nine months of 2021. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at September 30, 2021 was $ 2.9 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.8 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.4 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first nine months of 2021. ​ Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process R&D (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 929 million as of September 30, 2021 and $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The decrease is due to IPR&D assets primarily related to the Medical Devices segment that became amortizable in 2021, partially offset by an increase of approximately $ 90 million related to a recent acquisition. ​ The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $ 27.8 billion as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and accumulated amortization was $ 15.4 billion as of September 30, 2021 and $ 14.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. Amortizable intangible assets increased by approximately $ 130 million as a result of a recent acquisition and the additional assets are being amortized over 9 years . Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $ 152 million in the first nine months of 2021. In the first nine months of 2021, asset impairments related to the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment decreased intangible assets by $ 13 million. The impairments were recorded in the Cost of products sold, excluding amortization of intangible assets line of Abbott’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.0 billion in 2021, $ 2.1 billion in 2022, $ 2.0 billion in 2023, $ 1.9 billion in 2024 and $ 1.8 billion in 2025. ​ Note 7 — Restructuring Plans ​ On May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $ 499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter included fixed asset write-downs of $ 80 million, inventory-related charges of $ 248 million, and other exit costs, which included contract cancellations and employee-related costs of $ 171 million. ​ In the third quarter of 2021, as the Delta variant of COVID-19 spread and the number of new COVID-19 cases increased significantly particularly in the U.S., demand for rapid COVID-19 tests increased significantly. As a result, in the third quarter Abbott sold approximately $ 120 million of inventory that was previously estimated to have no net realizable value under the second quarter restructuring action. In addition, the estimate of other exit costs was reduced by a net $ 19 million as Abbott fulfilled its purchase obligations under certain contracts for which a liability was recorded in the second quarter or Abbott settled with the counterparty in the third quarter. 15 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) ​ Note 7 — Restructuring Plans (Continued) ​ The following summarizes the activity for the first nine months of 2021 related to this restructuring action and the status of the related accruals as of September 30, 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Inventory- ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Related ​ Fixed Asset ​ Other Exit ​ ​ ​ (in millions) Charges Write-Downs Costs Total Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 ​ $ 248 ​ $ 80 ​ $ 152 ​ $ 480 Payments ​ — ​ — ​ ( 54 ) ​ ( 54 ) Other non-cash ​ ( 248 ) ​ ( 80 ) ​ — ​ ( 328 ) Accrued balance at September 30, 2021 ​ $ — ​ $ — ​ $ 98 ​ $ 98 ​ From 2017 to 2021, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2020, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $ 25 million. In the first nine months of 2021, charges of $ 5 million were recognized, of which $ 1 million is recorded in Cost of products sold and $ 4 million as Selling, general and administrative expense. As of September 30, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $ 10 million and primarily represent severance obligations. ​ From 2017 to 2021, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. In the first nine months of 2021, charges of $ 17 million were recognized, of which $ 1 million is recorded in Cost of products sold and $ 16 million as Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for the first nine months of 2021 related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accrual as of September 30, 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ 70 Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 ​ ​ 17 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 30 ) Accrued balance at September 30, 2021 ​ $ 57 ​ ​ Note 8 — Incentive Stock Programs ​ In the first nine months of 2021, Abbott granted 2,865,115 stock options, 497,373 restricted stock awards and 4,670,845 restricted stock units under its incentive stock program. At September 30, 2021, approximately 101 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2021 is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 29,594,797 ​ 22,674,416 Weighted average remaining life ( years ) 5.8 ​ 4.9 Weighted average exercise price $ 63.08 ​ $ 51.79 Aggregate intrinsic value ( in millions ) $ 1,645 ​ $ 1,504 ​ The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at September 30, 2021 amounted to approximately $ 552 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . ​ 16 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) ​ Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit ​ On September 28, 2020, Abbott repaid the € 1.140 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.00 % Notes due 2020 upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $ 1.3 billion. ​ On June 24, 2020, Abbott completed the issuance of $ 1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $ 650 million of its 1.15 % Notes due 2028 and $ 650 million of its 1.40 % Notes due 2030. ​ Note 10 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures ​ Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 8.7 billion at September 30, 2021 and $ 8.1 billion at December 31, 2020 are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of September 30, 2021 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . ​ Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Abbott held the gross notional amounts of $ 11.4 billion and $ 11.0 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. ​ Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $ 536 million and $ 577 million as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. ​ Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. ​ 17 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) ​ Note 10 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) ​ The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value - Assets ​ Fair Value - Liabilities ​ ​ Sept. 30, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ ​ Sept. 30, ​ Dec. 31, ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 Balance Sheet Caption 2021 2020 Balance Sheet Caption Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ $ 129 $ 210 Deferred income taxes and other assets $ — $ — Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Hedging instruments ​ 193 ​ 30 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 69 ​ 433 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges ​ 45 ​ 60 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 68 ​ 65 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ n/a ​ ​ 536 ​ ​ 577 ​ Long-term debt ​ ​ $ 367 $ 300 ​ ​ $ 673 $ 1,075 ​ ​ ​ The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gain (loss) Recognized in Other ​ Income (expense) and Gain (loss) ​ ​ ​ ​ Comprehensive Income (loss) ​ Reclassified into Income ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ ​ ​ ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Income Statement Caption Foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges ​ $ 96 ​ $ ( 103 ) ​ $ 142 ​ $ 35 ​ $ ( 92 ) ​ $ 48 ​ $ ( 207 ) ​ $ 90 ​ Cost of products sold Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ 4 ​ ( 10 ) ​ 41 ​ ( 20 ) ​ — ​ — ​ — ​ — n/a Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ ( 14 ) ​ ( 11 ) ​ ( 81 ) ​ 184 Interest expense ​ ​ 18 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) ​ Note 10 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) ​ Losses of $ 18 million and $ 100 million were recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as a hedge.

The fair value of debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. ​ The increase in contingent consideration during the year was a result of a recent acquisition. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. ​ 20 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) ​ Note 11 — Litigation and Environmental Matters ​ Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. ​ Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 25 million to $ 45 million. The recorded accrual balance at September 30, 2021 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 35 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ​ Note 12 — Post-Employment Benefits ​ Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized in continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined Benefit Plans ​ Medical and Dental Plans ​ ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Service cost - benefits earned during the period ​ $ 98 ​ $ 85 ​ $ 294 ​ $ 251 ​ $ 14 ​ $ 12 ​ $ 42 ​ $ 35 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations ​ 62 ​ 75 ​ 186 ​ 224 ​ 8 ​ 11 ​ 25 ​ 32 Expected return on plan assets ​ ( 211 ) ​ ( 193 ) ​ ( 633 ) ​ ( 576 ) ​ ( 6 ) ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 20 ) ​ ( 21 ) Net amortization of: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Actuarial loss, net ​ 79 ​ 64 ​ 238 ​ 191 ​ 7 ​ 5 ​ 21 ​ 15 Prior service cost (credit) ​ — ​ — ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 21 ) ​ ( 21 ) Net cost - continuing operations ​ $ 28 ​ $ 31 ​ $ 86 ​ $ 91 ​ $ 16 ​ $ 14 ​ $ 47 ​ $ 40 ​ Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to Internal Revenue Service funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, $ 366 million and $ 350 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans and $ 26 million and $ 11 million, respectively, were contributed to the post-employment medical and dental plans. ​ 21 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) ​ Note 13 — Taxes on Earnings ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $ 97 million and $ 87 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first nine months of 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include approximately $ 81 million in tax benefits related to the settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group’s 2014 through 2016 federal income tax returns in the U.S. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2020 reflect the recognition of $ 20 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $ 80 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. ​ Note 14 — Segment Information ​ Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world. ​ Abbott’s reportable segments are as follows: ​ Established Pharmaceutical Products — International sales of a broad line of branded generic pharmaceutical products. ​ Nutritional Products — Worldwide sales of a broad line of adult and pediatric nutritional products. ​ Diagnostic Products — Worldwide sales of diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, physician offices and alternate-care testing sites.

The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment’s assets. ​ 22 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2021 (Unaudited) ​ Note 14 — Segment Information (Continued) ​ The following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Sales to External Customers ​ Operating Earnings ​ ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Established Pharmaceutical Products ​ $ 1,265 ​ $ 1,099 ​ $ 3,515 ​ $ 3,156 ​ $ 293 ​ $ 201 ​ $ 682 ​ $ 588 Nutritional Products ​ 2,108 ​ 1,924 ​ 6,252 ​ 5,711 ​ 431 ​ 394 ​ 1,388 ​ 1,327 Diagnostic Products ​ 3,912 ​ 2,640 ​ 11,173 ​ 6,460 ​ 1,652 ​ 875 ​ 4,429 ​ 1,802 Medical Devices ​ 3,632 ​ 3,170 ​ 10,618 ​ 8,530 ​ 1,160 ​ 928 ​ 3,375 ​ 2,122 Total Reportable Segments ​ 10,917 ​ 8,833 ​ 31,558 ​ 23,857 ​ 3,536 ​ 2,398 ​ 9,874 ​ ​ 5,839 Other ​ 11 ​ 20 ​ 49 ​ 50 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net sales ​ $ 10,928 ​ $ 8,853 ​ $ 31,607 ​ $ 23,907 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Corporate functions and benefit plan costs ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 204 ) ​ ​ ( 129 ) ​ ​ ( 450 ) ​ ​ ( 367 ) Net interest expense ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 123 ) ​ ​ ( 127 ) ​ ​ ( 370 ) ​ ​ ( 373 ) Share-based compensation (a) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 114 ) ​ ​ ( 100 ) ​ ​ ( 534 ) ​ ​ ( 448 ) Amortization of intangible assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 520 ) ​ ​ ( 510 ) ​ ​ ( 1,533 ) ​ ​ ( 1,624 ) Other, net (b) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 82 ) ​ ​ ( 111 ) ​ ​ ( 1,103 ) ​ ​ ( 447 ) Earnings from continuing operations before taxes ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 2,493 ​ $ 1,421 ​ $ 5,884 ​ $ 2,580 ​ ​ ​ 23 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ​ Financial Review - Results of Operations ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. ​ The following table details sales by reportable segment for the three and nine months ended September 30.

During the third quarter of 2021, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $1.9 billion led by combined sales of approximately $1.6 billion related to Abbott’s BinaxNOW ® , Panbio ® , and ID NOW ® rapid testing platforms. During the third quarter of 2020, COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $0.9 billion. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 13.2 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 12.1 percent. Abbott’s net sales were favorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the third quarter as the relatively weaker U.S. dollar increased total international sales by 1.7 percent and total sales by 1.0 percent. ​ The 29.6 percent increase in total net sales during the first nine months of 2021, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflected demand for Abbott’s tests to detect COVID-19 as well as other growth across Abbott’s reportable segments. During the first nine months of 2021, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $5.4 billion led by combined sales of approximately $4.5 billion related to Abbott’s BinaxNOW, Panbio, and ID NOW rapid testing platforms.

Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 17.3 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 14.9 percent. Abbott’s net sales were favorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first nine months as the relatively weaker U.S. dollar increased total international sales by 4.1 percent and total sales by 2.6 percent. ​ Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the future extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. ​ The table below provides detail by sales category for the nine months ended September 30.

Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in the Key Emerging Markets increased 14.2 percent compared to the first nine months of 2020 led by growth across several geographies, including India, China and Brazil. Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased by 5.4 percent in the first nine months of 2021. ​ International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 1.7 percent in the first nine months of 2021 versus the comparable 2020 period and the decrease reflects lower sales in China, the Middle East and Canada partially offset by higher volumes sold in various countries in Latin America and Europe. U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales increased 8.9 percent primarily due to increased demand for Pedialyte ® , Abbott’s oral rehydration brand, and Similac ® , Abbott’s infant brand. International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased 18.9 percent, and U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 6.0 percent, reflecting continued growth of the Ensure ® and Glucerna ® brands in several countries including the U.S. ​ The 69.2 percent increase in Diagnostic Products sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was driven by demand for Abbott’s portfolio of COVID-19 tests as described above as well as growth in the base Core Laboratory and Molecular businesses. In Core Laboratory, sales increased 16.4 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the increased volume of routine diagnostic testing performed in hospitals and other laboratories, partially offset by lower sales of Abbott’s laboratory-based tests for the detection of the IgG and IgM antibodies, which determine if someone was previously infected with the COVID-19 virus. In March 2021, Abbott received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the U.S. for its AdviseDX SARS-CoV-2 IgG II test for the semi-quantitative detection of IgG antibodies to COVID-19 on its ARCHITECT ® and Alinity ® i platforms. In the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, Core Laboratory IgG and IgM antibody testing-related sales on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were $159 million and $212 million, respectively. In the first nine months of 2021, Core Laboratory sales increased 23.1 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 19.3 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. ​ The 9.9 percent increase in Molecular Diagnostics sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by growth in the base business from the continued roll-out of the Alinity ® m platform as well as higher demand in the first half of 2021 for Abbott’s laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 on its m2000 ® and Alinity m platforms. In the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $699 million and $664 million, respectively. In March 2021, Abbott received an EUA in the U.S. for its multiplex molecular test on its Alinity m system to detect COVID-19, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in one test. In the first nine months of 2021, Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 31.3 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 28.1 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. ​ In Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 195.8 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the demand for Abbott’s COVID-19 tests on its rapid testing platforms, including the Panbio system, the ID NOW platform, and the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test. In the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $4.5 billion and $0.65 billion, respectively. In January 2021, Abbott received CE Mark for two new uses of its Panbio rapid antigen test: asymptomatic testing and self-swabbing under the supervision of a healthcare worker. On March 31, 2021, Abbott announced that it had received an EUA in the U.S. for its over-the-counter, non-prescription BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Self Test for individuals with or without symptoms. In the first quarter of 2021, Abbott also received EUAs that allow the non-prescription use of the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card Home Test and the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test for professional use for individuals with or without symptoms. In June 2021, Abbott announced that it had received CE Mark in Europe for its over-the-counter Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test for individuals with or without symptoms. ​ Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 20.7 percent driven by double-digit growth across all divisions, led by Diabetes Care, Structural Heart and Electrophysiology. Growth in Diabetes Care sales was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, internationally and in the U.S. FreeStyle Libre and Libre Sense ™ sales totaled $2.7 billion in the first nine months of 2021, which reflected a 37.2 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over the first nine months of 2020 when Libre sales totaled $1.9 billion. Libre Sense, which received CE Mark in Europe in the third quarter of 2020, is Abbott’s glucose sport biosensor specifically designed for athletes. ​ 26 Table of Contents While procedure volumes across Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were negatively impacted early in 2021 by elevated COVID-19 case rates in certain countries, including the U.S., overall volumes improved over the course of the first nine months of 2021 across various businesses. The year-over-year increases in the various businesses reflect a recovery from the 2020 levels when the pandemic reduced procedure volumes as well as sales growth from pre-pandemic levels in Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, and Heart Failure, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In January 2021, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services expanded reimbursement coverage eligibility for MitraClip ® , Abbott’s market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR), a leaky heart valve. The growth in Structural Heart during the first nine months of 2021 was broad-based across several areas of the business, including MitraClip and TriClip ® , the world’s first minimally invasive, clip-based device for repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve which was launched in Europe in May 2020. ​ In the first nine months of 2021, various product approvals in the Medical Devices segment included: ​ The gross profit margin percentage was 54.8 percent for the third quarter of 2021 compared to 49.4 percent for the third quarter of 2020. The increase in the quarter reflects the effects of higher sales volume in various businesses, higher utilization at various manufacturing sites, a change in estimate to the restructuring actions recognized in the second quarter related to Abbott’s manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests and the nonrecurrence of the 2020 impairment of an intangible asset. The gross profit margin percentage was 51.6 percent for the first nine months of 2021 compared to 49.2 percent for the first nine months of 2020. The increase primarily reflects the effects of higher sales volume, higher manufacturing utilization, and the nonrecurrence of the 2020 intangible asset impairment, partially offset by the impact of higher restructuring charges in the first nine months of 2021. ​ Research and development expenses increased $92 million, or 16.1 percent, in the third quarter of 2021 and increased $258 million, or 15.0 percent, in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the prior year. The increases in R&D expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 were primarily driven by higher spending on various projects to advance products in development. ​ Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the third quarter of 2021 increased $465 million, or 20.2 percent, and increased $1.15 billion, or 16.1 percent, for the first nine months of 2021, due primarily to higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses and the nonrecurrence of $100 million of income in 2020 from a litigation settlement. The increase in the first nine months of 2021 also includes charges related to certain litigation. ​ Restructuring Plans ​ On May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in the second quarter in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter included fixed asset write-downs of $80 million, inventory-related charges of $248 million, and other exit costs, which included contract cancellations and employee-related costs of $171 million. ​ In the third quarter of 2021, as the Delta variant of COVID-19 spread and the number of new COVID-19 cases increased significantly particularly in the U.S., demand for rapid COVID-19 tests increased significantly. As a result, in the third quarter Abbott sold approximately $120 million of inventory that was previously estimated to have no net realizable value under the second quarter restructuring action. In addition, the estimate of other exit costs was reduced by a net $19 million as Abbott fulfilled its purchase obligations under certain contracts for which a liability was recorded in the second quarter or Abbott settled with the counterparty in the third quarter. ​ 27 Table of Contents Other (Income) Expense, net ​ Other income, net increased from $46 million of income in the third quarter of 2020 to $74 million of income in the third quarter of 2021 and from $25 million of income in the first nine months of 2020 to $214 million of income in the first nine months of 2021. The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to higher income in 2021 related to the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs. The increase in the first nine months of 2021 was primarily due to a $100 million change related to the nonrecurrence of 2020 equity investment impairments, a gain on the sale of an equity method investment in 2021 and higher income in 2021 related to the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs. ​ Interest Expense, net ​ Interest expense, net was virtually unchanged versus the prior year, decreasing $4 million in the third quarter of 2021 and decreasing $3 million in the first nine months of 2021 due to the reduction in interest expense driven by lower interest rates in 2021. The effect of higher cash and short-term investment balances mostly offset the impact of lower interest rates on interest income in the first nine months of 2021. ​ Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $97 million and $87 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first nine months of 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include approximately $81 million in tax benefits related to the settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group’s 2014 through 2016 federal income tax returns in the U.S. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2020 reflect the recognition of $20 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $80 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources September 30, 2021 Compared with December 31, 2020 ​ The increase in cash and cash equivalents from $6.8 billion at December 31, 2020 to $9.3 billion at September 30, 2021 primarily reflects the cash generated from operations in the first nine months of 2021, partially offset by the payment of dividends, capital expenditures and share repurchases. Working capital was $10.6 billion at September 30, 2021 and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in working capital in 2021 primarily reflects the increase in cash and cash equivalents partially offset by an increase in the current portion of long-term debt. ​ In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months of 2021 totaled $7.5 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion over the prior year primarily due to higher operating earnings and improved working capital management, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid. Cash taxes paid in 2021 totaled approximately $990 million versus $700 million in 2020. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities was a use of $140 million for the first nine months of 2021 and a source of $42 million for the first nine months of 2020. The year-over-year change in Other, net in Net cash from operating activities reflects the nonrecurrence of 2020 non-cash impairment charges related to intangible assets and equity investments. ​ In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. As of September 30, 2021, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion authorization remains available. ​ At September 30, 2021, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was A+ by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A2 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2025. ​ 28 Table of Contents In October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. The 2019 authorization was in addition to the approximately $100 million of the share repurchase program authorized in 2014 that remained unused as of December 31, 2020. In the first nine months of 2021, Abbott repurchased 10.1 million of its common shares for $1.187 billion which fully utilized the authorization remaining under the 2014 share repurchase program and a portion of the 2019 authorization. As of September 30, 2021, $1.910 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2019 share repurchase program. ​ On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. No shares have been issued under this authorization. ​ In each of the first three quarters of 2021, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of 25 percent over the $0.36 per share dividend declared in each of the first three quarters of 2020. ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ Legislative Issues ​ Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​ Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements ​ Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and are incorporated herein by reference.

​ The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. ​ Note 2 — New Accounting Standards ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ Note 3 — Revenue ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. ​ 9 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) ​ The following tables provide detail by sales category: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended June 30, 2021 ​ Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 915 ​ $ 915 ​ $ — ​ $ 764 ​ $ 764 Other ​ — ​ 265 ​ 265 ​ — ​ 249 ​ ​ 249 Total ​ — ​ 1,180 ​ 1,180 ​ — ​ 1,013 ​ 1,013 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 528 ​ 565 ​ 1,093 ​ 484 ​ 540 ​ 1,024 Adult Nutritionals ​ 345 ​ 670 ​ 1,015 ​ 324 ​ 535 ​ 859 Total ​ 873 ​ 1,235 ​ 2,108 ​ 808 ​ 1,075 ​ 1,883 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 283 ​ 1,023 ​ 1,306 ​ 289 ​ 698 ​ 987 Molecular ​ 94 ​ 196 ​ 290 ​ 144 ​ 215 ​ 359 Point of Care ​ 97 ​ 40 ​ 137 ​ 79 ​ 39 ​ 118 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 681 ​ 833 ​ 1,514 ​ 345 ​ 185 ​ 530 Total ​ 1,155 ​ 2,092 ​ 3,247 ​ 857 ​ 1,137 ​ 1,994 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 269 ​ 298 ​ 567 ​ 185 ​ 216 ​ 401 Electrophysiology ​ 209 ​ 278 ​ 487 ​ 120 ​ 179 ​ 299 Heart Failure ​ 168 ​ 59 ​ 227 ​ 115 ​ 43 ​ 158 Vascular ​ 246 ​ 451 ​ 697 ​ 168 ​ 313 ​ 481 Structural Heart ​ 191 ​ 231 ​ 422 ​ 91 ​ 132 ​ 223 Neuromodulation ​ 166 ​ 44 ​ 210 ​ 85 ​ 21 ​ 106 Diabetes Care ​ ​ 289 ​ ​ 767 ​ ​ 1,056 ​ ​ 202 ​ ​ 553 ​ ​ 755 Total ​ 1,538 ​ 2,128 ​ 3,666 ​ 966 ​ 1,457 ​ 2,423 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 15 ​ 7 ​ 22 ​ 7 ​ 8 ​ 15 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ $ 3,581 ​ $ 6,642 ​ $ 10,223 ​ $ 2,638 ​ $ 4,690 ​ $ 7,328 ​ 10 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 ​ Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 1,736 ​ $ 1,736 ​ $ — ​ $ 1,577 ​ $ 1,577 Other ​ — ​ 514 ​ 514 ​ — ​ 480 ​ ​ 480 Total ​ — ​ 2,250 ​ 2,250 ​ — ​ 2,057 ​ 2,057 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 1,036 ​ 1,123 ​ 2,159 ​ 1,002 ​ 1,111 ​ 2,113 Adult Nutritionals ​ 673 ​ 1,312 ​ 1,985 ​ 618 ​ 1,056 ​ 1,674 Total ​ 1,709 ​ 2,435 ​ 4,144 ​ 1,620 ​ 2,167 ​ 3,787 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 554 ​ 1,934 ​ 2,488 ​ 556 ​ 1,420 ​ 1,976 Molecular ​ 269 ​ 468 ​ 737 ​ 209 ​ 289 ​ 498 Point of Care ​ 189 ​ 77 ​ 266 ​ 182 ​ 74 ​ 256 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 1,784 ​ 1,986 ​ 3,770 ​ 713 ​ 377 ​ 1,090 Total ​ 2,796 ​ 4,465 ​ 7,261 ​ 1,660 ​ 2,160 ​ 3,820 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 510 ​ 576 ​ 1,086 ​ 413 ​ 462 ​ 875 Electrophysiology ​ 388 ​ 530 ​ 918 ​ 284 ​ 403 ​ 687 Heart Failure ​ 313 ​ 108 ​ 421 ​ 267 ​ 94 ​ 361 Vascular ​ 465 ​ 867 ​ 1,332 ​ 398 ​ 708 ​ 1,106 Structural Heart ​ 360 ​ 439 ​ 799 ​ 227 ​ 314 ​ 541 Neuromodulation ​ 311 ​ 83 ​ 394 ​ 222 ​ 61 ​ 283 Diabetes Care ​ ​ 542 ​ ​ 1,494 ​ ​ 2,036 ​ ​ 388 ​ ​ 1,119 ​ ​ 1,507 Total ​ 2,889 ​ 4,097 ​ 6,986 ​ 2,199 ​ 3,161 ​ 5,360 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 25 ​ 13 ​ 38 ​ 15 ​ 15 ​ 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ $ 7,419 ​ $ 13,260 ​ $ 20,679 ​ $ 5,494 ​ $ 9,560 ​ $ 15,054 ​ Remaining Performance Obligations ​ As of June 30, 2021, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 3.9 billion in the Diagnostics segment and approximately $ 414 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months , approximately 16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. ​ These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. ​ 11 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 3 — Revenue (Continued) ​ Other Contract Assets and Liabilities ​ Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. ​ Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. ​ Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Contract Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ 405 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ ​ 280 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ​ ( 279 ) Balance at June 30, 2021 ​ $ 406 ​ ​ Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information ​ Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $ 1.184 billion and $ 534 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $ 2.969 billion and $ 1.075 billion, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $ 1.184 billion and $ 534 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $ 2.969 billion and $ 1.095 billion, respectively. ​ Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first six months of 2020 include the recognition of $ 20 million of tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to the previous sale of a business that was reported as a discontinued operation. ​ Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first six months of 2021 includes $ 80 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 715 million. The first six months of 2020 includes $ 335 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 285 million. ​ The following summarizes the activity for the first six months of 2021 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of June 30, 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ 288 Provisions/charges to income ​ ​ 31 Amounts charged off and other deductions ​ ( 9 ) Balance at June 30, 2021 ​ $ 310 ​ 12 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued) ​ The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. ​ The components of long-term investments as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 Long-term Investments: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 754 ​ $ 776 Other ​ 51 ​ 45 Total ​ $ 805 ​ $ 821 ​ The decrease in Abbott’s long-term investments as of June 30, 2021 versus the balance as of December 31, 2020 primarily relates to the sale of an equity method investment. ​ Abbott’s equity securities as of June 30, 2021, include $ 388 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. ​ Abbott also holds certain investments as of June 30, 2021 with a carrying value of $ 260 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $ 91 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. An approximately $ 60 million impairment of an investment was recorded in the second quarter of 2020 for which Abbott had previously recorded an unrealized gain of approximately $ 50 million in 2018. ​ Note 5 — Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ​ The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended June 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains (Losses) ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ Net Actuarial (Losses) and ​ on Derivative Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Prior Service (Costs) and ​ Designated as Cash Flow ​ ​ Adjustments ​ Credits ​ Hedges (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Balance at March 31 ​ $ ( 5,395 ) ​ $ ( 6,068 ) ​ $ ( 3,786 ) ​ $ ( 3,483 ) ​ $ ( 104 ) ​ $ 165 Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ 165 ​ 355 ​ ​ ( 12 ) ​ ( 9 ) ​ ( 28 ) ​ ( 67 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ — ​ 60 ​ 46 ​ 34 ​ ( 19 ) Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ 165 ​ 355 ​ 48 ​ 37 ​ 6 ​ ( 86 ) Balance at June 30 ​ $ ( 5,230 ) ​ $ ( 5,713 ) ​ $ ( 3,738 ) ​ $ ( 3,446 ) ​ $ ( 98 ) ​ $ 79 ​ 13 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 5 — Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (Continued) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Six Months Ended June 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains (Losses) ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ Net Actuarial (Losses) and ​ on Derivative Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Prior Service (Costs) and ​ Designated as Cash Flow ​ ​ Adjustments Credits Hedges (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Balance at January 1 ​ $ ( 4,859 ) ​ $ ( 4,924 ) ​ $ ( 3,871 ) ​ $ ( 3,540 ) ​ $ ( 216 ) ​ $ ( 1 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ( 371 ) ​ ( 789 ) ​ ​ 10 ​ ( 2 ) ​ 68 ​ 109 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ ​ — ​ 123 ​ 96 ​ 50 ​ ( 29 ) Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ ( 371 ) ​ ( 789 ) ​ 133 ​ 94 ​ 118 ​ 80 Balance at June 30 ​ $ ( 5,230 ) ​ $ ( 5,713 ) ​ $ ( 3,738 ) ​ $ ( 3,446 ) ​ $ ( 98 ) ​ $ 79 ​ Reclassified amounts for cash flow hedges are recorded as Cost of products sold. Net actuarial losses and prior service cost are included as a component of net periodic benefit costs; see Note 12 for additional details. ​ Note 6 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets ​ The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 23.5 billion at June 30, 2021 and $ 23.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $ 259 million in the first six months of 2021. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at June 30, 2021 was $ 2.9 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.8 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.4 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first six months of 2021. ​ Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process R&D (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 947 million as of June 30, 2021 and $ 1.2 billion at December 31, 2020. The decrease is due to IPR&D assets primarily related to the Medical Devices segment that became amortizable in the second quarter of 2021. ​ The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $ 27.8 billion as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and accumulated amortization was $ 15.1 billion as of June 30, 2021 and $ 14.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $ 83 million in the first six months of 2021. In the second quarter of 2021, an asset impairment related to the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment decreased intangible assets by $ 11 million. The impairment was recorded in the Cost of products sold, excluding amortization of intangible assets line of Abbott’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.0 billion in 2021 and 2022, and $ 1.9 billion in 2023, 2024 , and 2025 . ​ Note 7 — Restructuring Plans ​ On May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. Abbott estimates that the total pre-tax cost to implement this restructuring plan will be approximately $ 500 million to $ 625 million, including fixed asset write-downs of $ 80 million to $ 115 million, inventory-related charges of $ 250 million to $ 260 million, and other exit costs of $ 170 million to $ 250 million. Other exit costs include contract cancellation and employee-related costs. Actions associated with this plan are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2021. ​ 14 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 7 — Restructuring Plans (Continued) ​ In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $ 499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter includes fixed asset write-downs of $ 80 million, inventory-related charges of $ 248 million, and other exit costs, which include contract cancellations and employee-related costs of $ 171 million. Other exit costs will result in future cash outlays that are expected to be made primarily over the next 6 months. The following summarizes the activity for the first six months of 2021 related to this restructuring action and the status of the related accruals as of June 30, 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Inventory ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Related ​ Fixed Asset ​ Other Exit ​ ​ ​ (in millions) Charges Write-Downs Costs Total Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 ​ $ 248 ​ $ 80 ​ $ 171 ​ $ 499 Payments ​ — ​ — ​ ( 19 ) ​ ( 19 ) Other-non-cash ​ ( 248 ) ​ ( 80 ) ​ — ​ ( 328 ) Accrued balance at June 30, 2021 ​ $ — ​ $ — ​ $ 152 ​ $ 152 ​ From 2017 to 2021, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2020, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $ 25 million. In the first six months of 2021, charges of $ 4 million were recognized, of which $ 1 million is recorded in Cost of products sold and $ 3 million as Selling, general and administrative expense. As of June 30, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $ 15 million and primarily represent severance obligations. ​ From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. In the first six months of 2021, charges of $ 1 million were recognized as Cost of products sold. The following summarizes the activity for the first six months of 2021 related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accrual as of June 30, 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ 70 Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 ​ ​ 1 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 24 ) Accrued balance at June 30, 2021 ​ $ 47 ​ ​ Note 8 — Incentive Stock Programs ​ In the first six months of 2021, Abbott granted 2,730,398 stock options, 478,490 restricted stock awards and 4,624,439 restricted stock units under its incentive stock program. At June 30, 2021, approximately 101 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2021 is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 30,091,814 ​ 23,273,096 Weighted average remaining life ( years ) 6.0 ​ 5.2 Weighted average exercise price $ 62.45 ​ $ 51.56 Aggregate intrinsic value ( in millions ) $ 1,631 ​ $ 1,498 ​ The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at June 30, 2021 amounted to approximately $ 645 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . ​ 15 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit ​ On June 24, 2020, Abbott completed the issuance of $ 1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $ 650 million of its 1.15 % Notes due 2028 and $ 650 million of its 1.40 % Notes due 2030. ​ Note 10 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures ​ Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 8.8 billion at June 30, 2021 and $ 8.1 billion at December 31, 2020 are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of June 30, 2021 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . ​ Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Abbott held the gross notional amounts of $ 10.0 billion and $ 11.0 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. ​ Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $ 540 million and $ 577 million as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. ​ Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. ​ The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value - Assets ​ Fair Value - Liabilities ​ ​ June 30, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ ​ June 30, ​ Dec. 31, ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 Balance Sheet Caption 2021 2020 Balance Sheet Caption Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ $ 143 $ 210 Deferred income taxes and other assets $ — $ — Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Hedging instruments ​ 98 ​ 30 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 151 ​ 433 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges ​ 43 ​ 60 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 67 ​ 65 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ n/a ​ ​ 540 ​ ​ 577 ​ Long-term debt ​ ​ $ 284 $ 300 ​ ​ $ 758 $ 1,075 ​ ​ ​ 16 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 10 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued) ​ The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gain (loss) Recognized in Other ​ Income (expense) and Gain (loss) ​ ​ ​ ​ Comprehensive Income (loss) ​ Reclassified into Income ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ ​ ​ ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Income Statement Caption Foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges ​ $ ( 88 ) ​ $ ( 89 ) ​ $ 46 ​ $ 138 ​ $ ( 92 ) ​ $ 31 ​ $ ( 115 ) ​ $ 42 ​ Cost of products sold Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ 2 ​ ( 2 ) ​ 37 ​ ( 10 ) ​ — ​ — ​ — ​ — n/a Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ 2 ​ 27 ​ ( 67 ) ​ 195 Interest expense ​ Losses of $ 16 million and gains of $ 67 million were recognized in the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as a hedge.

The fair value of debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. ​ Note 11 — Litigation and Environmental Matters ​ Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. ​ 18 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 11 — Litigation and Environmental Matters (Continued) ​ Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 255 million to $ 280 million. The recorded accrual balance at June 30, 2021 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 265 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ​ Note 12 — Post-Employment Benefits ​ Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized in continuing operations for the three and six months ended June 30 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined Benefit Plans ​ Medical and Dental Plans ​ ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ Three Months ​ Six Months (in millions) ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Service cost — benefits earned during the period ​ $ 96 ​ $ 81 ​ $ 196 ​ $ 166 ​ $ 14 ​ $ 11 ​ $ 28 ​ $ 23 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations ​ 62 ​ 74 ​ 124 ​ 149 ​ 9 ​ 9 ​ 17 ​ 21 Expected return on plan assets ​ ( 211 ) ​ ( 191 ) ​ ( 422 ) ​ ( 383 ) ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 14 ) ​ ( 14 ) Net amortization of: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Actuarial loss, net ​ 78 ​ 64 ​ 159 ​ 127 ​ 7 ​ 2 ​ 14 ​ 10 Prior service cost (credit) ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 14 ) ​ ( 14 ) Net cost — continuing operations ​ $ 26 ​ $ 29 ​ $ 58 ​ $ 60 ​ $ 16 ​ $ 8 ​ $ 31 ​ $ 26 ​ Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to Internal Revenue Service funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first six months of 2021 and 2020, $ 80 million and $ 335 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans. Contributions made to post-employment medical and dental plans in the first six months of 2020 were $ 11 million. No contributions were made to the post-employment medical and dental plans in the first six months of 2021. ​ Note 13 — Taxes on Earnings ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first six months of 2021 and 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $ 90 million and $ 67 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first six months of 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include approximately $ 81 million in tax benefits related to the settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group’s 2014 through 2016 federal income tax returns in the U.S. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first six months of 2020 reflect the recognition of $ 20 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $ 80 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. ​ 19 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 14 — Segment Information ​ Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.

During the second quarter of 2021, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $1.3 billion led by combined sales of approximately $1.0 billion related to Abbott’s BinaxNOW ® , Panbio ® , and ID NOW ® rapid-testing platforms. During the second quarter of 2020, COVID-19 testing related sales totaled approximately $0.6 billion. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 33.2 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 28.9 percent. Abbott’s net sales were favorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the second quarter as the relatively weaker U.S. dollar increased total international sales by 7.0 percent and total sales by 4.5 percent. ​ The 33.9 percent increase in total net sales during the first six months of 2021, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, reflected demand for Abbott’s tests to detect COVID-19 as well as other growth across Abbott’s reportable segments. During the first six months of 2021, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $3.5 billion led by combined sales of approximately $2.8 billion related to Abbott’s BinaxNOW, Panbio, and ID NOW rapid-testing platforms. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 19.5 percent. During the first six months of 2020, COVID-19 testing related sales totaled approximately $0.6 billion. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 16.5 percent. Abbott’s net sales were favorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first six months as the relatively weaker U.S. dollar increased total international sales by 5.4 percent and total sales by 3.5 percent. ​ Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the future extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. ​ The table below provides detail by sales category for the six months ended June 30.

Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in the Key Emerging Markets increased 12.4 percent compared to the first six months of 2020 led by growth across several geographies including India, China and Brazil. Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased by 3.4 percent in the first six months of 2021. ​ International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 1.4 percent in the first six months of 2021 versus the comparable 2020 period and the decrease reflects lower sales in China, the Middle East and Canada partially offset by higher volumes sold in various countries in Latin America and Europe. U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales increased 3.4 percent primarily due to increased demand for Pedialyte ® , Abbott’s oral rehydration brand, and Pediasure ® . International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased 21.6 percent, and U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 8.9 percent, reflecting continued growth of the Ensure ® and Glucerna ® brands in several countries including the U.S. ​ The 84.7 percent increase in Diagnostic Products sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was driven by demand for Abbott’s portfolio of COVID-19 tests as described above as well as growth in the base Core Laboratory and Molecular businesses. In Core Laboratory, sales increased 21.4 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the increased volume of routine diagnostic testing performed in hospitals and other laboratories, partially offset by lower sales of Abbott’s laboratory-based tests for the detection of the IgG and IgM antibodies, which determine if someone was previously infected with the COVID-19 virus. In March 2021, Abbott received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the U.S. for its AdviseDX SARS-CoV-2 IgG II test for the semi-quantitative detection of IgG antibodies to COVID-19 on its ARCHITECT ® and Alinity ® i platforms. In the first six months of 2021 and 2020, Core Laboratory IgG and IgM antibody testing-related sales on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were $112 million and $148 million, respectively. In the first six months of 2021, Core Laboratory sales increased 30.0 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 25.1 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. ​ The 42.7 percent increase in Molecular Diagnostics sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 on its m2000™ and Alinity ® m platforms as well as growth in the base business from the continued roll-out of the Alinity m platform. In the first six months of 2021 and 2020, Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $480 million and $312 million,respectively. In March 2021, Abbott received an EUA in the U.S. for its multiplex molecular test on its Alinity m system to detect COVID-19, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in one test. In the first six months of 2021, Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 37.8 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 34.0 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. ​ In Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 237.9 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the demand for Abbott’s COVID-19 tests on its rapid testing platforms including the Panbio system, the ID NOW platform, and the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test. In the first six months of 2021 and 2020, Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $2.8 billion and $182 million, respectively. In January 2021, Abbott received CE Mark for two new uses of its Panbio rapid antigen test: asymptomatic testing and self-swabbing under the supervision of a healthcare worker. On March 31, 2021, Abbott announced that it had received an EUA in the U.S. for its over-the-counter, non-prescription BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Self Test for individuals with or without symptoms. In the first quarter of 2021, Abbott also received EUAs that allow the non-prescription use of the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card Home Test and the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test for professional use for individuals with or without symptoms. In June 2021, Abbott announced that it had received CE Mark in Europe for its over-the-counter Panbio COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test for individuals with or without symptoms. ​ Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 25.2 percent driven by double-digit growth across all divisions, led by Diabetes Care, Structural Heart and Electrophysiology. Growth in Diabetes Care sales was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, internationally and in the U.S. FreeStyle Libre and Libre Sense ® sales totaled $1.733 billion in the first six months of 2021, which reflected a 36.3 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over the first six months of 2020 when Libre sales totaled $1.197 billion. Libre Sense, which received CE Mark in Europe in the third quarter of 2020, is Abbott’s glucose sport biosensor specifically designed for athletes. ​ 24 Table of Contents While procedure volumes across Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were negatively impacted early in 2021 by elevated COVID-19 case rates in certain countries, including the U.S., volumes improved over the course of the first six months of 2021 across the various businesses. The year-over-year increases in the various businesses reflect a recovery from the 2020 levels when the pandemic reduced procedure volumes as well as sales growth from pre-pandemic levels in Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, and Heart Failure, excluding the effect of foreign exchange. In January 2021, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services expanded reimbursement coverage eligibility for MitraClip ® , Abbott’s market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR), a leaky heart valve. The growth in Structural Heart during the first six months of 2021 was broad-based across several areas of the business, including MitraClip, and TriClip ® , the world’s first minimally invasive, clip-based device for repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve which was launched in Europe in May 2020. In May 2021, Abbott announced that it had received CE Mark in Europe for Navitor™, its latest-generation transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at high or extreme surgical risk. ​ The gross profit margin percentage was 46.7 percent for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 47.9 percent for the second quarter of 2020. The decline in the quarter reflects the impact of the $499 million charge recognized in Cost of products sold in 2021 related to the restructuring plan to align the manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with the change in demand for these tests. The impact of the $499 million charge on gross profit margin was partially offset by the effects of higher sales volume in various businesses, higher utilization at various manufacturing sites and a decrease in amortization expense in 2021. The gross profit margin percentage was 49.9 percent for the first six months of 2021 compared to 49.1 percent for the first six months of 2020. The increase primarily reflects the positive factors that also affected the gross profit margin for the second quarter of 2021, partially offset by the impact of higher restructuring charges in the first six months of 2021. ​ Research and development expenses increased $90 million, or 15.7 percent, in the second quarter of 2021 and increased $166 million, or 14.5 percent in the first six months of 2021 compared to the prior year. The increases in R&D expenses in the second quarter and first six months of 2021 were primarily driven by higher spending on various projects to advance products in development. ​ Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the second quarter of 2021 increased $450 million, or 19.8 percent, and increased $685 million, or 14.2 percent for the first six months of 2021, due primarily to higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses and charges related to certain litigation. ​ Restructuring Plans ​ On May 27, 2021, Abbott management approved a restructuring plan related to its Diagnostic Products segment to align its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with changes in projected testing demand driven by several factors, including significant reductions in cases in the U.S. and other major developed countries, the accelerated rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally and the U.S. health authority’s updated guidance on testing for fully vaccinated individuals. Abbott estimates that the total pre-tax cost to implement this restructuring plan will be approximately $500 million to $625 million, including fixed asset write-downs of $80 million to $115 million, inventory-related charges of $250 million to $260 million, and other exit costs of $170 million to $250 million. Other exit costs include contract cancellation and employee-related costs. Actions associated with this plan are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2021. ​ In the second quarter of 2021, Abbott recorded charges of $499 million under this plan in Cost of products sold. The charge recognized in the second quarter includes fixed asset write-downs of $80 million, inventory-related charges of $248 million, and other exit costs, which include contract cancellations and employee-related costs of $171 million. Other exit costs will result in future cash outlays that are expected to be made primarily over the next six months. ​ Other (Income) Expense, net ​ Other income, net increased from $22 million of expense in the second quarter of 2020 to $79 million of income in the second quarter of 2021 and from $21 million of expense in the first six months of 2020 to $140 million of income in the first six months of 2021. The increases were primarily due to the nonrecurrence of equity investment impairments that totaled approximately $60 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $110 million in the first six months of 2020, a gain on the sale of an equity method investment in the second quarter of 2021 and higher income in the second quarter and first six months of 2021 related to the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs. ​ 25 Table of Contents Interest Expense, net ​ Interest expense, net was virtually unchanged versus the prior year, decreasing $2 million in the second quarter of 2021 and increasing $1 million in the first six months of 2021 as lower interest rates resulted in a decline in interest income that exceeded the reduction in interest expense. The effect of higher cash and short-term investment balances on interest income more than offset the net impact of lower interest rates in the second quarter and mostly offset the impact of lower interest rates in the first six months of 2021. ​ Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first six months of 2021 and 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $90 million and $67 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. In the first six months of 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations also include approximately $81 million in tax benefits related to the settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group’s 2014 through 2016 federal income tax returns in the U.S. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first six months of 2020 reflect the recognition of $20 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $80 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources June 30, 2021 Compared with December 31, 2020 ​ The increase in cash and cash equivalents from $6.8 billion at December 31, 2020 to $8.7 billion at June 30, 2021 primarily reflects the cash generated from operations in the first six months of 2021, partially offset by the payment of dividends, capital expenditures and share repurchases. Working capital was $10.0 billion at June 30, 2021 and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in working capital in 2021 primarily reflects the increase in cash and cash equivalents partially offset by an increase in the current portion of long-term debt. ​ In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2021 totaled $4.8 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion over the prior year primarily due to higher operating earnings, improved working capital management and the timing of pension contributions partially offset by higher cash taxes paid. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities was a use of $103 million for the first six months of 2021 and a use of $205 million for the first six months of 2020. The year-over-year change in Other, net in Net cash from operating activities is primarily due to the timing of pension contributions as pension contributions were $80 million in 2021 and $335 million in 2020, the payment timing for various accrued expenses associated with litigation and restructuring actions in 2021, and the $80 million non-cash restructuring charge in 2021 to recognize the write-down of COVID-19 manufacturing-related fixed assets, which was partially offset by the higher cash taxes paid in 2021 of approximately $715 million versus the $285 million paid in 2020. ​ In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. As of June 30, 2021, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion authorization remains available. ​ At June 30, 2021, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was A+ by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A2 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2025. ​ In October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. The 2019 authorization was in addition to the approximately $100 million of the share repurchase program authorized in 2014 that remained unused as of December 31, 2020. In June 2021, Abbott repurchased 4.5 million of its common shares for $502 million which fully utilized the authorization remaining under the 2014 share repurchase program and a portion of the 2019 authorization. As of June 30, 2021, $2.595 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2019 share repurchase program. ​ On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. No shares have been issued under this authorization. ​ 26 Table of Contents In each of the first two quarters of 2021, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of 25 percent over the $0.36 per share dividend declared in each of the first two quarters of 2020. ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ Legislative Issues ​ Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​ Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements ​ Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 1 — Basis of Presentation ​ The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. ​ Note 2 — New Accounting Standards ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ Note 3 — Revenue ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. ​ 8 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2021 (Unaudited) The following table provides revenues by sales category: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 ​ Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 821 ​ $ 821 ​ $ — ​ $ 813 ​ $ 813 Other ​ — ​ 249 ​ 249 ​ — ​ 231 ​ ​ 231 Total ​ — ​ 1,070 ​ 1,070 ​ — ​ 1,044 ​ 1,044 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 508 ​ 558 ​ 1,066 ​ 518 ​ 571 ​ 1,089 Adult Nutritionals ​ 328 ​ 642 ​ 970 ​ 294 ​ 521 ​ 815 Total ​ 836 ​ 1,200 ​ 2,036 ​ 812 ​ 1,092 ​ 1,904 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 271 ​ 911 ​ 1,182 ​ 267 ​ 722 ​ 989 Molecular ​ 175 ​ 272 ​ 447 ​ 65 ​ 74 ​ 139 Point of Care ​ 92 ​ 37 ​ 129 ​ 103 ​ 35 ​ 138 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 1,103 ​ 1,153 ​ 2,256 ​ 368 ​ 192 ​ 560 Total ​ 1,641 ​ 2,373 ​ 4,014 ​ 803 ​ 1,023 ​ 1,826 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 241 ​ 278 ​ 519 ​ 228 ​ 246 ​ 474 Electrophysiology ​ 179 ​ 252 ​ 431 ​ 164 ​ 224 ​ 388 Heart Failure ​ 145 ​ 49 ​ 194 ​ 152 ​ 51 ​ 203 Vascular ​ 219 ​ 416 ​ 635 ​ 230 ​ 395 ​ 625 Structural Heart ​ 169 ​ 208 ​ 377 ​ 136 ​ 182 ​ 318 Neuromodulation ​ 145 ​ 39 ​ 184 ​ 137 ​ 40 ​ 177 Diabetes Care ​ ​ 253 ​ ​ 727 ​ ​ 980 ​ ​ 186 ​ ​ 566 ​ ​ 752 Total ​ 1,351 ​ 1,969 ​ 3,320 ​ 1,233 ​ 1,704 ​ 2,937 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 10 ​ 6 ​ 16 ​ 8 ​ 7 ​ 15 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ $ 3,838 ​ $ 6,618 ​ $ 10,456 ​ $ 2,856 ​ $ 4,870 ​ $ 7,726 ​ Remaining Performance Obligations ​ As of March 31, 2021, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 3.8 billion in the Diagnostics segment and approximately $ 400 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months , approximately 17 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. ​ These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. ​ Other Contract Assets and Liabilities ​ Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. ​ Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. 9 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2021 (Unaudited) Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Contract Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ 405 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ ​ 174 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ​ ( 163 ) Balance at March 31, 2021 ​ $ 416 ​ ​ Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information ​ Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were $ 1.785 billion and $ 541 million, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 were $ 1.785 billion and $ 561 million, respectively. ​ Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first quarter of 2020 include the recognition of $ 20 million of tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to the previous sale of a business that was reported as a discontinued operation. ​ Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first three months of 2021 includes $ 16 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 270 million. The first three months of 2020 includes $ 320 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 125 million. ​ The following summarizes the activity for the first three months of 2021 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31, 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ 288 Provisions/charges to income ​ ​ 15 Amounts charged off and other deductions ​ ( 8 ) Balance at March 31, 2021 ​ $ 295 ​ The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. ​ The components of long-term investments as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ March 31, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 Long-term Investments: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 785 ​ $ 776 Other ​ 47 ​ 45 Total ​ $ 832 ​ $ 821 ​ 10 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2021 (Unaudited) Abbott’s equity securities as of March 31, 2021, include $ 375 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc.

Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $ 360 million in the first three months of 2021. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at March 31, 2021 was $ 2.9 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.8 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.3 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first three months of 2021. ​ The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $ 27.5 billion as of March 31, 2021 and $ 27.8 billion as of December 31, 2020, and accumulated amortization was $ 14.5 billion as of March 31, 2021 and $ 14.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $ 94 million in the first three months of 2021. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.0 billion in 2021 and 2022, and $ 1.9 billion in 2023, 2024 , and 2025 . ​ Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process R&D acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 1.2 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 . ​ 11 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 7 — Restructuring Plans ​ From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. As of December 31, 2020, the accrued balance associated with these actions was $ 25 million. No additional charges were recognized in the first three months of 2021. As of March 31, 2021, the accrued liabilities remaining in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these actions total $ 13 million and primarily represent severance obligations. ​ From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. In the first three months of 2021, charges of $ 1 million were recognized as Cost of products sold. The following summarizes the activity for the first three months of 2021 related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accrual as of March 31, 2021: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2020 ​ $ 70 Restructuring charges recorded in 2021 ​ ​ 1 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 13 ) Accrued balance at March 31, 2021 ​ $ 58 ​ ​ Note 8 — Incentive Stock Program ​ In the first three months of 2021, Abbott granted 2,693,918 stock options, 478,490 restricted stock awards and 4,511,126 restricted stock units under its incentive stock program. At March 31, 2021, approximately 101 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at March 31, 2021 is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 30,484,541 ​ 23,519,084 Weighted average remaining life ( years ) 6.2 ​ 5.4 Weighted average exercise price $ 62.17 ​ $ 51.23 Aggregate intrinsic value ( in millions ) $ 1,769 ​ $ 1,614 ​ The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at March 31, 2021 amounted to approximately $ 744 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . ​ Note 9 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures ​ Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 8.6 billion at March 31, 2021 and $ 8.1 billion at December 31, 2020 are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of March 31, 2021 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . ​ Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Abbott held the gross notional amount of $ 10.2 billion and $ 11.0 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. ​ 12 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2021 (Unaudited) Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $ 542 million and $ 577 million as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. ​ Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. ​ The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value - Assets ​ Fair Value - Liabilities ​ ​ March 31, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ ​ March 31, ​ Dec. 31, ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 Balance Sheet Caption 2021 2020 Balance Sheet Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ $ 141 $ 210 Deferred income taxes and other assets $ — $ — Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Hedging instruments ​ 105 ​ 30 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 167 ​ 433 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges ​ 76 ​ 60 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 92 ​ 65 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ n/a ​ ​ 542 ​ ​ 577 ​ Long-term debt ​ ​ $ 322 $ 300 ​ ​ $ 801 $ 1,075 ​ ​ ​ The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gain (loss) Recognized in ​ Income (expense) and ​ ​ ​ ​ Other Comprehensive ​ Gain (loss) Reclassified ​ ​ ​ ​ Income (loss) ​ into Income ​ ​ (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Income Statement Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges ​ $ 134 ​ $ 227 ​ $ ( 23 ) ​ $ 11 ​ Cost of products sold Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ 35 ​ ( 8 ) ​ — ​ — n/a Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ ( 69 ) ​ 168 Interest expense ​ Gains of $ 49 million and losses of $ 165 million were recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as a hedge.

The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions.

The fair value of debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. ​ Note 10 — Litigation and Environmental Matters ​ Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. ​ Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 215 million to $ 250 million. The recorded accrual balance at March 31, 2021 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 230 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ​ Note 11 — Post-Employment Benefits ​ Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized in continuing operations for the three months ended March 31 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined Benefit Plans ​ Medical and Dental Plans ​ ​ March 31, ​ March 31, ​ March 31, ​ March 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Service cost — benefits earned during the period ​ $ 100 ​ $ 85 ​ $ 14 ​ $ 12 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations ​ 62 ​ 75 ​ 8 ​ 12 Expected return on plan assets ​ ( 211 ) ​ ( 192 ) ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 7 ) Net amortization of: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Actuarial loss, net ​ 81 ​ 63 ​ 7 ​ 8 Prior service cost (credit) ​ — ​ — ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 7 ) Net cost — continuing operations ​ $ 32 ​ $ 31 ​ $ 15 ​ $ 18 ​ Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to IRS funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first three months of 2021 and 2020, $ 16 million and $ 320 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans. Contributions made to post-employment medical and dental plans in the first three months of 2020 were $ 11 million. No contributions were made to the post-employment medical and dental plans in the first three months of 2021. ​ 15 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2021 (Unaudited) Note 12 — Taxes on Earnings ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2021 and 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $ 80 million and $ 47 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first three months of 2020 reflect the recognition of $ 20 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $ 50 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. ​ Note 13 — Segment Information ​ Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world. ​ Abbott’s reportable segments are as follows: ​ Established Pharmaceutical Products — International sales of a broad line of branded generic pharmaceutical products. ​ Nutritional Products — Worldwide sales of a broad line of adult and pediatric nutritional products. ​ Diagnostic Products — Worldwide sales of diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and alternate-care testing sites. For segment reporting purposes, the Core Laboratories Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care divisions are aggregated and reported as the Diagnostic Products segment. ​ Medical Devices — Worldwide sales of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care products. For segment reporting purposes, the Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure, Vascular, Neuromodulation, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care divisions are aggregated and reported as the Medical Devices segment. ​ Abbott’s underlying accounting records are maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting requirements. Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment’s assets. ​ 16 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2021 (Unaudited) The following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended March 31 ​ ​ Net Sales to External Customers ​ Operating Earnings (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Established Pharmaceutical Products ​ $ 1,070 ​ $ 1,044 ​ $ 169 ​ $ 181 Nutritional Products ​ 2,036 ​ 1,904 ​ 467 ​ 459 Diagnostic Products ​ 4,014 ​ 1,826 ​ 1,701 ​ 405 Medical Devices ​ 3,320 ​ 2,937 ​ 1,007 ​ 803 Total Reportable Segments ​ 10,440 ​ 7,711 ​ 3,344 ​ 1,848 Other ​ 16 ​ 15 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net sales ​ $ 10,456 ​ $ 7,726 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Corporate functions and benefit plans costs ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 114 ) ​ ​ ( 132 ) Net interest expense ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 124 ) ​ ​ ( 121 ) Share-based compensation (a) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 288 ) ​ ​ ( 233 ) Amortization of intangible assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 509 ) ​ ​ ( 561 ) Other, net (b) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 266 ) ​ ​ ( 168 ) Earnings from continuing operations before taxes ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 2,043 ​ $ 633 ​ ​ 17 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ​ Financial Review - Results of Operations ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. ​ The following table details sales by reportable segment for the three months ended March 31. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Sales to External Customers ​ Three Months Three Months ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Ended ​ Ended ​ ​ ​ Impact of ​ Total Change ​ ​ March 31, ​ March 31, ​ Total ​ Foreign ​ Excl.

During the first quarter of 2021, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing-related sales totaled approximately $2.2 billion led by combined sales of approximately $1.8 billion related to Abbott’s BinaxNOW, Panbio, and ID NOW rapid-testing platforms. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 testing-related sales, Abbott’s total net sales increased 7.6 percent. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 testing-related sales and foreign exchange, Abbott’s total net sales increased 5.7 percent. Abbott’s net sales were favorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first quarter as the relatively weaker U.S. dollar increased total international sales by 3.9 percent and total sales by 2.4 percent. ​ Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. ​ 18 Table of Contents The table below provides detail by sales category for the three months ended March 31.

Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in the Key Emerging Markets increased 6.7 percent compared to the first three months of 2020 led by growth across several geographies including China, India and Brazil. Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased by 4.2 percent in the first three months of 2021. ​ International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 3.1 percent in the first three months of 2021 versus the comparable 2020 period. U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales decreased 1.8 percent. The decrease in Abbott’s Pediatric Nutritional sales was primarily due to higher consumer purchases in 2020 in several countries, including the U.S., in advance of shelter-in-place restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher sales in the Greater China infant category in 2021. International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased 22.1 percent, and U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 11.4 percent, reflecting continued growth of the Ensure ® and Glucerna ® brands in several countries including the U.S. ​ The 114.8 percent increase in Diagnostic Products sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was driven by strong demand for Abbott’s portfolio of COVID-19 tests as described above as well as improvements in the base Core Laboratory and Molecular businesses. In Core Laboratory, sales increased 16.1 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to the increased volume of routine diagnostic testing performed in hospitals and other laboratories as well as sales of Abbott’s laboratory-based tests for the detection of the IgG and IgM antibodies, which determine if someone was previously infected with the COVID-19 virus. Core Laboratory IgG and IgM antibody testing-related sales on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were approximately $50 million in the first three months of 2021. In March 2021, Abbott received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the U.S. for its AdviseDX SARS-CoV-2 IgG II test for the semi-quantitative detection of IgG antibodies to COVID-19 on its ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms. In the first three months of 2021, Core Laboratory sales increased 14.1 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 10.7 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. ​ 19 Table of Contents The 212.0 percent increase in Molecular Diagnostics sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 on its m2000 and Alinity m platforms as well as growth in the base business from the continued roll-out of the Alinity m platform. Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were approximately $310 million in the first three months of 2021. In March 2021, Abbott received an EUA in the U.S. for its multiplex molecular test on its Alinity m system to detect COVID-19, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in one test. In the first three months of 2021, Molecular Diagnostics sales increased 33.9 percent, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, and increased 31.5 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-19 testing-related sales. ​ In Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 295.0 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to strong demand for Abbott’s COVID-19 tests on its rapid testing platforms including the Panbio system, the ID NOW platform, and the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test. Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were approximately $1.8 billion in the first three months of 2021. In January 2021, Abbott received CE Mark for two new uses of its Panbio rapid antigen test: asymptomatic testing and self-swabbing under the supervision of a healthcare worker. On March 31, 2021, Abbott announced that it had received an EUA in the U.S. for its over-the-counter, non-prescription BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Self Test for individuals with or without symptoms. In the first quarter of 2021, Abbott also received EUAs that allow the non-prescription use of the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card Home Test and the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test for professional use for individuals with or without symptoms. ​ Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 8.8 percent driven by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care and Structural Heart as well as growth in Electrophysiology and Rhythm Management. Growth in Diabetes Care sales was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, internationally and in the U.S. FreeStyle Libre and Libre Sense™ sales totaled $829 million in the first quarter of 2021, which reflected a 29.8 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over the first three months of 2020 when Libre sales totaled $604 million. Libre Sense, which received CE Mark in the third quarter of 2020, is Abbott’s glucose sport biosensor specifically designed for athletes. ​ While procedure volumes across Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were negatively impacted early in 2021 by elevated COVID-19 case rates in certain countries, including the U.S., volumes improved over the course of the quarter for many products. Growth in Structural Heart was broad-based across several areas of the business, including TriClip ® , the world’s first minimally invasive, clip-based device for repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve which was launched in Europe in May 2020, and MitraClip ® , Abbott’s market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR), a leaky heart valve. In January 2021, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services expanded reimbursement coverage eligibility for MitraClip. ​ Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, the 6.2 percent decline in Heart Failure sales reflects fewer left ventricular assist device (LVAD) procedures as such procedures, which require a stay in the hospital’s intensive care unit, continued to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first quarter of 2021. The sales decline also reflects the initial spread of the pandemic driving higher demand in the first quarter of 2020 for Abbott’s CentriMag™ circulatory support systems which are used in acute hospital care. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, the 2.0 percent decline in Vascular sales reflects price reductions on drug-eluting stents across various geographies and lower sales in China due to a new national tender program instituted in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by the improvement in procedure volume trends in various countries. ​ The gross profit margin percentage was 53.0 percent for the first quarter of 2021 compared to 50.3 percent for the first quarter of 2020. The increase primarily reflects higher sales volume in various businesses, higher utilization at various manufacturing sites, and a decrease in intangible amortization expense in 2021. ​ Research and development expenses increased $76 million, or 13.3 percent, in the first quarter of 2021. The 2021 increase in R&D expense was primarily driven by higher spending on various projects to advance products in development. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, research and development expenditures totaled $317 million for the Medical Devices segment, $168 million for the Diagnostic Products segment, $45 million for the Nutritional Products segment and $50 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. ​ Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter of 2021 increased $235 million, or 9.2 percent, due primarily to charges related to certain litigation and higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses. ​ 20 Table of Contents Other (Income) Expense, net ​ Other income, net increased from $1 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $61 million in the first quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to an impairment of an equity investment of approximately $50 million in 2020 as well as higher income in the first quarter of 2021 related to the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs. ​ Interest Expense, net ​ Interest expense, net increased $3 million in the first quarter of 2021 as lower interest rates resulted in a decline in interest income that exceeded the reduction in interest expense. The net impact of lower interest rates was partially offset by the effect of higher cash and short-term investment balances on interest income. ​ Taxes on Earnings ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2021 and 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $80 million and $47 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first three months of 2020 reflect the recognition of $20 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $50 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources March 31, 2021 Compared with December 31, 2020 ​ The increase in cash and cash equivalents from $6.8 billion at December 31, 2020 to $8.1 billion at March 31, 2021 primarily reflects the cash generated from operations in the first three months of 2021, partially offset by the payment of dividends and capital expenditures. Working capital was $9.4 billion at March 31, 2021 and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in working capital in 2021 primarily reflects the increase in cash and cash equivalents partially offset by an increase in the current portion of long-term debt. ​ In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first three months of 2021 totaled $2.6 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion over the prior year primarily due to higher operating earnings, higher collections of accounts receivable and the timing of pension contributions partially offset by higher cash taxes paid. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities was a use of $6 million for the first three months of 2021 and a use of $369 million for the first three months of 2020. The year-over-year change in Other, net in Net cash from operating activities is primarily due to the timing of pension contributions as pension contributions were $16 million in 2021 and $320 million in 2020. Cash taxes paid were approximately $270 million in 2021 and $125 million in 2020. ​ In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. As of March 31, 2021, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion authorization remains available. ​ At March 31, 2021, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was A by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2025. ​ In October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. The 2019 authorization is in addition to the approximately $100 million unused portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2014. ​ On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. No shares have been issued under this authorization. ​ In the first quarter of 2021, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of 25 percent over the $0.36 per share dividend declared in the first quarter of 2020. 21 Table of Contents ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2021. The new standard did not have an impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ Legislative Issues ​ Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​ Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements ​ Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and are incorporated herein by reference. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. ​ ​ 22 Table of Contents PART I.

and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Note 1 — Basis of Presentation ​ The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. ​ Note 2 — New Accounting Standards ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses , which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. ​ Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ​ In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. Abbott does not expect adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ Note 3 — Revenue ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. ​ The following tables provide detail by sales category: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 ​ Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 ​ (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 799 ​ $ 799 ​ $ — ​ $ 891 ​ $ 891 ​ Other ​ — ​ 300 ​ 300 ​ — ​ 321 ​ ​ 321 ​ Total ​ — ​ 1,099 ​ 1,099 ​ — ​ 1,212 ​ 1,212 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 488 ​ 518 ​ 1,006 ​ 478 ​ 566 ​ 1,044 ​ Adult Nutritionals ​ 330 ​ 588 ​ 918 ​ 310 ​ 520 ​ 830 ​ Total ​ 818 ​ 1,106 ​ 1,924 ​ 788 ​ 1,086 ​ 1,874 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 284 ​ 892 ​ 1,176 ​ 272 ​ 905 ​ 1,177 ​ Molecular ​ 220 ​ 238 ​ 458 ​ 35 ​ 76 ​ 111 ​ Point of Care ​ 96 ​ 35 ​ 131 ​ 112 ​ 32 ​ 144 ​ Rapid Diagnostics ​ 533 ​ 342 ​ 875 ​ 283 ​ 194 ​ 477 ​ Total ​ 1,133 ​ 1,507 ​ 2,640 ​ 702 ​ 1,207 ​ 1,909 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 242 ​ 265 ​ 507 ​ 265 ​ 273 ​ 538 ​ Electrophysiology ​ 192 ​ 249 ​ 441 ​ 185 ​ 242 ​ 427 ​ Heart Failure ​ 144 ​ 46 ​ 190 ​ 136 ​ 50 ​ 186 ​ Vascular ​ 230 ​ 400 ​ 630 ​ 251 ​ 446 ​ 697 ​ Structural Heart ​ 159 ​ 194 ​ 353 ​ 158 ​ 190 ​ 348 ​ Neuromodulation ​ 170 ​ 36 ​ 206 ​ 165 ​ 39 ​ 204 ​ Diabetes Care ​ ​ 226 ​ ​ 617 ​ ​ 843 ​ ​ 175 ​ ​ 490 ​ ​ 665 ​ Total ​ 1,363 ​ 1,807 ​ 3,170 ​ 1,335 ​ 1,730 ​ 3,065 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 15 ​ 5 ​ 20 ​ 9 ​ 7 ​ 16 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ $ 3,329 ​ $ 5,524 ​ $ 8,853 ​ $ 2,834 ​ $ 5,242 ​ $ 8,076 ​ ​ 9 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2020 (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 ​ Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 2,376 ​ $ 2,376 ​ $ — ​ $ 2,496 ​ $ 2,496 Other ​ — ​ 780 ​ 780 ​ — ​ 816 ​ ​ 816 Total ​ — ​ 3,156 ​ 3,156 ​ — ​ 3,312 ​ 3,312 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 1,490 ​ 1,629 ​ 3,119 ​ 1,406 ​ 1,718 ​ 3,124 Adult Nutritionals ​ 948 ​ 1,644 ​ 2,592 ​ 915 ​ 1,502 ​ 2,417 Total ​ 2,438 ​ 3,273 ​ 5,711 ​ 2,321 ​ 3,220 ​ 5,541 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 840 ​ 2,312 ​ 3,152 ​ 793 ​ 2,614 ​ 3,407 Molecular ​ 429 ​ 527 ​ 956 ​ 113 ​ 213 ​ 326 Point of Care ​ 278 ​ 109 ​ 387 ​ 334 ​ 90 ​ 424 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 1,246 ​ 719 ​ 1,965 ​ 881 ​ 617 ​ 1,498 Total ​ 2,793 ​ 3,667 ​ 6,460 ​ 2,121 ​ 3,534 ​ 5,655 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 655 ​ 727 ​ 1,382 ​ 790 ​ 810 ​ 1,600 Electrophysiology ​ 476 ​ 652 ​ 1,128 ​ 549 ​ 713 ​ 1,262 Heart Failure ​ 411 ​ 140 ​ 551 ​ 428 ​ 143 ​ 571 Vascular ​ 628 ​ 1,108 ​ 1,736 ​ 787 ​ 1,349 ​ 2,136 Structural Heart ​ 386 ​ 508 ​ 894 ​ 446 ​ 578 ​ 1,024 Neuromodulation ​ 392 ​ 97 ​ 489 ​ 485 ​ 124 ​ 609 Diabetes Care ​ ​ 614 ​ ​ 1,736 ​ ​ 2,350 ​ ​ 485 ​ ​ 1,348 ​ ​ 1,833 Total ​ 3,562 ​ 4,968 ​ 8,530 ​ 3,970 ​ 5,065 ​ 9,035 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 30 ​ 20 ​ 50 ​ 26 ​ 21 ​ 47 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ $ 8,823 ​ $ 15,084 ​ $ 23,907 ​ $ 8,438 ​ $ 15,152 ​ $ 23,590 ​ Remaining Performance Obligations ​ As of September 30, 2020, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 3.6 billion in the Diagnostics segment and approximately $ 430 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months , approximately 18 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. ​ These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. ​ Other Contract Assets and Liabilities ​ Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. ​ Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. ​ Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Contract Liabilities ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 294 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ ​ 350 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ​ ( 293 ) Balance at September 30, 2020 ​ $ 351 ​ ​ 10 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information ​ Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were $ 1.226 billion and $ 954 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were $ 2.302 billion and $ 2.622 billion, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were $ 1.226 billion and $ 954 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were $ 2.322 billion and $ 2.622 billion, respectively. ​ Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2020 include the recognition of $ 20 million of tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to the previous sale of a business that was reported as a discontinued operation. ​ Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first nine months of 2020 includes $ 350 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 700 million. The first nine months of 2019 includes $ 337 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 775 million. ​ The following summarizes the activity for the first nine months of 2020 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of September 30, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 228 Impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 ​ 7 Provisions/charges to income ​ ​ 63 Amounts charged off and other deductions ​ ( 14 ) Balance at September 30, 2020 ​ $ 284 ​ The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. ​ The components of long-term investments as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ September 30, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Long-term Investments ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 755 ​ $ 836 Other ​ 48 ​ 47 Total ​ $ 803 ​ $ 883 ​ Abbott’s long-term investments as of September 30, 2020 declined versus the balance as of December 31, 2019 due to investment impairments totaling approximately $ 110 million, recorded in Other (income) expense, net within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings, which was partially offset by approximately $ 30 million of additional investments during the first nine months of 2020. ​ Abbott's equity securities as of September 30, 2020 include approximately $ 336 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. ​ Abbott also holds certain investments as of September 30, 2020 with a carrying value of approximately $ 292 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $ 112 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The $ 112 million carrying value is net of an approximately $ 60 million impairment of an investment in the second quarter of 2020 for which Abbott had previously recorded an unrealized gain of approximately $ 50 million in 2018. ​ In the first quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc., Abbott acquired a research & development (R&D) asset valued at $ 102 million, which was immediately expensed. The $ 102 million of expense was recorded in the R&D line of Abbott's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. ​ 11 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Note 5 — Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ​ The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended September 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (Losses) on ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Actuarial ​ Derivative ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ (Losses) and Prior ​ Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Service (Costs) ​ Designated as ​ ​ Adjustments ​ and Credits ​ Cash Flow Hedges (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Balance at June 30 ​ $ ( 5,713 ) ​ $ ( 4,699 ) ​ $ ( 3,446 ) ​ $ ( 2,677 ) ​ $ 79 ​ $ 11 Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ 112 ​ ( 478 ) ​ ​ ( 21 ) ​ 7 ​ ( 74 ) ​ 67 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ — ​ 49 ​ 24 ​ ( 30 ) ​ ( 18 ) Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ 112 ​ ( 478 ) ​ 28 ​ 31 ​ ( 104 ) ​ 49 Balance at September 30 ​ $ ( 5,601 ) ​ $ ( 5,177 ) ​ $ ( 3,418 ) ​ $ ( 2,646 ) ​ $ ( 25 ) ​ $ 60 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nine Months Ended September 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (Losses) on ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Actuarial ​ Derivative ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ (Losses) and Prior ​ Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Service (Costs) ​ Designated as ​ ​ Adjustments and Credits Cash Flow Hedges (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Balance at January 1 ​ $ ( 4,924 ) ​ $ ( 4,912 ) ​ $ ( 3,540 ) ​ $ ( 2,726 ) ​ $ ( 1 ) ​ $ 52 Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ( 677 ) ​ ( 265 ) ​ ( 23 ) ​ 9 ​ 35 ​ 48 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ ​ — ​ 145 ​ 71 ​ ( 59 ) ​ ( 40 ) Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ ( 677 ) ​ ( 265 ) ​ 122 ​ 80 ​ ( 24 ) ​ 8 Balance at September 30 ​ $ ( 5,601 ) ​ $ ( 5,177 ) ​ $ ( 3,418 ) ​ $ ( 2,646 ) ​ $ ( 25 ) ​ $ 60 ​ Reclassified amounts for foreign currency translation are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as Net foreign exchange (gain) loss; and amounts for cash flow hedges are recorded as Cost of products sold.

Foreign currency translation adjustments increased goodwill by approximately $ 144 million in the first nine months of 2020. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at September 30, 2020 was $ 2.9 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.7 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.4 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first nine months of 2020. ​ The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $ 27.5 billion as of September 30, 2020 and $ 27.6 billion as of December 31, 2019, and accumulated amortization was $ 13.5 billion as of September 30, 2020 and $ 11.9 billion as of December 31, 2019. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $ 69 million in the first nine months of 2020. An asset impairment related to the Medical Devices segment decreased intangible assets by $ 148 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2020. The impairment was recorded in the Cost of products sold, excluding amortization of intangible assets line of Abbott's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.1 billion in 2020, $ 2.0 billion per year in 2021, 2022 , and 2023 and $ 1.9 billion in 2024. ​ Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process R&D acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.3 billion as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively . ​ Note 7 — Restructuring Plans ​ From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. In the first nine months of 2020, charges of $ 13 million were recognized, of which $ 6 million is recorded in Cost of products sold, $ 1 million is recorded in Research and development and $ 6 million as Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for the first nine months of 2020 related to these actions and the status of the related accrual as of September 30, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 46 Restructuring charges recorded in 2020 ​ ​ 13 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 24 ) Accrued balance at September 30, 2020 ​ $ 35 ​ 12 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2020 (Unaudited) From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. In the first nine months of 2020, charges of $ 29 million were recognized, of which $ 1 million is recorded in Cost of products sold, $ 1 million is recorded in Research and development and $ 27 million as Selling, general and administrative expense.

At September 30, 2020, approximately 113 million common shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2020 is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 29,352,400 ​ 20,764,950 Weighted average remaining life ( years ) 6.2 ​ 5.2 Weighted average exercise price $ 55.34 ​ $ 45.92 Aggregate intrinsic value ( in millions ) $ 1,570 ​ $ 1,306 ​ The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at September 30, 2020 amounted to approximately $ 499 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . ​ Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit ​ On September 28, 2020, Abbott repaid the € 1.140 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.00 % Notes due 2020 upon maturity. The repayment equated to approximately $ 1.3 billion. ​ On June 24, 2020, Abbott completed the issuance of $ 1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $ 650 million of its 1.15 % Notes due 2028 and $ 650 million of its 1.40 % Notes due 2030. ​ On February 24, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $ 500 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.80 % Notes due 2020. ​ ​ Note 10 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures ​ Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 7.9 billion at September 30, 2020 and $ 6.8 billion at December 31, 2019, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of September 30, 2020 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . ​ Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Abbott held the gross notional amount of $ 8.9 billion and $ 9.1 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. ​ Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $ 566 million and $ 546 million as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. ​ Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. ​ 13 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2020 (Unaudited) The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value - Assets ​ Fair Value - Liabilities ​ ​ Sept. 30, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ ​ Sept. 30, ​ Dec. 31, ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 Balance Sheet Caption 2020 2019 Balance Sheet Caption Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ $ 232 $ 48 Deferred income taxes and other assets $ — $ — Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Hedging instruments ​ 89 ​ 110 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 241 ​ 56 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges ​ 37 ​ 38 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 62 ​ 33 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ n/a ​ ​ 566 ​ ​ 546 ​ Long-term debt ​ ​ $ 358 $ 196 ​ ​ $ 869 $ 635 ​ ​ ​ The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gain (loss) Recognized in Other ​ Income (expense) and Gain (loss) ​ ​ ​ ​ Comprehensive Income (loss) ​ Reclassified into Income ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ ​ ​ ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 ​ 2020 2019 2020 2019 ​ 2020 2019 Income Statement Caption Foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges ​ $ 103 ​ $ 99 ​ $ ( 35 ) ​ $ 78 ​ $ 48 ​ $ 26 ​ $ 90 ​ $ 58 ​ Cost of products sold Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ ( 10 ) ​ — ​ ( 20 ) ​ — ​ — ​ — ​ — ​ — n/a Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ ( 11 ) ​ 35 ​ 184 ​ 174 Interest expense ​ Losses of $ 100 million and gains of $ 49 million were recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as a hedge.

The fair value of debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. ​ Note 11 — Litigation and Environmental Matters ​ Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. ​ Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 85 million to $ 120 million. The recorded accrual balance at September 30, 2020 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 105 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ​ Note 12 — Post-Employment Benefits ​ Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized in continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined Benefit Plans ​ Medical and Dental Plans ​ ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ ​ Ended September 30 ​ Ended September 30 ​ Ended September 30 ​ Ended September 30 (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Service cost — benefits earned during the period ​ $ 85 ​ $ 63 ​ $ 251 ​ $ 188 ​ $ 12 ​ $ 5 ​ $ 35 ​ $ 17 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations ​ 75 ​ 84 ​ 224 ​ 253 ​ 11 ​ 13 ​ 32 ​ 39 Expected return on plan assets ​ ( 193 ) ​ ( 177 ) ​ ( 576 ) ​ ( 533 ) ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 6 ) ​ ( 21 ) ​ ( 20 ) Net amortization of: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Actuarial loss, net ​ ​ 64 ​ ​ 33 ​ ​ 191 ​ ​ 99 ​ ​ 5 ​ ​ 6 ​ ​ 15 ​ ​ 17 Prior service cost (credit) ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ 1 ​ ​ 1 ​ ​ ( 7 ) ​ ​ ( 8 ) ​ ​ ( 21 ) ​ ​ ( 24 ) Net cost - continuing operations ​ $ 31 ​ $ 3 ​ $ 91 ​ $ 8 ​ $ 14 ​ $ 10 ​ $ 40 ​ $ 29 ​ 15 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to Internal Revenue Service funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first nine months of 2020 and 2019, $ 350 million and $ 337 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans and $ 11 million was contributed to the post-employment medical and dental plans in each year. ​ Note 13 — Taxes on Earnings ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first nine months of 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $ 81 million in tax benefits related to the settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group’s 2014 through 2016 federal income tax returns in the U.S. and $ 87 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2020 reflect the recognition of $ 20 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In the first nine months of 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include a $ 78 million reduction to the transition tax related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and approximately $ 95 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The $ 78 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in the first quarter of 2019. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $ 70 million and $ 410 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2015. ​ Note 14 — Segment Information ​ Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world. ​ Abbott’s reportable segments are as follows: ​ Established Pharmaceutical Products — International sales of a broad line of branded generic pharmaceutical products. ​ Nutritional Products — Worldwide sales of a broad line of adult and pediatric nutritional products. ​ Diagnostic Products — Worldwide sales of diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, physician offices and alternate-care testing sites. For segment reporting purposes, the Core Laboratory Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics divisions are aggregated and reported as the Diagnostic Products segment. ​ Medical Devices — Worldwide sales of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care products. For segment reporting purposes, the Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure, Vascular, Neuromodulation, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care divisions are aggregated and reported as the Medical Devices segment. ​ Abbott’s underlying accounting records are maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting requirements. Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. Intersegment transfers of inventory are recorded at standard cost and are not a measure of segment operating earnings. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment’s assets. ​ 16 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2020 (Unaudited) The following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Sales to External Customers ​ Operating Earnings ​ ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ ​ Ended September 30 ​ Ended September 30 ​ Ended September 30 ​ Ended September 30 (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Established Pharmaceutical Products ​ $ 1,099 ​ $ 1,212 ​ $ 3,156 ​ $ 3,312 ​ $ 201 ​ $ 281 ​ $ 588 ​ $ 654 Nutritional Products ​ 1,924 ​ 1,874 ​ 5,711 ​ 5,541 ​ 394 ​ 414 ​ 1,327 ​ 1,241 Diagnostic Products ​ 2,640 ​ 1,909 ​ 6,460 ​ 5,655 ​ 875 ​ 456 ​ 1,802 ​ 1,356 Medical Devices ​ 3,170 ​ 3,065 ​ 8,530 ​ 9,035 ​ 928 ​ 958 ​ 2,122 ​ 2,722 Total Reportable Segments ​ 8,833 ​ 8,060 ​ 23,857 ​ 23,543 ​ 2,398 ​ 2,109 ​ 5,839 ​ ​ 5,973 Other ​ 20 ​ 16 ​ 50 ​ 47 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net sales ​ $ 8,853 ​ $ 8,076 ​ $ 23,907 ​ $ 23,590 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Corporate functions and benefit plan costs ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 129 ) ​ ​ ( 131 ) ​ ​ ( 367 ) ​ ​ ( 332 ) Net interest expense ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 127 ) ​ ​ ( 143 ) ​ ​ ( 373 ) ​ ​ ( 437 ) Share-based compensation (a) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 100 ) ​ ​ ( 94 ) ​ ​ ( 448 ) ​ ​ ( 434 ) Amortization of intangible assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 510 ) ​ ​ ( 484 ) ​ ​ ( 1,624 ) ​ ​ ( 1,453 ) Other, net (b) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 111 ) ​ ​ ( 154 ) ​ ​ ( 447 ) ​ ​ ( 480 ) Earnings from continuing operations before taxes ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 1,421 ​ $ 1,103 ​ $ 2,580 ​ $ 2,837 ​ ​ 17 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ​ Financial Review - Results of Operations ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. ​ During the first nine months of 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected Abbott’s diversified health care businesses in various ways. As is further described below, some businesses have performed at the levels required to successfully meet new demands, others have faced challenges, and still others have been relatively stable. Beginning in February, cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures and routine core laboratory diagnostic testing volumes declined in China as that country implemented quarantine restrictions and postponed non-emergency health care activities. As March progressed, procedures and routine testing volumes in China steadily improved from the low levels seen in February. ​ As COVID-19 spread geographically, the impact initially expanded to certain countries in Asia and Europe beginning in late February, and more broadly across Europe and the U.S. during March and April. As the health care systems in these countries shifted their focus to fighting COVID-19, the impact on cardiovascular and neuromodulation device procedures and routine diagnostic testing volumes was similar to what was experienced in China in February. COVID-19 affected developed markets most significantly in the second quarter and expanded into key emerging markets in the third quarter. As a result, as is further described below, some businesses slowed and sales of cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices and routine diagnostic tests declined during the first nine months of 2020 from the prior year. Encouragingly, routine testing and procedure volume improved across Abbott’s hospital-based businesses as the second quarter progressed and the improvement continued in the third quarter as both demand for procedures and availability of health care resources return to more normal levels. ​ Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch nine new diagnostic tests for COVID-19: ​ ​ During the first nine months of 2020, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing related sales totaled $1.533 billion, of which $881 million was generated in the third quarter of 2020. ​ Abbott is continually implementing business continuity plans in the face of the pandemic. Due to the critical nature of its products and services, Abbott was generally exempt from governmental orders issued during the first quarter of 2020 in the U.S. and other countries requiring businesses to cease operations. The majority of its office-based work was conducted remotely during the period of such governmental orders and the company implemented strict travel restrictions. As some governmental orders were lifted in May and June 2020, Abbott entered a new phase in its operations whereby some office-based employees started working at Abbott’s offices on a rotational basis. Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees. ​ With respect to Abbott’s financial position, at September 30, 2020, Abbott’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled approximately $4.7 billion compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Existing credit agreements are in place that would provide additional access to $5 billion, if needed. ​ Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. ​ 18 Table of Contents The following table details sales by reportable segment for the three and nine months ended September 30.

Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates during the period compared to the third quarter of 2019. The relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 1.6 percent and total sales by 1.0 percent in the third quarter of 2020. ​ The 3.2 percent increase in total net sales during the first nine months of 2020, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was driven by increases in the Diagnostics and Nutritional Products segments, partially offset by a decrease in the Medical Devices segment due to reduced procedure volumes as a result of the pandemic. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first nine months of 2020 as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 2.8 percent and total sales by 1.9 percent. ​ 19 Table of Contents The table below provides detail by sales category for the nine months ended September 30.

Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in the Key Emerging Markets increased 3.2 percent compared to the first nine months of 2019 led primarily by growth in China and various countries in Asia and Latin America. The nine-month growth rate was negatively impacted by lower demand in the second and third quarters of 2020 due to the spread of COVID-19 across emerging market countries. Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased by 4.3 percent in the first nine months of 2020. ​ International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 2.7 percent in the first nine months of 2020 versus the comparable 2019 period. Growth across Abbott’s pediatric products in various countries in Southeast Asia was more than offset by challenging market dynamics in the Greater China infant category. U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales increased 5.9 percent primarily due to increased demand for Pedialyte ® , Abbott’s oral rehydration brand, and Pediasure ® . The 13.0 percent increase in International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects continued growth of the Ensure ® and Glucerna ® brands in several countries. U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 3.7 percent due to growth in Ensure. ​ In the Diagnostics segment, Core Laboratory sales decreased 5.7 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, as the lower volume of routine testing performed in hospital and other laboratories due to COVID-19 was partially offset by sales of Abbott’s COVID-19 laboratory-based tests for the detection of the IgG and IgM antibodies, which determine if someone was previously infected with the virus. Core Laboratory antibody testing-related sales on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were $212 million in the first nine months of 2020. The 196.2 percent increase in Molecular Diagnostics sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects higher volumes due to demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 on its m 2000 and Alinity m platforms. Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $672 million in the first nine months of 2020. ​ In Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 31.9 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to strong demand for Abbott’s point-of-care COVID-19 molecular test on its ID NOW platform and its BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card test in the U.S. as well as international demand for COVID-19 rapid tests on its Panbio system and increased testing in the first quarter for the flu in the U.S. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on routine diagnostic testing. Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $649 million in the first nine months of 2020. ​ Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales decreased 5.0 percent; the decrease was driven by the impact of COVID-19 on Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses, partially offset by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care. Growth in Diabetes Care sales was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, internationally and in the U.S. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $1.880 billion in the first nine months of 2020, which reflected a 44.8 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over the first nine months of 2019 when FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $1.308 billion. ​ In June, Abbott announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of FreeStyle Libre 2 as an integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) system for adults and children ages 4 and older with diabetes. In September, Abbott obtained CE Mark for its FreeStyle Libre 3 system, which automatically delivers real time, up-to-the-minute glucose readings, 14-day accuracy and real-time glucose alarms. Abbott also obtained CE Mark for its Libre Sense™ Glucose Sport Biosensor in Europe. Libre Sense is a consumer over-the-counter product that provides continuous glucose monitoring for athletes to better understand the efficacy of their nutrition choices on training and athletic performance. 20 Table of Contents ​ In Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses, revenues during the first nine months of 2020 were negatively impacted by reduced procedure volumes due to COVID-19. Procedure volume trends improved over the course of the second and third quarters as both demand for procedures and availability of healthcare resources return to more normal levels. In April, Abbott announced CE Mark approval for its TriClip ® heart valve repair system, the world’s first minimally invasive, clip-based tricuspid heart valve repair device. In July, Abbott announced U.S. FDA approval of its next-generation Gallant™ implantable cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices to help manage heart rhythm disorders. These devices offer Bluetooth technology and a new patient smartphone app for improved remote monitoring and enhanced patient-physician engagement. In September, Abbott obtained CE Mark for MitraClip ® G4, its next-generation MitraClip mitral valve repair device. ​ In April 2017, Abbott received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA related to its manufacturing facility in Sylmar, CA which was acquired by Abbott on January 4, 2017 as part of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. This facility manufactures implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, and monitors. Abbott prepared and executed a comprehensive plan of corrective actions. On April 28, 2020, Abbott received a letter from the FDA indicating that, based on the FDA’s evaluation, it appeared that Abbott had addressed the items in the warning letter. As a result, the warning letter is considered closed. ​ The gross profit margin percentage was 49.4 percent for the third quarter of 2020 compared to 52.4 percent for the third quarter of 2019. The gross profit margin percentage was 49.2 percent for the first nine months of 2020 compared to 52.3 percent for the first nine months of 2019. The decreases in the gross profit margin percentage primarily reflect the mix of sales across Abbott’s various businesses and operational inefficiencies due to the impact of COVID-19, as well as the increase in intangible asset amortization, the impairment of an intangible asset and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on gross margin in 2020. ​ Research and development (R&D) expenses decreased $16 million, or 2.8 percent, in the third quarter of 2020 and decreased $123 million, or 6.7 percent, in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the prior year. The decrease in the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflects lower integration and restructuring costs in 2020 related to R&D. The decrease in R&D spending in the first nine months of 2020 primarily reflects the immediate expensing in the first quarter of 2019 of an R&D asset valued at $102 million in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc. The decrease in R&D expense during the first nine months of 2020 also reflects the favorable effect of foreign exchange in 2020. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, research and development expenditures totaled $921 million for the Medical Devices segment, $419 million for the Diagnostic Products segment, $137 million for the Nutritional Products segment and $127 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. ​ Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 5.7 percent in the third quarter and decreased 3.1 percent in the first nine months of 2020. The decreases in the quarter and the first nine months of 2020 are due to income of $100 million from a litigation settlement in 2020, the favorable effect of foreign exchange, lower spending due to COVID-19 mobility restrictions, and the impact of various cost saving initiatives, partially offset by higher spending to drive growth in various businesses. ​ Restructuring Plans ​ The results for the first nine months of 2020 reflect charges under approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere or as part of various cost reduction programs. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $42 million in the first nine months of 2020 related to these initiatives, of which $7 million is recognized in Cost of products sold, $2 million is recognized in Research and development and $33 million is recognized in SG&A. See Note 7 to the financial statements, “Restructuring Plans,” for additional information regarding these charges. ​ Other (Income) Expense, net ​ Other (income) expense, net totaled $46 million of income in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $55 million of income in 2019 and $25 million of income in the first nine months of 2020 compared to $140 million of income in 2019. The change in Other (income) expense, net for the first nine months of 2020 primarily reflects equity investment impairments that totaled approximately $110 million in the first nine months of 2020. ​ Interest Expense, net ​ Interest expense, net decreased $16 million in the third quarter of 2020 and $64 million in the first nine months of 2020 due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in November of 2019, the repayment of debt in December 2019 and a lower interest rate environment in 2020. ​ Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first nine months of 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $81 million in tax benefits related to the settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group’s 2014 through 2016 federal income tax returns in the U.S. and $87 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2020 reflect the recognition of $20 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In the first nine months of 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include a $78 million reduction to the transition tax related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and approximately $95 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The $78 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in the first quarter of 2019. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $70 million and $410 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In the U.S., Abbott's federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2015. ​ 21 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources September 30, 2020 Compared with December 31, 2019 ​ On September 28, 2020, Abbott repaid the €1.140 billion outstanding principal amount of its 0.00% Notes due 2020 upon maturity. The debt repayment, which equated to approximately $1.3 billion, was primarily funded by the net proceeds from the issuance on June 24, 2020 of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The June 2020 issuance consisted of $650 million of 1.15% Notes due 2028 and $650 million of 1.40% Notes due 2030. ​ The $620 million increase in cash and cash equivalents from $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019 to $4.5 billion at September 30, 2020 primarily reflects the favorable impact of cash generated by operating activities, partially offset by the payment of dividends and capital expenditures. Working capital was $7.1 billion at September 30, 2020 and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The $2.3 billion increase was due in large part to the higher level of cash and cash equivalents noted above, as well as an increase in inventory related to shifting demand dynamics and higher accounts receivable balances due to higher levels of sales. ​ In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months of 2020 totaled $4.1 billion, an increase of $383 million over the prior year due primarily to lower payments related to integration expenses, restructuring actions and interest, the proceeds from a litigation settlement payment and timing for various accrued expenses, partially offset by an increased investment in working capital. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months of 2020 was a source of $42 million and includes the impact of non-cash impairment charges related to intangible assets and equity investments and the payment timing for various accrued expenses partially offset by the impact of the payment of cash taxes of approximately $700 million and $350 million of pension contributions. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months of 2019 was a use of $523 million and includes the payment of cash taxes of approximately $775 million and $337 million of pension contributions, partially offset by payment timing for various accrued expenses. Abbott expects to fund cash dividends, capital expenditures and its other investments in its businesses with cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand, short-term investments and borrowings. ​ In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. This bond redemption authorization superseded the board’s previous authorization under which $700 million had not yet been redeemed. In December 2019, Abbott redeemed $2.850 billion of debt. After this redemption, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion debt redemption authorization remains available. ​ At September 30, 2020, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was A- by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2023. ​ In October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. This authorization is in addition to the $270 million unused portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2014. ​ On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. No shares have been issued under this authorization. ​ In each of the first three quarters of 2020, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of approximately 12.5 percent over the $0.32 per share quarterly dividend declared in each of the first three quarters of 2019. ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses , which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. ​ Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ​ In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. Abbott does not expect adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ Legislative Issues ​ Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​ Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements ​ Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott's operations and financial results, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors'', in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. ​ 22 Table of Contents PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures ​ (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert B. Ford, and Chief Financial Officer, Robert E. Funck, Jr., evaluated the effectiveness of Abbott Laboratories’ disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that Abbott Laboratories’ disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information Abbott is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Abbott in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Abbott’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. ​ ​ PART II.

Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Note 1 — Basis of Presentation ​ The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. ​ Note 2 — New Accounting Standards ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses , which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. ​ Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ​ In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. Abbott does not expect adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ Note 3 — Revenue ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. ​ The following tables provide detail by sales category: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 ​ Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 764 ​ $ 764 ​ $ — ​ $ 853 ​ $ 853 Other ​ — ​ 249 ​ 249 ​ — ​ 255 ​ ​ 255 Total ​ — ​ 1,013 ​ 1,013 ​ — ​ 1,108 ​ 1,108 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 484 ​ 540 ​ 1,024 ​ 475 ​ 576 ​ 1,051 Adult Nutritionals ​ 324 ​ 535 ​ 859 ​ 311 ​ 513 ​ 824 Total ​ 808 ​ 1,075 ​ 1,883 ​ 786 ​ 1,089 ​ 1,875 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 289 ​ 698 ​ 987 ​ 272 ​ 897 ​ 1,169 Molecular ​ 144 ​ 215 ​ 359 ​ 38 ​ 69 ​ 107 Point of Care ​ 79 ​ 39 ​ 118 ​ 113 ​ 32 ​ 145 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 345 ​ 185 ​ 530 ​ 272 ​ 212 ​ 484 Total ​ 857 ​ 1,137 ​ 1,994 ​ 695 ​ 1,210 ​ 1,905 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 185 ​ 216 ​ 401 ​ 273 ​ 275 ​ 548 Electrophysiology ​ 120 ​ 179 ​ 299 ​ 190 ​ 240 ​ 430 Heart Failure ​ 115 ​ 43 ​ 158 ​ 149 ​ 52 ​ 201 Vascular ​ 168 ​ 313 ​ 481 ​ 270 ​ 460 ​ 730 Structural Heart ​ 91 ​ 132 ​ 223 ​ 152 ​ 200 ​ 352 Neuromodulation ​ 85 ​ 21 ​ 106 ​ 168 ​ 44 ​ 212 Diabetes Care ​ ​ 202 ​ ​ 553 ​ ​ 755 ​ ​ 158 ​ ​ 444 ​ ​ 602 Total ​ 966 ​ 1,457 ​ 2,423 ​ 1,360 ​ 1,715 ​ 3,075 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 7 ​ 8 ​ 15 ​ 9 ​ 7 ​ 16 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ $ 2,638 ​ $ 4,690 ​ $ 7,328 ​ $ 2,850 ​ $ 5,129 ​ $ 7,979 ​ ​ 9 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2020 (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 ​ Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 1,577 ​ $ 1,577 ​ $ — ​ $ 1,605 ​ $ 1,605 Other ​ — ​ 480 ​ 480 ​ — ​ 495 ​ ​ 495 Total ​ — ​ 2,057 ​ 2,057 ​ — ​ 2,100 ​ 2,100 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 1,002 ​ 1,111 ​ 2,113 ​ 928 ​ 1,152 ​ 2,080 Adult Nutritionals ​ 618 ​ 1,056 ​ 1,674 ​ 605 ​ 982 ​ 1,587 Total ​ 1,620 ​ 2,167 ​ 3,787 ​ 1,533 ​ 2,134 ​ 3,667 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 556 ​ 1,420 ​ 1,976 ​ 521 ​ 1,709 ​ 2,230 Molecular ​ 209 ​ 289 ​ 498 ​ 78 ​ 137 ​ 215 Point of Care ​ 182 ​ 74 ​ 256 ​ 222 ​ 58 ​ 280 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 713 ​ 377 ​ 1,090 ​ 598 ​ 423 ​ 1,021 Total ​ 1,660 ​ 2,160 ​ 3,820 ​ 1,419 ​ 2,327 ​ 3,746 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 413 ​ 462 ​ 875 ​ 525 ​ 537 ​ 1,062 Electrophysiology ​ 284 ​ 403 ​ 687 ​ 364 ​ 471 ​ 835 Heart Failure ​ 267 ​ 94 ​ 361 ​ 292 ​ 93 ​ 385 Vascular ​ 398 ​ 708 ​ 1,106 ​ 536 ​ 903 ​ 1,439 Structural Heart ​ 227 ​ 314 ​ 541 ​ 288 ​ 388 ​ 676 Neuromodulation ​ 222 ​ 61 ​ 283 ​ 320 ​ 85 ​ 405 Diabetes Care ​ ​ 388 ​ ​ 1,119 ​ ​ 1,507 ​ ​ 310 ​ ​ 858 ​ ​ 1,168 Total ​ 2,199 ​ 3,161 ​ 5,360 ​ 2,635 ​ 3,335 ​ 5,970 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 15 ​ 15 ​ 30 ​ 17 ​ 14 ​ 31 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Total ​ $ 5,494 ​ $ 9,560 ​ $ 15,054 ​ $ 5,604 ​ $ 9,910 ​ $ 15,514 ​ Remaining Performance Obligations ​ As of June 30, 2020, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 3.5 billion in the Diagnostics segment and approximately $ 415 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months , approximately 17 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. ​ These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. ​ Other Contract Assets and Liabilities ​ Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. ​ Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. ​ Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Contract Liabilities ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 294 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ 233 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ( 192 ) Balance at June 30, 2020 ​ $ 335 ​ ​ 10 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information ​ Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were $ 534 million and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were $ 1.075 billion and $ 1.668 billion, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were $ 534 million and $ 1.0 billion, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were $ 1.095 billion and $ 1.668 billion, respectively. ​ Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first six months of 2020 includes $ 335 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 285 million. The first six months of 2019 includes $ 326 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 615 million. ​ Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first six months of 2020 include the recognition of $ 20 million of tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to the previous sale of a business that was reported as a discontinued operation. ​ The following summarizes the activity for the first six months of 2020 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of June 30, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 228 Impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 ​ 7 Provisions/charges to income ​ ​ 45 Amounts charged off and other deductions ​ ( 14 ) Balance at June 30, 2020 ​ $ 266 ​ The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivables. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. ​ The components of long-term investments as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Long-term Investments ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 728 ​ $ 836 Other ​ ​ 48 ​ ​ 47 Total $ 776 $ 883 ​ Abbott’s long-term investments as of June 30, 2020, declined versus the balance as of December 31, 2019, due to investment impairments totaling approximately $ 110 million, which were recorded in Other (income) expense, net within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. ​ Abbott's equity securities as of June 30, 2020, include approximately $ 328 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. ​ Abbott also holds certain investments as of June 30, 2020 with a carrying value of approximately $ 283 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $ 102 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The $ 102 million carrying value is net of an approximately $ 60 million impairment of an investment in the second quarter of 2020 for which Abbott had previously recorded an unrealized gain of approximately $ 50 million in 2018. ​ In the first quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc., Abbott acquired a research & development (R&D) asset valued at $ 102 million, which was immediately expensed. The $ 102 million of expense was recorded in the R&D line of Abbott's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. ​ 11 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Note 5 — Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ​ The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended June 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (Losses) on ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Actuarial ​ Derivative ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ (Losses) and Prior ​ Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Service (Costs) ​ Designated as ​ ​ Adjustments ​ and Credits ​ Cash Flow Hedges (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Balance at March 31 ​ $ ( 6,068 ) ​ $ ( 4,790 ) ​ $ ( 3,483 ) ​ $ ( 2,703 ) ​ $ 165 ​ $ 23 Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ 355 ​ 91 ​ ​ ( 9 ) ​ 3 ​ ( 67 ) ​ ( 2 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ — ​ 46 ​ 23 ​ ( 19 ) ​ ( 10 ) Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ 355 ​ 91 ​ 37 ​ 26 ​ ( 86 ) ​ ( 12 ) Balance at June 30 ​ $ ( 5,713 ) ​ $ ( 4,699 ) ​ $ ( 3,446 ) ​ $ ( 2,677 ) ​ $ 79 ​ $ 11 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Six Months Ended June 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (Losses) on ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Actuarial ​ Derivative ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ (Losses) and Prior ​ Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Service (Costs) ​ Designated as ​ ​ Adjustments and Credits Cash Flow Hedges (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Balance at January 1 ​ $ ( 4,924 ) ​ $ ( 4,912 ) ​ $ ( 3,540 ) ​ $ ( 2,726 ) ​ $ ( 1 ) ​ $ 52 Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ( 789 ) ​ 213 ​ ( 2 ) ​ 2 ​ 109 ​ ( 19 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ ​ — ​ 96 ​ 47 ​ ( 29 ) ​ ( 22 ) Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ ( 789 ) ​ 213 ​ 94 ​ 49 ​ 80 ​ ( 41 ) Balance at June 30 ​ $ ( 5,713 ) ​ $ ( 4,699 ) ​ $ ( 3,446 ) ​ $ ( 2,677 ) ​ $ 79 ​ $ 11 ​ Reclassified amounts for foreign currency translation are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as Net foreign exchange (gain) loss; and amounts for cash flow hedges are recorded as Cost of products sold. Net actuarial losses and prior service cost are included as a component of net periodic benefit costs; see Note 12 for additional details. ​ Note 6 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets ​ The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 23.1 billion at June 30, 2020 and $ 23.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $ 111 million in the first six months of 2020. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at June 30, 2020 was $ 2.9 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.7 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.2 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first six months of 2020. ​ The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $ 27.5 billion as of June 30, 2020 and $ 27.6 billion as of December 31, 2019, and accumulated amortization was $ 12.9 billion as of June 30, 2020 and $ 11.9 billion as of December 31, 2019. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $ 150 million for the first six months of 2020. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.1 billion in 2020, $ 2.0 billion in 2021, 2022 , and 2023 and $ 1.9 billion in 2024. ​ Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process R&D acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.3 billion as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively . ​ Note 7 — Restructuring Plans ​ From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. In the first six months of 2020, charges of $ 10 million were recognized, of which $ 3 million is recorded in Cost of products sold, $ 1 million is recorded in Research and development and $ 6 million as Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for the first six months of 2020 related to these actions and the status of the related accrual as of June 30, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 46 Restructuring charges recorded in 2020 ​ ​ 10 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 20 ) Accrued balance at June 30, 2020 ​ $ 36 ​ ​ 12 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2020 (Unaudited) From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. In the first six months of 2020, charges of $ 23 million were recognized, of which $ 1 million is recorded in Cost of products sold, $ 1 million is recorded in Research and development and $ 21 million as Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for the first six months of 2020 related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accrual as of June 30, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 79 Restructuring charges recorded in 2020 ​ ​ 23 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 18 ) Accrued balance at June 30, 2020 ​ $ 84 ​ ​ Note 8 — Incentive Stock Programs ​ In the first six months of 2020, Abbott granted 4,006,336 stock options, 568,471 restricted stock awards and 5,143,501 restricted stock units under its current incentive stock program. At June 30, 2020, approximately 113 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2020 is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 30,771,662 ​ 21,898,193 Weighted average remaining life ( years ) 6.4 ​ 5.4 Weighted average exercise price $ 54.61 ​ $ 45.34 Aggregate intrinsic value ( in millions ) $ 1,133 ​ $ 1,009 ​ The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at June 30, 2020 amounted to approximately $ 594 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . ​ Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit ​ On June 24, 2020, Abbott completed the issuance of $ 1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $ 650 million of its 1.15 % Notes due 2028 and $ 650 million of its 1.40 % Notes due 2030. ​ On February 24, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $ 500 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.80 % Notes due 2020. ​ ​ Note 10 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures ​ Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 7.4 billion at June 30, 2020 and $ 6.8 billion at December 31, 2019 are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of June 30, 2020 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . ​ Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Abbott held the gross notional amount of $ 9.2 billion and $ 9.1 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. ​ Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $ 556 million and $ 546 million as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. ​ Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. ​ ​ 13 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2020 (Unaudited) The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value - Assets ​ Fair Value - Liabilities ​ ​ June 30, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ ​ June 30, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 Balance Sheet Caption 2020 2019 Balance Sheet Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 243 $ 48 Deferred income taxes and other assets $ — $ — Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Hedging instruments ​ 117 ​ 110 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 74 ​ 56 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges ​ 53 ​ 38 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 31 ​ 33 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ n/a ​ ​ 556 ​ ​ 546 ​ Long-term debt ​ $ 413 $ 196 ​ ​ $ 661 $ 635 ​ ​ ​ The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gain (loss) Recognized in Other ​ Income (expense) and Gain (loss) ​ ​ ​ ​ Comprehensive Income (loss) ​ Reclassified into Income ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ ​ ​ ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Income Statement Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges ​ $ ( 89 ) ​ $ ( 2 ) ​ $ 138 ​ $ ( 21 ) ​ $ 31 ​ $ 17 ​ $ 42 ​ $ 32 ​ Cost of products sold ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ ​ ( 2 ) ​ ​ — ​ ​ ( 10 ) ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ n/a ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ ​ n/a ​ ​ n/a ​ 27 ​ 96 ​ ​ 195 ​ ​ 139 ​ Interest expense ​ Gains of $ 67 million and $ 26 million were recognized in the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as a hedge.

Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. ​ Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 85 million to $ 120 million. The recorded accrual balance at June 30, 2020 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 105 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ​ Note 12 — Post-Employment Benefits ​ Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized in continuing operations for the three and six months ended June 30 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined Benefit Plans ​ Medical and Dental Plans ​ ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Service cost - benefits earned during the period ​ $ 81 ​ $ 61 ​ $ 166 ​ $ 125 ​ $ 11 ​ $ 6 ​ $ 23 ​ $ 12 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations ​ 74 ​ 85 ​ 149 ​ 169 ​ 9 ​ 13 ​ 21 ​ 26 Expected return on plan assets ​ ( 191 ) ​ ( 178 ) ​ ( 383 ) ​ ( 356 ) ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 14 ) ​ ( 14 ) Net amortization of: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Actuarial loss, net ​ 64 ​ 33 ​ 127 ​ 66 ​ 2 ​ 5 ​ 10 ​ 11 Prior service cost (credit) ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 8 ) ​ ( 14 ) ​ ( 16 ) Net cost - continuing operations ​ $ 29 ​ $ 2 ​ $ 60 ​ $ 5 ​ $ 8 ​ $ 9 ​ $ 26 ​ $ 19 ​ 15 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2020 (Unaudited) Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to IRS funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first six months of 2020 and 2019, $ 335 million and $ 326 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans and $ 11 million was contributed to the post-employment medical and dental plans in each year. ​ Note 13 — Taxes on Earnings ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first six months of 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $ 81 million in tax benefits related to the settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group’s 2014 through 2016 federal income tax returns in the U.S. and $ 67 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first six months of 2020 reflect the recognition of $ 20 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In the first six months of 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include a $ 78 million reduction to the transition tax related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and approximately $ 90 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The $ 78 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in the first quarter of 2019. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $ 70 million and $ 410 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2015. ​ Note 14 — Segment Information ​ Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.

Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment’s assets. ​ 16 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2020 (Unaudited) The following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Sales to External Customers ​ Operating Earnings ​ ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Established Pharmaceutical Products ​ $ 1,013 ​ $ 1,108 ​ $ 2,057 ​ $ 2,100 ​ $ 206 ​ $ 214 ​ $ 387 ​ $ 373 Nutritional Products ​ 1,883 ​ 1,875 ​ 3,787 ​ 3,667 ​ 474 ​ 447 ​ 933 ​ 827 Diagnostic Products ​ 1,994 ​ 1,905 ​ 3,820 ​ 3,746 ​ 522 ​ 466 ​ 927 ​ 900 Medical Devices ​ 2,423 ​ 3,075 ​ 5,360 ​ 5,970 ​ 391 ​ 917 ​ 1,194 ​ 1,764 Total Reportable Segments ​ 7,313 ​ 7,963 ​ 15,024 ​ 15,483 ​ 1,593 ​ 2,044 ​ 3,441 ​ ​ 3,864 Other ​ 15 ​ 16 ​ 30 ​ 31 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net sales ​ $ 7,328 ​ $ 7,979 ​ $ 15,054 ​ $ 15,514 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Corporate functions and benefit plan costs ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 106 ) ​ ​ ( 99 ) ​ ​ ( 238 ) ​ ​ ( 201 ) Net interest expense ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 125 ) ​ ​ ( 146 ) ​ ​ ( 246 ) ​ ​ ( 294 ) Share-based compensation (a) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 115 ) ​ ​ ( 114 ) ​ ​ ( 348 ) ​ ​ ( 340 ) Amortization of intangible assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 553 ) ​ ​ ( 483 ) ​ ​ ( 1,114 ) ​ ​ ( 969 ) Other, net (b) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 168 ) ​ ​ ( 100 ) ​ ​ ( 336 ) ​ ​ ( 326 ) Earnings from continuing operations before taxes ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 526 ​ $ 1,102 ​ $ 1,159 ​ $ 1,734 ​ ​ 17 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ​ Financial Review - Results of Operations ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. ​ During the first six months of 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected Abbott’s diversified health care businesses in various ways. As is further described below, some businesses faced challenges, others have been relatively stable, and still others are performing at the levels required to successfully meet new demands. Beginning in February, cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures and routine core laboratory diagnostic testing volumes declined in China as that country implemented quarantine restrictions and postponed non-emergency health care activities. As March progressed, procedures and routine testing volumes in China steadily improved from the low levels seen in February. ​ As COVID-19 spread geographically, the impact initially expanded to certain countries in Asia and Europe beginning in late February, and more broadly across Europe and the U.S. during March and April. As the health care systems in these countries shifted their focus to fighting COVID-19, the impact on cardiovascular and neuromodulation device procedures and routine diagnostic testing volumes was similar to what was experienced in China in February. As a result, as is further described below, sales of cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices and routine diagnostic tests declined during the first six months of 2020 from the prior year. Encouragingly, routine testing and procedure volume improved across Abbott’s hospital-based businesses as the second quarter progressed as both demand for procedures and availability of health care resources began to return to more normal levels. ​ Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch six new diagnostic tests for COVID-19: ​ ​ During the first six months of 2020, Abbott’s COVID-19 testing related sales totaled $652 million, of which the vast majority were generated in the second quarter of 2020. ​ Abbott is continually implementing business continuity plans in the face of the pandemic. Due to the critical nature of its products and services, Abbott was generally exempt from governmental orders issued during the first quarter of 2020 in the U.S. and other countries requiring businesses to cease operations. The majority of its office-based work was conducted remotely during the period of such governmental orders and the company implemented strict travel restrictions. As governmental orders were lifted in May and June 2020, Abbott entered a new phase in its operations whereby some office-based employees started working at Abbott’s offices on a rotational basis. Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of its facilities for employees working to continue to supply healthcare products to hospital and other customers. ​ With respect to Abbott’s financial position, at June 30, 2020, Abbott’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled approximately $5.0 billion compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase includes the impact of a $1.3 billion bond offering that was completed in June 2020. Existing credit agreements are in place that would provide additional access to $5 billion, if needed. ​ Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. ​ 18 Table of Contents The following table details sales by reportable segment for the three and six months ended June 30.

Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates during the period compared to the second quarter of 2019. The relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 4.4 percent and total sales by 2.8 percent in the second quarter of 2020. ​ The 0.7 percent decrease in total net sales during the first six months of 2020, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was driven by a decrease in the Medical Devices segment due to reduced procedure volumes as a result of the pandemic. The decrease in the Medical Devices segment was mostly offset by growth in the Nutritional Products, Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals segments. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first six months of 2020 as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 3.5 percent and total sales by 2.3 percent. ​ 19 Table of Contents The table below provides detail by sales category for the six months ended June 30.

Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in the Key Emerging Markets increased 5.9 percent compared to the first six months of 2019 led primarily by growth in China, Russia, India and various countries in Latin America. The six-month growth rate was negatively impacted by lower demand in the second quarter of 2020 due to the increased spread of COVID-19 across several emerging market countries. Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased by 2.1 percent in the first six months of 2020. 20 Table of Contents International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased 1.0 percent in the first six months of 2020 versus the comparable 2019 period. Growth across Abbott’s pediatric products in various countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America was more than offset by challenging market dynamics in the Greater China infant category. U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales increased 8.0 percent primarily due to increased demand for Pedialyte ® , Abbott’s oral rehydration brand. The 11.5 percent increase in International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects continued growth of the Glucerna ® and Ensure ® brands in several countries. U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased 2.2 percent primarily due to growth in Ensure. ​ In the Diagnostics segment, Core Laboratory sales decreased 9.2 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, as the lower volume of routine testing performed in hospital and other laboratories due to COVID-19 was partially offset by sales of Abbott’s COVID-19 laboratory-based tests for the detection of the IgG antibody, which determines if someone was previously infected with the virus. Core Laboratory IgG antibody testing-related sales on Abbott’s ARCHITECT and Alinity i platforms were $152 million in the first six months of 2020. The 135.7 percent increase in Molecular Diagnostics sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects higher volumes due to demand for Abbott’s laboratory-based molecular tests for COVID-19 on its m 2000 and Alinity m platforms. Molecular Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $318 million in the first six months of 2020. ​ In Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 8.1 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, as strong demand for Abbott’s point-of-care COVID-19 molecular test on its ID NOW platform in the U.S. and increased testing in the first quarter for the flu in the U.S. was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on routine diagnostic testing. Rapid Diagnostics COVID-19 testing-related sales were $182 million in the first six months of 2020. ​ Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales decreased 8.8 percent; the decrease was driven by the impact of COVID-19 on Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses, partially offset by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care. Growth in Diabetes Care sales was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, internationally and in the U.S. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $1.197 billion in the first six months of 2020, which reflected a 50.4 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over the first six months of 2019 when FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $812 million. In June, Abbott announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of FreeStyle Libre 2 as an integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) system for adults and children ages 4 and older with diabetes. ​ In Abbott’s cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses, revenues during the first six months of 2020 were negatively impacted by reduced procedure volumes due to COVID-19. Procedure volume trends improved over the course of the second quarter as both demand for procedures and availability of healthcare resources began to return to more normal levels. In April, Abbott announced CE Mark approval for its TriClip ® heart valve repair system, the world’s first minimally invasive, clip-based tricuspid heart valve repair device. In July, Abbott announced U.S. FDA approval of its next-generation Gallant™ implantable cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator devices to help manage heart rhythm disorders. These devices offer Bluetooth technology and a new patient smartphone app for improved remote monitoring and enhanced patient-physician engagement. ​ In April 2017, Abbott received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA related to its manufacturing facility in Sylmar, CA which was acquired by Abbott on January 4, 2017 as part of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. This facility manufactures implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, and monitors. Abbott prepared and executed a comprehensive plan of corrective actions. On April 28, 2020, Abbott received a letter from the FDA indicating that, based on the FDA’s evaluation, it appeared that Abbott had addressed the items in the warning letter. As a result, the warning letter is considered closed. ​ The gross profit margin percentage was 47.9 percent for the second quarter of 2020 compared to 52.8 percent for the second quarter of 2019. The gross profit margin percentage was 49.1 percent for the first six months of 2020 compared to 52.3 percent for the first six months of 2019. The decreases in the gross profit margin percentage primarily reflect the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 and the mix of geographical sales on the cardiovascular, neuromodulation and core diagnostic businesses, as well as the increase in intangible asset amortization and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on gross margin in 2020. ​ Research and development expenses decreased by $13 million, or 2.1 percent, in the second quarter of 2020 and decreased by $107 million, or 8.6 percent, in the first six months of 2020 compared to the prior year. The decrease in the second quarter of 2020 reflects lower R&D spending in various businesses and the favorable effect of foreign exchange. The decrease in R&D spending in the first six months of 2020 primarily reflects the immediate expensing in the first quarter of 2019 of an R&D asset valued at $102 million, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc. The decrease in R&D expense during the first six months of 2020 was also driven by the favorable effect of foreign exchange. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, research and development expenditures totaled $608 million for the Medical Devices segment, $270 million for the Diagnostic Products segment, $90 million for the Nutritional Products segment and $85 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. ​ Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 6.5 percent in the second quarter and decreased 1.8 percent in the first six months of 2020. The decrease in the quarter is primarily due to the favorable effect of foreign exchange, lower travel expenses due to COVID-19 mobility restrictions, and various cost saving initiatives to mitigate the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on sales in 2020. The decrease in the first six months of 2020 is due primarily to the favorable effect of foreign exchange. ​ Restructuring Plans ​ The results for the first six months of 2020 reflect charges under approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere or as a part of various cost reduction programs. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $33 million in the first six months of 2020 related to these initiatives, of which $4 million is recognized in Cost of products sold, $2 million is recognized in Research and development and $27 million is recognized in SG&A. See Note 7 to the financial statements, “Restructuring Plans,” for additional information regarding these charges. ​ ​ 21 Table of Contents Other (Income) Expense, net ​ Other (income) expense, net totaled $22 million of expense in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $38 million of income in 2019 and $21 million of expense in the first six months of 2020 compared to $85 million of income in 2019. The changes in Other (income) expense, net primarily reflect equity investment impairments that totaled approximately $60 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $110 million in the first six months of 2020. ​ Interest Expense, net ​ Interest expense, net decreased $21 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $48 million in the first six months of 2020 due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in November of 2019, the repayment of debt in 2019 and a lower interest rate environment in 2020. ​ Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first six months of 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $81 million in tax benefits related to the settlement of the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group’s 2014 through 2016 federal income tax returns in the U.S. and $67 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first six months of 2020 reflect the recognition of $20 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In the first six months of 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include a $78 million reduction to the transition tax related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and approximately $90 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The $78 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in the first quarter of 2019. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $70 million and $410 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In the U.S., Abbott's federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2015. ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources June 30, 2020 Compared with December 31, 2019 ​ On June 24, 2020, Abbott completed the issuance of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $650 million of its 1.15% Notes due 2028 and $650 million of its 1.40% Notes due 2030. Abbott intends to use the net proceeds from the notes offering to repay the approximately $1.3 billion of 0.00% Notes due September 2020. ​ The $903 million increase in cash and cash equivalents from $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019 to $4.8 billion at June 30, 2020 primarily reflects the proceeds from the issuance of $1.3 billion of debt and the favorable impact of cash generated by operating activities, partially offset by the payment of dividends and capital expenditures. Working capital was $6.3 billion at June 30, 2020 and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The $1.5 billion increase was due in large part to the higher level of cash and cash equivalents noted above as well as an increase in inventory related to shifting demand dynamics. ​ In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2020 totaled $2.0 billion, an increase of $265 million over the prior year due primarily to a decrease in cash taxes paid, payment timing for various accrued expenses and lower interest payments, partially offset by lower earnings from operations. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2020 was a use of $205 million and includes the impact of the payment of cash taxes of approximately $285 million and $335 million of pension contributions, partially offset by payment timing for various accrued expenses and the impact of non-cash charges related to equity investment impairments. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2019 was a use of $875 million and includes $326 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $615 million. Abbott expects to fund cash dividends, capital expenditures and its other investments in its businesses with cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand, short-term investments and borrowings. ​ In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. This bond redemption authorization superseded the board’s previous authorization under which $700 million had not yet been redeemed. In December 2019, Abbott redeemed $2.850 billion of debt. After this redemption, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion debt redemption authorization remains available. ​ At June 30, 2020, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was A- by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2023. ​ In October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. This authorization is in addition to the $270 million unused portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2014. ​ On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. No shares have been issued under this authorization. ​ In each of the first two quarters of 2020, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of approximately 12.5 percent over the $0.32 per share quarterly dividend declared in each of the first two quarters of 2019. ​ ​ 22 Table of Contents Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses , which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. ​ Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ​ In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. Abbott does not expect adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ Legislative Issues ​ Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​ Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements ​ Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott's operations and financial results, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors'', in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. ​ PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures ​ (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert B. Ford, and Chief Financial Officer, Robert E.

Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2020 (Unaudited) Note 1 — Basis of Presentation ​ The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. ​ Note 2 — New Accounting Standards ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses , which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. ​ Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ​ In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. Abbott does not expect adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ Note 3 — Revenue ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. ​ 8 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2020 (Unaudited) The following table provides revenues by sales category: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 ​ Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 813 ​ $ 813 ​ $ — ​ $ 752 ​ $ 752 Other ​ — ​ 231 ​ 231 ​ — ​ 240 ​ ​ 240 Total ​ — ​ 1,044 ​ 1,044 ​ — ​ 992 ​ 992 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 518 ​ 571 ​ 1,089 ​ 453 ​ 576 ​ 1,029 Adult Nutritionals ​ 294 ​ 521 ​ 815 ​ 294 ​ 469 ​ 763 Total ​ 812 ​ 1,092 ​ 1,904 ​ 747 ​ 1,045 ​ 1,792 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 267 ​ 722 ​ 989 ​ 249 ​ 812 ​ 1,061 Molecular ​ 65 ​ 74 ​ 139 ​ 40 ​ 68 ​ 108 Point of Care ​ 103 ​ 35 ​ 138 ​ 109 ​ 26 ​ 135 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 368 ​ 192 ​ 560 ​ 326 ​ 211 ​ 537 Total ​ 803 ​ 1,023 ​ 1,826 ​ 724 ​ 1,117 ​ 1,841 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Medical Devices - ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 228 ​ 246 ​ 474 ​ 252 ​ 262 ​ 514 Electrophysiology ​ 164 ​ 224 ​ 388 ​ 174 ​ 231 ​ 405 Heart Failure ​ 152 ​ 51 ​ 203 ​ 143 ​ 41 ​ 184 Vascular ​ 230 ​ 395 ​ 625 ​ 266 ​ 443 ​ 709 Structural Heart ​ 136 ​ 182 ​ 318 ​ 136 ​ 188 ​ 324 Neuromodulation ​ 137 ​ 40 ​ 177 ​ 152 ​ 41 ​ 193 Diabetes Care ​ ​ 186 ​ ​ 566 ​ ​ 752 ​ ​ 152 ​ ​ 414 ​ ​ 566 Total ​ 1,233 ​ 1,704 ​ 2,937 ​ 1,275 ​ 1,620 ​ 2,895 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 8 ​ 7 ​ 15 ​ 8 ​ 7 ​ 15 Total ​ $ 2,856 ​ $ 4,870 ​ $ 7,726 ​ $ 2,754 ​ $ 4,781 ​ $ 7,535 ​ Remaining Performance Obligations ​ As of March 31, 2020, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $ 3.4 billion in the Diagnostics segment and approximately $ 400 million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months , approximately 17 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. ​ These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. ​ Other Contract Assets and Liabilities ​ Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. ​ Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. ​ 9 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2020 (Unaudited) Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Contract Liabilities ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 294 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ 105 Revenue recognized related to contract liability balance ​ ( 94 ) Balance at March 31, 2020 ​ $ 305 ​ ​ Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information ​ Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were $ 541 million and $ 668 million, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were $ 561 million and $ 668 million, respectively. ​ Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first three months of 2020 includes $ 320 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 125 million. The first three months of 2019 includes $ 313 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 185 million. ​ Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first quarter of 2020 include the recognition of $ 20 million of tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to the previous sale of a business that was reported as a discontinued operation. ​ The following summarizes the activity for the first three months of 2020 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ ​ Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 228 Impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 ​ 7 Provisions/charges to income ​ ​ 21 Amounts charged off and other deductions ​ ( 15 ) Balance at March 31, 2020 ​ $ 241 ​ The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivables. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances. ​ The components of long-term investments as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ March 31, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Long-term Investments ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 741 ​ $ 836 Other ​ ​ 49 ​ ​ 47 Total $ 790 $ 883 ​ Abbott’s long-term investments as of March 31, 2020, declined versus the balance as of December 31, 2019, due in part to the impairment of an investment for approximately $ 50 million. ​ 10 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2020 (Unaudited) Abbott's equity securities as of March 31, 2020, include approximately $ 289 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. ​ Abbott also holds certain investments as of March 31, 2020 with a carrying value of approximately $ 275 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $ 162 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The $ 162 million carrying value includes cumulative unrealized gains of approximately $ 50 million. ​ In the first quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc., Abbott acquired a research & development (R&D) asset valued at $ 102 million, which was immediately expensed. The $ 102 million of expense was recorded in the R&D line of Abbott's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. ​ Note 5 — Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ​ The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended March 31 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (Losses) on ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Actuarial ​ Derivative ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ (Losses) and Prior ​ Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Service (Costs) ​ Designated as ​ ​ Adjustments ​ and Credits ​ Cash Flow Hedges (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Balance at January 1 ​ $ ( 4,924 ) ​ $ ( 4,912 ) ​ $ ( 3,540 ) ​ $ ( 2,726 ) ​ $ ( 1 ) ​ $ 52 Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ( 1,144 ) ​ 122 ​ ​ 7 ​ ( 1 ) ​ 176 ​ ( 17 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ — ​ 50 ​ 24 ​ ( 10 ) ​ ( 12 ) Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ ( 1,144 ) ​ 122 ​ 57 ​ 23 ​ 166 ​ ( 29 ) Balance at March 31 ​ $ ( 6,068 ) ​ $ ( 4,790 ) ​ $ ( 3,483 ) ​ $ ( 2,703 ) ​ $ 165 ​ $ 23 ​ Reclassified amounts for foreign currency translation are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as Net foreign exchange (gain) loss; and amounts for cash flow hedges are recorded as Cost of products sold. Net actuarial losses and prior service cost are included as a component of net periodic benefit costs; see Note 12 for additional details. ​ Note 6 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets ​ The total amount of goodwill reported was $ 22.9 billion at March 31, 2020 and $ 23.2 billion at December 31, 2019. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $ 268 million in the first three months of 2020. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at March 31, 2020 was $ 2.8 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.6 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 16.1 billion for the Medical Devices segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first three months of 2020. ​ The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $ 27.3 billion as of March 31, 2020 and $ 27.6 billion as of December 31, 2019, and accumulated amortization was $ 12.3 billion as of March 31, 2020 and $ 11.9 billion as of December 31, 2019. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $ 204 million for the first three months of 2020. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.1 billion in 2020, $ 2.0 billion in 2021, 2022 , and 2023 and $ 1.9 billion in 2024. ​ Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process R&D acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 1.2 billion and $ 1.3 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively . ​ 11 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2020 (Unaudited) Note 7 — Restructuring Plans ​ From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Medical Devices segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostic Products segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. In the first three months of 2020, charges of $ 9 million were recognized, of which $ 3 million is recorded in Cost of products sold, $ 1 million is recorded in Research and development and $ 5 million as Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for the first three months of 2020 related to these actions and the status of the related accrual as of March 31, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 46 Restructuring charges recorded in 2020 ​ ​ 9 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 18 ) Accrued balance at March 31, 2020 ​ $ 37 ​ From 2017 to 2020, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. In the first three months of 2020, charges of $ 23 million were recognized, of which $ 1 million is recorded in Cost of products sold, $ 1 million is recorded in Research and development and $ 21 million as Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for the first three months of 2020 related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accrual as of March 31, 2020: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2019 ​ $ 79 Restructuring charges recorded in 2020 ​ ​ 23 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 8 ) Accrued balance at March 31, 2020 ​ $ 94 ​ ​ Note 8 — Incentive Stock Program ​ In the first three months of 2020, Abbott granted 3,956,637 stock options, 568,471 restricted stock awards and 5,042,550 restricted stock units under its incentive stock program. At March 31, 2020, approximately 112 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at March 31, 2020 is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 32,412,976 ​ 23,330,203 Weighted average remaining life ( years ) 6.5 ​ 5.5 Weighted average exercise price $ 53.83 ​ $ 44.69 Aggregate intrinsic value ( in millions ) $ 849 ​ $ 798 ​ The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at March 31, 2020 amounted to approximately $ 687 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . ​ Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit ​ On February 24, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $ 500 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.80 % Notes due 2020. ​ ​ Note 10 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures ​ Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 7.0 billion at March 31, 2020 and $ 6.8 billion at December 31, 2019 are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of March 31, 2020 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . ​ Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Abbott held the gross notional amount of $ 9.5 billion and $ 9.1 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. ​ Abbott has designated a yen-denominated, 5-year term loan of approximately $ 554 million and $ 546 million as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. ​ 12 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2020 (Unaudited) Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. ​ The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value - Assets ​ Fair Value - Liabilities ​ ​ March 31, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ ​ March 31, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 Balance Sheet Caption 2020 2019 Balance Sheet Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 216 $ 48 Deferred income taxes and other assets $ — $ — Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Hedging instruments ​ 247 ​ 110 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 92 ​ 56 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges ​ 117 ​ 38 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 97 ​ 33 Other accrued liabilities Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ n/a ​ ​ 554 ​ ​ 546 ​ Long-term debt ​ $ 580 $ 196 ​ ​ $ 743 $ 635 ​ ​ ​ The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gain (loss) Recognized in Other ​ Income (expense) and Gain (loss) ​ ​ ​ ​ Comprehensive Income (loss) ​ Reclassified into Income ​ ​ (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Income Statement Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges ​ $ 227 ​ $ ( 19 ) ​ $ 11 ​ $ 15 ​ Cost of products sold ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Debt designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign subsidiary ​ ​ ( 8 ) ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ ​ — ​ n/a ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ 168 ​ 43 ​ Interest expense ​ Losses of $ 165 million and gains of $ 49 million were recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as a hedge.

The fair value of debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. ​ ​ 14 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2020 (Unaudited) Note 11 — Litigation and Environmental Matters ​ Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. ​ Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 90 million to $ 125 million. The recorded accrual balance at March 31, 2020 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 110 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ​ Note 12 — Post-Employment Benefits ​ Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized in continuing operations for the three months ended March 31 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined Benefit Plans ​ Medical and Dental Plans ​ ​ March 31, ​ March 31, ​ March 31, ​ March 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Service cost - benefits earned during the period ​ $ 85 ​ $ 64 ​ $ 12 ​ $ 6 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations ​ 75 ​ 84 ​ 12 ​ 13 Expected return on plan assets ​ ( 192 ) ​ ( 178 ) ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 7 ) Net amortization of: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Actuarial loss, net ​ 63 ​ 33 ​ 8 ​ 6 Prior service cost (credit) ​ — ​ — ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 8 ) Net cost - continuing operations ​ $ 31 ​ $ 3 ​ $ 18 ​ $ 10 ​ Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to IRS funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first three months of 2020 and 2019, $ 320 million and $ 313 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans and $ 11 million was contributed to the post-employment medical and dental benefit plans in each year. ​ Note 13 — Taxes on Earnings ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $ 47 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first three months of 2020 reflect the recognition of $ 20 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In the first three months of 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include a $ 78 million reduction to the transition tax related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and approximately $ 65 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $ 230 million and $ 520 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2015 and the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. ​ 15 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2020 (Unaudited) Note 14 — Segment Information ​ Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world. ​ Abbott’s reportable segments are as follows: ​ Established Pharmaceutical Products — International sales of a broad line of branded generic pharmaceutical products. ​ Nutritional Products — Worldwide sales of a broad line of adult and pediatric nutritional products. ​ Diagnostic Products — Worldwide sales of diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, physician offices and alternate-care testing sites. For segment reporting purposes, the Core Laboratories Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics divisions are aggregated and reported as the Diagnostic Products segment. ​ Medical Devices — Worldwide sales of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care products. For segment reporting purposes, the Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology and Heart Failure, Vascular, Neuromodulation, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care divisions are aggregated and reported as the Medical Devices segment. ​ Abbott’s underlying accounting records are maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting requirements. Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. Intersegment transfers of inventory are recorded at standard cost and are not a measure of segment operating earnings. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment’s assets. ​ The following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended March 31 ​ ​ Net Sales to ​ Operating ​ ​ External Customers ​ Earnings (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Established Pharmaceutical Products ​ $ 1,044 ​ $ 992 ​ $ 181 ​ $ 159 Nutritional Products ​ 1,904 ​ 1,792 ​ 459 ​ 380 Diagnostic Products ​ 1,826 ​ 1,841 ​ 405 ​ 434 Medical Devices ​ 2,937 ​ 2,895 ​ 803 ​ 847 Total Reportable Segments ​ 7,711 ​ 7,520 ​ 1,848 ​ 1,820 Other ​ 15 ​ 15 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net sales ​ $ 7,726 ​ $ 7,535 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Corporate functions and benefit plans costs ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 132 ) ​ ​ ( 102 ) Net interest expense ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 121 ) ​ ​ ( 148 ) Share-based compensation (a) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 233 ) ​ ​ ( 226 ) Amortization of intangible assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 561 ) ​ ​ ( 486 ) Other, net (b) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 168 ) ​ ​ ( 226 ) Earnings from continuing operations before taxes ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 633 ​ $ 632 ​ ​ 16 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ​ Financial Review - Results of Operations ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals. ​ During the first quarter of 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected Abbott’s diversified health care businesses in various ways. As is further described below, some businesses faced challenges, others have been relatively stable, and still others are performing at the levels required to successfully meet new demands. Beginning in February, cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures and routine core laboratory diagnostic testing volumes declined in China as that country implemented quarantine restrictions and postponed non-emergency health care activities. As March progressed, procedures and routine testing volumes in China steadily improved from the low levels seen in February. As COVID-19 spread geographically, the impact initially expanded to certain countries in Asia and Europe beginning in late February, and more broadly across Europe and the U.S. during the last few weeks of March. As the health care industry in these countries shifted their focus to fighting COVID-19, the impact on cardiovascular and neuromodulation device procedures and routine diagnostic testing volumes was similar to what was experienced in China in February. Due to the critical nature of these products, Abbott anticipates increased demand when health care services return to more normal levels. ​ Abbott has mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch three new diagnostic tests for COVID-19. In March, Abbott launched a molecular test to detect COVID-19 on its ID NOW™ rapid point-of-care platform in the U.S. pursuant to an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). Abbott also launched a molecular test on its m 2000™ RealTi m e lab-based platform to detect COVID-19 pursuant to an EUA in the U.S. and CE Mark. In April, Abbott launched a serology blood test on its ARCHITECT ® i1000SR and i2000SR laboratory instruments for the detection of an antibody to determine if someone was previously infected. The serology test was granted an EUA in the U.S. on April 26, 2020 and CE Mark on April 24, 2020. ​ Abbott is continually implementing business continuity plans in the face of the global crisis. Due to the critical nature of its products and services, Abbott is generally exempt from governmental orders in the U.S. and other countries requiring businesses to cease operations. To protect its employees, the majority of its office-based work is being conducted remotely and the company has implemented strict travel restrictions. Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of its facilities for employees working to continue to supply healthcare products to hospital and other customers. ​ With respect to Abbott’s financial position, at the end of the first quarter of 2020, Abbott’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled approximately $3.7 billion and existing credit agreements are in place that would provide additional access to $5 billion, if needed. ​ Due to uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott is unable to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. ​ 17 Table of Contents The following table details sales by reportable segment for the three months ended March 31.

Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in the Key Emerging Markets increased 13.1 percent compared to the first three months of 2019 led by growth in Russia and various countries in Latin America and southeast Asia. Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, decreased by 2.7 percent in the first three months of 2020. ​ International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, were relatively flat in the first three months of 2020 versus the comparable 2019 period. Growth across Abbott’s pediatric products in various countries in Asia and Latin America along with higher consumer purchases in several countries in advance of shelter in place restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic were offset by challenging market dynamics in the Greater China infant category, including the unfavorable impact of COVID-19. U.S. Pediatric Nutritional sales increased 14.3 percent primarily due to increased demand in late March in advance of shelter in place restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 13.8 percent increase in International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects continued growth of the Glucerna ® and Ensure ® brands in several countries. U.S. Adult Nutritional sales were relatively flat due to the timing of retailer stocking for promotional programs. ​ In the Diagnostics segment, Core Laboratory sales decreased 4.9 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, as the volume of routine testing performed in hospital and other laboratories was negatively impacted by COVID-19. In April 2020, Abbott launched a lab-based serology blood test for the detection of the antibody, IgG, that identifies if a person was previously infected with COVID-19. The 30.3 percent increase in Molecular Diagnostics sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects higher volumes due to the launch in March 2020 of Abbott’s RealTi me SARS-CoV-2 test for use on Abbott’s m 2000 RealTi me System to detect COVID-19. ​ In Rapid Diagnostics, sales increased 5.4 percent, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, as increased testing for flu in the U.S. was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of COVID-19 on routine diagnostic testing performed in various countries outside of the U.S. In late March, Abbott launched a molecular test for the detection of COVID-19 that is run on Abbott’s point-of-care ID NOW instruments. ​ Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales grew 2.9 percent; the increase was driven by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care and Heart Failure partially offset by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott’s other medical device businesses. Growth in Diabetes Care sales was driven by continued growth of FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system, internationally and in the U.S. FreeStyle Libre sales totaled $604 million in the first quarter of 2020, which reflected a 62.5 percent increase, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, over the first three months of 2019 when Libre sales totaled $379 million. ​ ​ 19 Table of Contents In Heart Failure, sales growth was driven by continued market adoption of Abbott's HeartMate 3 ® Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) for people living with advanced heart failure as well as increased sales of Abbott’s CentriMag™ circulatory support system for use in acute hospital care. In Abbott’s other cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses, revenues were negatively impacted by reduced procedure volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ​ In April 2017, Abbott received a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) related to its manufacturing facility in Sylmar, CA which was acquired by Abbott on January 4, 2017 as part of the acquisition of St. Jude Medical. This facility manufactures implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, and monitors. Abbott prepared and executed a comprehensive plan of corrective actions. On April 28, 2020, Abbott received a letter from the FDA indicating that, based on the FDA’s evaluation, it appeared that Abbott had addressed the items in the warning letter. As a result, the warning letter is considered closed. ​ The gross profit margin percentage was 50.3 percent for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 51.6 percent for the first quarter of 2019. The decrease primarily reflects the increase in intangible amortization expense and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on gross margin in 2020. ​ Research and development expenses decreased $94 million, or 14.1 percent, in the first quarter of 2020. The 2020 decrease in R&D expense was primarily driven by the immediate expensing of an R&D asset valued at $102 million in the first quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, research and development expenditures totaled $309 million for the Medical Devices segment, $134 million for the Diagnostic Products segment, $46 million for the Nutritional Products segment and $43 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. ​ Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter of 2020 increased 2.8 percent due primarily to higher selling and marketing costs to drive growth across various businesses. ​ Restructuring Plans ​ The results for the first three months of 2020 reflect charges under approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere or as a part of various cost reduction programs. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $32 million in the first three months of 2020 related to these initiatives, of which $4 million is recognized in Cost of products sold, $2 million is recognized in Research and development and $26 million is recognized in SG&A. See Note 7 to the financial statements, “Restructuring Plans,” for additional information regarding these charges. ​ Other (Income) Expense, net ​ Other (income) expense, net decreased $46 million in the first quarter of 2020 from $47 million of income in 2019 to $1 million in 2020. The decrease in income in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to an impairment of an equity investment of approximately $50 million in 2020. ​ Interest Expense, net ​ Interest expense, net decreased $27 million in the first quarter of 2020 due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt financing in November of 2019 and the repayment of debt in 2019. ​ Taxes on Earnings ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2020, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $47 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first three months of 2020 reflect the recognition of $20 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years. In the first three months of 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include a $78 million reduction to the transition tax related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and approximately $65 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $230 million and $520 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In the U.S., Abbott's federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2015 and the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources March 31, 2020 Compared with December 31, 2019 ​ The reduction of cash and cash equivalents from $3.9 billion at December 31, 2019 to $3.4 billion at March 31, 2020 primarily reflects the payment of dividends and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash generated from operations in the first three months of 2020. Working capital was $4.7 billion at March 31, 2020 and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease in working capital in 2020 primarily reflects the decrease in cash and cash equivalents partially offset by an increase in inventory. ​ 20 Table of Contents In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first three months of 2020 totaled $715 million, an increase of $3 million over the prior year as the negative impact of an increased investment in working capital was offset by lower cash taxes paid and higher operating earnings. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first three months of 2020 was a use of $369 million and includes $320 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $125 million. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first three months of 2019 was a use of $483 million and includes $313 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $185 million. ​ In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. This bond redemption authorization superseded the board’s previous authorization under which $700 million had not yet been redeemed. In December 2019, Abbott redeemed $2.850 billion of debt. After this redemption, $2.15 billion of the $5 billion debt redemption authorization remains available. ​ At March 31, 2020, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was A- by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2023. ​ In October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. The new authorization is in addition to the $270 million unused portion of the share repurchase program authorized in 2014. ​ On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. No shares have been issued under this authorization. ​ In the first quarter of 2020, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of approximately 12.5 percent over the $0.32 per share dividend declared in the first quarter of 2019. ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2020 and recorded a cumulative adjustment that was not significant to Earnings employed in the business in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. ​ Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ​ In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which among other things, eliminates certain exceptions in the current rules regarding the approach for intraperiod tax allocations and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard becomes effective for Abbott in the first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. Abbott does not expect adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ​ Legislative Issues ​ Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​ Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements ​ Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott's operations and financial results, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors'', in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, in the quarterly report for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. ​ 21 Table of Contents PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION ​ Item 4. Controls and Procedures ​ (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert B. Ford, and Chief Financial Officer, Robert E. Funck, Jr., evaluated the effectiveness of Abbott Laboratories’ disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that Abbott Laboratories’ disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information Abbott is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Abbott in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Abbott’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. ​ (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, there were no changes in Abbott’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Abbott’s internal control over financial reporting. ​ PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ​ Item 1. Legal Proceedings ​ Abbott is involved in various claims, legal proceedings and investigations, including those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. ​ Item 1A. Risk Factors ​ There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, except for the following: ​ Abbott is subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic. ​ As a global healthcare company, public health crises, such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact Abbott's operations. Health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause significant reductions in demand for routine diagnostic testing and medical device procedures or increased difficulty in serving customers, disrupt manufacturing and supply chains, and negatively affect our operations as well as the operations of our suppliers, distributors and other third-party partners. Furthermore, such widespread outbreaks may impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. Due to uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott is unable to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. ​ ​ 22 Table of Contents Item 2.

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2019 (Unaudited) Note 1 — Basis of Presentation ​ The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. ​ Note 2 — New Accounting Standards ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases , which requires lessees to measure and recognize a lease asset and liability on the balance sheet for most leases, including operating leases. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and applied the standard’s transition provisions as of January 1, 2019. As a result, no changes were made to the December 31, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Abbott elected to apply the package of practical expedients related to transition. These practical expedients allowed Abbott to carry forward its historical assessments of whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for each lease existing at January 1, 2019, and whether any initial direct costs for such leases qualified for capitalization. ​ The new lease accounting standard does not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings but does have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of approximately $ 850 million of new right of use (ROU) assets and additional liabilities for operating leases on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019. ​ Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ​ In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. The new standard will be effective for Abbott at the beginning of 2020, with early adoption permitted. Abbott is currently assessing the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. ​ Note 3 — Revenue ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products. Diabetes Care is a non-reportable segment and is included in Other. ​ 9 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2019 (Unaudited) The following tables provide detail by sales category: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 ​ Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 891 ​ $ 891 ​ $ — ​ $ 866 ​ $ 866 Other ​ — ​ 321 ​ 321 ​ — ​ 293 ​ ​ 293 Total ​ — ​ 1,212 ​ 1,212 ​ — ​ 1,159 ​ 1,159 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 478 ​ 566 ​ 1,044 ​ 459 ​ 580 ​ 1,039 Adult Nutritionals ​ 310 ​ 520 ​ 830 ​ 315 ​ 484 ​ 799 Total ​ 788 ​ 1,086 ​ 1,874 ​ 774 ​ 1,064 ​ 1,838 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 272 ​ 905 ​ 1,177 ​ 249 ​ 837 ​ 1,086 Molecular ​ 35 ​ 76 ​ 111 ​ 37 ​ 84 ​ 121 Point of Care ​ 112 ​ 32 ​ 144 ​ 106 ​ 30 ​ 136 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 283 ​ 194 ​ 477 ​ 274 ​ 207 ​ 481 Total ​ 702 ​ 1,207 ​ 1,909 ​ 666 ​ 1,158 ​ 1,824 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 265 ​ 273 ​ 538 ​ 272 ​ 261 ​ 533 Electrophysiology ​ 185 ​ 242 ​ 427 ​ 169 ​ 212 ​ 381 Heart Failure ​ 136 ​ 50 ​ 186 ​ 111 ​ 41 ​ 152 Vascular ​ 251 ​ 446 ​ 697 ​ 284 ​ 436 ​ 720 Structural Heart ​ 158 ​ 190 ​ 348 ​ 126 ​ 179 ​ 305 Neuromodulation ​ 165 ​ 39 ​ 204 ​ 172 ​ 40 ​ 212 Total ​ 1,160 ​ 1,240 ​ 2,400 ​ 1,134 ​ 1,169 ​ 2,303 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 184 ​ 497 ​ 681 ​ 133 ​ 399 ​ 532 Total ​ $ 2,834 ​ $ 5,242 ​ $ 8,076 ​ $ 2,707 ​ $ 4,949 ​ $ 7,656 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 ​ Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 2,496 ​ $ 2,496 ​ $ — ​ $ 2,525 ​ $ 2,525 Other ​ — ​ 816 ​ 816 ​ — ​ 807 ​ ​ 807 Total ​ — ​ 3,312 ​ 3,312 ​ — ​ 3,332 ​ 3,332 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 1,406 ​ 1,718 ​ 3,124 ​ 1,376 ​ 1,708 ​ 3,084 Adult Nutritionals ​ 915 ​ 1,502 ​ 2,417 ​ 937 ​ 1,431 ​ 2,368 Total ​ 2,321 ​ 3,220 ​ 5,541 ​ 2,313 ​ 3,139 ​ 5,452 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 793 ​ 2,614 ​ 3,407 ​ 725 ​ 2,508 ​ 3,233 Molecular ​ 113 ​ 213 ​ 326 ​ 114 ​ 247 ​ 361 Point of Care ​ 334 ​ 90 ​ 424 ​ 324 ​ 92 ​ 416 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 881 ​ 617 ​ 1,498 ​ 855 ​ 669 ​ 1,524 Total ​ 2,121 ​ 3,534 ​ 5,655 ​ 2,018 ​ 3,516 ​ 5,534 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 790 ​ 810 ​ 1,600 ​ 843 ​ 824 ​ 1,667 Electrophysiology ​ 549 ​ 713 ​ 1,262 ​ 499 ​ 645 ​ 1,144 Heart Failure ​ 428 ​ 143 ​ 571 ​ 342 ​ 126 ​ 468 Vascular ​ 787 ​ 1,349 ​ 2,136 ​ 854 ​ 1,355 ​ 2,209 Structural Heart ​ 446 ​ 578 ​ 1,024 ​ 353 ​ 560 ​ 913 Neuromodulation ​ 485 ​ 124 ​ 609 ​ 513 ​ 133 ​ 646 Total ​ 3,485 ​ 3,717 ​ 7,202 ​ 3,404 ​ 3,643 ​ 7,047 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 511 ​ 1,369 ​ 1,880 ​ 349 ​ 1,099 ​ 1,448 Total ​ $ 8,438 ​ $ 15,152 ​ $ 23,590 ​ $ 8,084 ​ $ 14,729 ​ $ 22,813 ​ Note: Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) sales, which had previously been reported in Electrophysiology, are now included in Rhythm Management.

Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months , approximately 16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. ​ These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. ​ Other Contract Assets and Liabilities ​ Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at their net realizable value. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. ​ Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. ​ Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Contract Liabilities: ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2018 ​ $ 259 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ 285 Revenue recognized that was included in contract liability balance at beginning of period ​ ( 249 ) Balance at September 30, 2019 ​ $ 295 ​ ​ Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information ​ Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $ 954 million and $ 548 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $ 2.622 billion and $ 1.669 billion, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $ 954 million and $ 560 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $ 2.622 billion and $ 1.704 billion, respectively. ​ Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first nine months of 2019 includes $ 337 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 775 million. The first nine months of 2018 includes the favorable impact of improvements in working capital management, as well as the effect of non-cash charges related to the impairment of certain assets and the accrual of certain debt extinguishment costs. ​ The components of long-term investments as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ September 30, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 Long-term Investments: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 830 ​ $ 856 Other ​ ​ 44 ​ ​ 41 Total $ 874 $ 897 ​ ​ 11 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2019 (Unaudited) Abbott's equity securities as of September 30, 2019, include approximately $ 330 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. ​ Abbott also holds certain investments as of September 30, 2019 with a carrying value of approximately $ 335 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $ 155 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The $ 155 million carrying value includes cumulative unrealized gains of approximately $ 50 million. ​ In the first quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc., Abbott acquired a research & development (R&D) asset valued at $ 102 million, which was immediately expensed. The $ 102 million of expense was recorded in the R&D line of Abbott's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. ​ Note 5 — Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ​ The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended September 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative ​ (Losses) on ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Actuarial ​ Unrealized Gains ​ Derivative ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ (Losses) and Prior ​ (Losses) on ​ Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Service (Costs) ​ Marketable Equity ​ Designated as (in millions) ​ Adjustments ​ and Credits ​ Securities ​ Cash Flow Hedges ​ 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Balance at June 30 ​ $ ( 4,699 ) ​ $ ( 4,478 ) ​ $ ( 2,677 ) ​ $ ( 2,437 ) ​ $ — ​ $ — ​ $ 11 ​ $ 2 Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ( 478 ) ​ ( 153 ) ​ ​ 7 ​ — ​ — ​ — ​ 67 ​ 10 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ — ​ 24 ​ 22 ​ — ​ — ​ ( 18 ) ​ 25 Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ ( 478 ) ​ ( 153 ) ​ 31 ​ 22 ​ — ​ — ​ 49 ​ 35 Balance at September 30 ​ $ ( 5,177 ) ​ $ ( 4,631 ) ​ $ ( 2,646 ) ​ $ ( 2,415 ) ​ $ — ​ $ — ​ $ 60 ​ $ 37 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nine Months Ended September 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative ​ (Losses) on ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Actuarial ​ Unrealized Gains ​ Derivative ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ (Losses) and Prior ​ (Losses) on ​ Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Service (Costs) ​ Marketable Equity ​ Designated as (in millions) ​ Adjustments and Credits Securities Cash Flow Hedges ​ 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Balance at December 31 , 2018 and 2017 ​ $ ( 4,912 ) ​ $ ( 3,452 ) ​ $ ( 2,726 ) ​ $ ( 2,521 ) ​ $ — ​ $ ( 5 ) ​ $ 52 ​ $ ( 84 ) Impact of adoption of new accounting standard ​ ​ — ​ — ​ — ​ — ​ — ​ 5 ​ — ​ — Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ ( 265 ) ​ ( 1,179 ) ​ 9 ​ — ​ — ​ — ​ 48 ​ 38 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ ​ — ​ 71 ​ 106 ​ — ​ — ​ ( 40 ) ​ 83 Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ ( 265 ) ​ ( 1,179 ) ​ 80 ​ 106 ​ — ​ — ​ 8 ​ 121 Balance at September 30 ​ $ ( 5,177 ) ​ $ ( 4,631 ) ​ $ ( 2,646 ) ​ $ ( 2,415 ) ​ $ — ​ $ — ​ $ 60 ​ $ 37 ​ Reclassified amounts for foreign currency translation are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as Net foreign exchange (gain) loss and cash flow hedges as Cost of products sold.

Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $ 252 million during the first nine months of 2019. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at September 30, 2019 was $ 3.0 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.7 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 15.2 billion for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first nine months of 2019. ​ The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $ 25.1 billion as of September 30, 2019 and $ 25.7 billion as of December 31, 2018, and accumulated amortization was $ 11.2 billion as of September 30, 2019 and $ 10.4 billion as of December 31, 2018. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by approximately $ 110 million during the first nine months of 2019. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 1.9 billion in 2019, $ 2.1 billion in 2020, $ 2.0 billion in 2021, $ 2.0 billion in 2022 and $ 2.0 billion in 2023. ​ Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 3.6 billion as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . ​ Note 7 — Restructuring Plans ​ From 2017 to 2019, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the Diagnostics segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. In the first nine months of 2019, charges of $ 66 million were recognized, of which $ 18 million is recorded in Cost of products sold, $ 4 million is recorded in Research and development and $ 44 million as Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for the first nine months of 2019 related to these actions and the status of the related accrual as of September 30, 2019: ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2018 ​ $ 41 Restructuring charges recorded in 2019 ​ ​ 66 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 45 ) Accrued balance at September 30, 2019 ​ $ 62 ​ From 2016 to 2019, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses, including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. In the first nine months of 2019, charges of $ 35 million were recognized, of which $ 10 million is recorded in Cost of products sold, $ 8 million is recorded in Research and development and $ 17 million as Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for the first nine months of 2019 related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accrual as of September 30, 2019: ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2018 ​ $ 70 Restructuring charges recorded in 2019 ​ ​ 35 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 29 ) Accrued balance at September 30, 2019 ​ $ 76 ​ ​ Note 8 — Incentive Stock Programs ​ In the first nine months of 2019, Abbott granted 4,579,283 stock options, 736,100 restricted stock awards and 6,568,376 restricted stock units under its incentive stock programs. At September 30, 2019, approximately 126 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2019 is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 30,219,778 ​ 20,793,077 Weighted average remaining life ( years ) 6.5 ​ 5.5 Weighted average exercise price $ 48.65 ​ $ 41.13 Aggregate intrinsic value ( in millions ) $ 1,058 ​ $ 885 ​ ​ 13 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2019 (Unaudited) The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at September 30, 2019 amounted to approximately $ 501 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . ​ Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit ​ On February 24, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $ 500 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.80 % Notes due 2020. ​ In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $ 5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. This bond redemption authorization supersedes the board's previous authorization under which $ 700 million had not yet been redeemed. ​ Note 10 — Leases ​ Leases where Abbott is the Lessee ​ Abbott has entered into operating leases as the lessee for office space, manufacturing facilities, R&D laboratories, warehouses, vehicles and equipment. Finance leases are not significant. Abbott’s operating leases generally have remaining lease terms of 1 to 10 years . Some leases include options to extend beyond the original lease term, generally up to 10 years and some include options to terminate early. These options have been included in the determination of the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. ​ For all of its asset classes, Abbott elected the practical expedient allowed under FASB ASC No. 842, “Leases” to account for each lease component (e.g., the right to use office space) and the associated non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services) as a single lease component. Abbott also elected the short-term lease accounting policy for all asset classes; therefore, Abbott is not recognizing a lease liability or ROU asset for any lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that Abbott is reasonably certain to exercise. ​ As Abbott’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the interest rate used to determine the present value of the payments under each lease typically reflects Abbott’s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. Abbott’s incremental borrowing rates at January 1, 2019 were used for operating leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019. ​ The following table provides information related to Abbott’s operating leases: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended (in millions) ​ September 30, 2019 ​ September 30, 2019 Operating lease cost (a) ​ $ 79 ​ $ 233 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities ​ $ 64 ​ $ 190 ROU assets arising from entering into new operating lease obligations ​ $ 104 ​ $ 201 ​ The weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate for operating leases as of September 30, 2019 were 8 years and 4.1 %, respectively. ​ Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of September 30, 2019 were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ 2019 ​ $ 61 2020 ​ ​ 225 2021 ​ 177 2022 ​ 137 2023 ​ ​ 98 Thereafter ​ ​ 380 Total future minimum lease payments – undiscounted ​ 1,078 Less: imputed interest ​ ( 174 ) Present value of lease liabilities ​ $ 904 ​ ​ 14 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2019 (Unaudited) The following table summarizes the amounts and location of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities as of September 30, 2019: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) September 30, 2019 Balance Sheet Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Lease - ROU Asset ​ $ 881 Deferred income taxes and other assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Lease Liability: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Current ​ $ 202 Other accrued liabilities Non-current ​ ​ 702 Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Total Liability ​ $ 904 ​ Leases where Abbott is the Lessor ​ Certain assets, primarily diagnostics instruments, are leased to customers under contractual arrangements that typically include an operating or sales-type lease as well as performance obligations for reagents and other consumables. Sales-type leases are not significant. Contract terms vary by customer and may include options to terminate the contract or options to extend the contract. Where instruments are provided under operating lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g., reagent) sales. The allocation of revenue between the lease and non-lease components is based on stand-alone selling prices. Operating lease revenue represented less than 3 percent of Abbott’s total net sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019. ​ Assets related to operating leases are reported within Net property and equipment on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $ 2.7 billion and $ 1.1 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2019. ​ Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures ​ Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 6.3 billion at September 30, 2019 and $ 5.1 billion at December 31, 2018 are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of September 30, 2019 on contracts related to intercompany purchases will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . ​ Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Abbott held the gross notional amount of $ 10.4 billion and $ 13.6 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. ​ Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. ​ 15 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2019 (Unaudited) The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value - Assets ​ Fair Value - Liabilities ​ ​ Sept. 30, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ ​ Sept. 30, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ (in millions) 2019 2018 Balance Sheet Caption 2019 2018 Balance Sheet Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 74 $ — Deferred income taxes and other assets $ — $ 100 Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Hedging instruments ​ 244 ​ 81 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 33 ​ 44 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges ​ 54 ​ 33 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 62 ​ 51 Other accrued liabilities ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 372 $ 114 ​ ​ $ 95 $ 195 ​ ​ ​ The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gain (loss) Recognized in Other ​ Income (expense) and Gain (loss) ​ ​ ​ ​ Comprehensive Income (loss) ​ Reclassified into Income ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ ​ ​ ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Ended Sept. 30 ​ Income Statement (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges ​ $ 99 ​ $ 18 ​ $ 78 ​ $ 45 ​ $ 26 ​ $ ( 37 ) ​ $ 58 ​ $ ( 120 ) ​ Cost of products sold ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ ​ n/a ​ ​ n/a ​ 35 ​ ( 42 ) ​ ​ 174 ​ ​ ( 179 ) ​ Interest expense ​ Gains of $ 49 million and losses of $ 10 million were recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as a hedge.

Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. ​ Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 110 million to $ 140 million. The recorded accrual balance at September 30, 2019 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 125 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ​ Note 13 — Post-Employment Benefits ​ Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized in continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined Benefit Plans ​ Medical and Dental Plans ​ ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months (in millions) ​ Ended September 30 ​ Ended September 30 ​ Ended September 30 ​ Ended September 30 ​ 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Service cost - benefits earned during the period ​ $ 63 ​ $ 76 ​ $ 188 ​ $ 221 ​ $ 5 ​ $ 7 ​ $ 17 ​ $ 20 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations ​ 84 ​ 77 ​ 253 ​ 232 ​ 13 ​ 12 ​ 39 ​ 36 Expected return on plan assets ​ ( 177 ) ​ ( 169 ) ​ ( 533 ) ​ ( 511 ) ​ ( 6 ) ​ ( 9 ) ​ ( 20 ) ​ ( 25 ) Net amortization of: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Actuarial loss, net ​ 33 ​ 51 ​ 99 ​ 154 ​ 6 ​ 8 ​ 17 ​ 25 Prior service cost (credit) ​ — ​ — ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ ( 8 ) ​ ( 11 ) ​ ( 24 ) ​ ( 34 ) Net cost - continuing operations ​ $ 3 ​ $ 35 ​ $ 8 ​ $ 97 ​ $ 10 ​ $ 7 ​ $ 29 ​ $ 22 ​ Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to IRS funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first nine months of 2019 and 2018, $ 337 million and $ 71 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans and $ 11 million was contributed to the post-employment medical and dental benefit plans in each year. ​ Note 14 — Taxes on Earnings ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first nine months of 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include a $ 78 million reduction to the transition tax related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and approximately $ 95 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The $ 78 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in the first quarter. This adjustment decreased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $ 1.51 billion. In the first nine months of 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $ 80 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and a $ 53 million adjustment to the transition tax liability for associated effects related to state tax. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2018 reflect the recognition of $ 40 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years which decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by $ 47 million. ​ 18 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2019 (Unaudited) Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $ 185 million and $ 430 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2014 and the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. ​ Note 15 — Segment Information ​ Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.

The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment’s assets. ​ The following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements. ​ 19 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements September 30, 2019 (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Sales to External Customers ​ Operating Earnings ​ ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ Three Months ​ Nine Months ​ ​ Ended September 30 ​ Ended September 30 ​ Ended September 30 ​ Ended September 30 (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Established Pharmaceutical Products ​ $ 1,212 ​ $ 1,159 ​ $ 3,312 ​ $ 3,332 ​ $ 281 ​ $ 289 ​ $ 654 ​ $ 664 Nutritional Products ​ 1,874 ​ 1,838 ​ 5,541 ​ 5,452 ​ 414 ​ 435 ​ 1,241 ​ 1,224 Diagnostic Products ​ 1,909 ​ 1,824 ​ 5,655 ​ 5,534 ​ 456 ​ 443 ​ 1,356 ​ 1,375 Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products ​ 2,400 ​ 2,303 ​ 7,202 ​ 7,047 ​ 741 ​ 730 ​ 2,179 ​ 2,215 Total Reportable Segments ​ 7,395 ​ 7,124 ​ 21,710 ​ 21,365 ​ 1,892 ​ 1,897 ​ 5,430 ​ ​ 5,478 Other ​ 681 ​ 532 ​ 1,880 ​ 1,448 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net sales ​ $ 8,076 ​ $ 7,656 ​ $ 23,590 ​ $ 22,813 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Corporate functions and benefit plan costs ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 131 ) ​ ​ ( 143 ) ​ ​ ( 332 ) ​ ​ ( 435 ) Non-reportable segments ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 220 ​ ​ 148 ​ ​ 547 ​ ​ 365 Net interest expense ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 143 ) ​ ​ ( 181 ) ​ ​ ( 437 ) ​ ​ ( 569 ) Share-based compensation (a) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 94 ) ​ ​ ( 83 ) ​ ​ ( 434 ) ​ ​ ( 396 ) Amortization of intangible assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 484 ) ​ ​ ( 544 ) ​ ​ ( 1,453 ) ​ ​ ( 1,690 ) Other, net (b) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 157 ) ​ ​ ( 376 ) ​ ​ ( 484 ) ​ ​ ( 827 ) Earnings from continuing operations before taxes ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 1,103 ​ $ 718 ​ $ 2,837 ​ $ 1,926 ​ ​ 20 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ​ Financial Review - Results of Operations ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are nutritional products, branded generic pharmaceuticals, diagnostic testing products and cardiovascular and neuromodulation products. ​ The following table details sales by reportable segment for the three months and nine months ended September 30. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Sales to External Customers ​ Three Months Three Months ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Ended ​ Ended ​ ​ ​ Impact of ​ Total Change ​ ​ September 30, ​ September 30, ​ Total ​ Foreign ​ Excl.

The increase in the Other category reflects growth in Abbott’s Diabetes Care business where sales in the first nine months of 2019 increased 30.6 percent in total and 36.5 percent, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, to $1.833 billion. The Diabetes Care sales growth was led by FreeStyle Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system with worldwide sales of $1.308 billion, which reflected an increase versus the prior year of 65.4 percent in total and 72.9 percent, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. ​ 21 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total net sales increased 7.4 percent in the third quarter of 2019 and 7.2 percent in the first nine months of 2019. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates during the period compared to 2018. The relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 3.0 percent and total sales by 1.9 percent in the third quarter of 2019. The relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 5.8 percent and total sales by 3.8 percent in the first nine months of 2019. ​ The table below provides detail by sales category for the nine months ended September 30.

Historic periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. ​ Key Emerging Markets for the Established Pharmaceutical Products business include India, Russia, Brazil and China, along with several other markets that represent the most attractive long-term growth opportunities for Abbott’s branded generics product portfolio. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in the Key Emerging Markets increased 7.4 percent compared to the first nine months of 2018 due to growth across several geographies including India, Russia, China and Brazil. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in Other Emerging Markets increased 3.7 percent compared to the first nine months of 2018. Sales growth in Other Emerging Markets was negatively impacted in the first nine months of 2019 by the discontinuation of a non-core, low-margin agreement under which Abbott supplied product to a third party. ​ The 4.8 percent increase in International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by growth in various countries in Asia and Latin America across Abbott’s portfolio, including PediaSure ® and Pedialyte ® . This growth was partially offset by challenging market dynamics in the Greater China infant category. In the U.S., the 2.2 percent increase in Pediatric Nutritional sales reflects growth in Pedialyte and PediaSure. The 10.6 percent increase in International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects continued growth of the Ensure ® and Glucerna ® brands in several countries. In the U.S. Adult Nutritional business, the decline reflects Abbott’s discontinuation of a non-core product line during the third quarter of 2018. ​ The 5.7 percent increase in Diagnostic Products sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by above-market growth in Core Laboratory in the U.S., and internationally where Abbott is achieving continued adoption of its Alinity ® family of diagnostic instruments. In July 2019, Abbott received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its Alinity blood and plasma screening system. The 7.0 percent decrease in Molecular sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects the negative impact of lower non-governmental organization purchases in Africa. In March 2019, Abbott announced that it obtained CE Mark for its Alinity molecular diagnostics system and several testing assays. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales growth in several areas, including cardio-metabolic testing, was mostly offset by lower than expected infectious disease testing sales in Africa. ​ 22 Table of Contents Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products sales grew 5.0 percent; the increase was driven by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure and Structural Heart. The growth in Electrophysiology reflects higher sales of cardiac diagnostic and ablation catheters in both the U.S. and internationally. In January 2019, Abbott announced U.S. FDA approval of its TactiCath ® contact force ablation catheter, Sensor Enabled™, which is designed to help physicians treat atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular heartbeat. ​ In Heart Failure, growth was driven by rapid market adoption in the U.S.of Abbott’s HeartMate 3 ® Left Ventricular Assist Device following FDA approval in October 2018 as a destination (long-term use) therapy for people living with advanced heart failure. In March 2019, Abbott announced new data from its MOMENTUM 3 clinical study, the largest randomized controlled trial to assess outcomes in patients receiving a heart pump to treat advanced heart failure, which demonstrated HeartMate 3 improved survival and clinical outcomes in this patient population. ​ Growth in Structural Heart was broad-based across several areas of the business, including MitraClip ® , Abbott's market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR), a leaky heart valve. During the first quarter of 2019, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for a new, expanded indication for MitraClip to treat clinically significant secondary MR as a result of underlying heart failure. This new indication expands the number of people with MR that can be treated with the MitraClip device. In July 2019, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval of the next generation of its MitraClip device, which includes a new leaflet grasping enhancement, an expanded range of clip sizes and facilitation of procedure assessment in real time to offer doctors further options when treating mitral valve disease. ​ In Vascular, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, revenues were basically flat as the 1.4 percent increase in coronary and endovascular product sales, which includes drug-eluting stents, balloon catheters, guidewires, vascular imaging/diagnostics products, vessel closure, carotid and other coronary and peripheral products, was offset primarily by a reduction in royalty revenue. In Rhythm Management, the 1.2 percent decline in revenues, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects a 6.3 percent decrease in U.S. sales partially offset by a 4.0 percent increase in international sales. The 4.3 percent decline in Neuromodulation sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects a 5.4 percent decline in U.S. sales. ​ The gross profit margin percentage was 52.4 percent for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 51.5 percent for the third quarter of 2018. The gross profit margin percentage was 52.3 percent for the first nine months of 2019 compared to 50.9 percent for the first nine months of 2018. The increase in the first nine months of 2019 primarily reflects the favorable comparison versus the prior year from lower intangible amortization expense, and integration and restructuring costs in 2019. ​ Research and development expenses increased by $22 million, or 3.7 percent, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased by $107 million, or 6.1 percent, in the first nine months of 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase in the third quarter of 2019 reflects higher R&D spending in various businesses and the acquisition of an R&D asset. The increase in R&D spending in the first nine months of 2019 primarily reflects higher spending on the acquisition of R&D assets. In the first quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc., Abbott acquired an R&D asset valued at $102 million, which was immediately expensed. During the first nine months of 2018, Abbott acquired R&D assets valued at $43 million, which were immediately expensed. The increase in R&D expense during the first nine months of 2019 was also driven by higher R&D spending in various businesses, including Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, research and development expenditures totaled $811 million for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment, $419 million for the Diagnostic Products segment, $142 million for the Nutritional Products segment and $137 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. ​ Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 2.7 percent in the third quarter and decreased 0.4 percent in first nine months of 2019. The increase in the quarter is primarily due to higher selling and marketing costs to drive continued growth across various businesses, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower acquisition-related integration costs. The decrease in the first nine months of 2019 is due primarily to the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower acquisition-related integration costs, partially offset by higher selling and marketing costs to drive continued growth across various businesses. ​ Restructuring Plans ​ The results for the first nine months of 2019 reflect charges under approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere or as part of various cost reduction programs. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $101 million in the first nine months of 2019 related to these initiatives, of which $28 million is recognized in Cost of products sold, $12 million is recognized in Research and development and $61 million is recognized in SG&A expense. See Note 7 to the financial statements, “Restructuring Plans,” for additional information regarding these charges. ​ 23 Table of Contents Other (Income) Expense, net ​ Other (income) expense, net totaled $55 million of income in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $18 million of expense in 2018 and $140 million of income in the first nine months of 2019 compared to $93 million of income in 2018. The change in Other (income) expense, net in the third quarter of 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the recording of an impairment of an investment in 2018. The increase in Other (income) expense, net in the first nine months of 2019 compared to 2018 was due to higher 2019 income related to the non-service cost component of the net periodic benefit associated with Abbott’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans and the 2018 investment impairment, partially offset by an unrealized gain on an investment in 2018 that resulted from an observable price change for a similar investment of the same issuer. ​ Interest Expense, net ​ Interest expense, net decreased $38 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $132 million in the first nine months of 2019 due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt refinancing in September 2018, as well as the repayment of debt in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019. ​ Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first nine months of 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include a $78 million reduction to the transition tax related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and approximately $95 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The $78 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in the first quarter. This adjustment decreased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.51 billion. In the first nine months of 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $80 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and a $53 million adjustment to the transition tax liability for associated effects related to state tax. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first nine months of 2018 reflect the recognition of $40 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years which decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by $47 million. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $185 million and $430 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2014 and the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources September 30, 2019 Compared with December 31, 2018 ​ The $247 million increase in cash and cash equivalents from $3.8 billion at December 31, 2018 to $4.1 billion at September 30, 2019 primarily reflects the favorable impact of cash generated by operating activities, partially offset by the payment of dividends, capital expenditures and the repayment of approximately $500 million of debt in the first nine months of 2019. Working capital was $5.6 billion at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. In 2019, increases in inventory, accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents were offset by an increase in the current portion of long-term debt related to debt that will mature in September 2020. ​ In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months of 2019 totaled $3.7 billion, a decrease of $815 million over the prior year due primarily to an increased investment in working capital, higher cash taxes paid and the timing of pension contributions in 2019 relative to 2017 and 2018, partially offset by higher operating earnings. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months of 2019 was a use of $523 million and includes the impact of the payment of cash taxes of approximately $775 million and $337 million of pension contributions, partially offset by payment timing for various accrued expenses. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months of 2018 of $608 million includes the favorable impact of improvements in working capital management, as well as the effect of non-cash charges related to the impairment of certain assets and the accrual of certain debt extinguishment costs. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first nine months of 2018 also includes $71 million of pension contributions as a pension contribution of $270 million was made in December 2017. Abbott expects to fund cash dividends, capital expenditures and its other investments in its businesses with cash flow from operating activities, cash on hand, short-term investments and borrowings. ​ 24 Table of Contents In September 2019, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. This bond redemption authorization supersedes the board’s previous authorization under which $700 million had not yet been redeemed. ​ At September 30, 2019, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2023. ​ In October 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. The new authorization is in addition to the $795 million unused portion of the previous share repurchase program that was authorized in September 2014. ​ On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale of up to $3 billion of common shares for general corporate purposes. No shares have been issued under this authorization. ​ In each of the first three quarters of 2019, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of approximately 14 percent over the $0.28 per share quarterly dividend declared in each of the first three quarters of 2018. ​ Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ​ In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. The new standard will be effective for Abbott at the beginning of 2020, with early adoption permitted. Abbott is currently assessing the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. ​ Lease Accounting Standard ​ In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which requires lessees to measure and recognize a lease asset and liability on the balance sheet for most leases, including operating leases. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and applied the standard’s transition provisions as of January 1, 2019. As a result, no changes were made to the December 31, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Abbott elected to apply the package of practical expedients related to transition. These practical expedients allowed Abbott to carry forward its historical assessments of whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for each lease existing at January 1, 2019, and whether any initial direct costs for such leases qualified for capitalization. ​ The new lease accounting standard does not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings but does have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of approximately $850 million of new right of use (ROU) assets and additional liabilities for operating leases on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019. ​ Legislative Issues ​ Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​ Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements ​ Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​ 25 Table of Contents PART I.

accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. ​ Note 2 — New Accounting Standards ​ Recently Adopted Accounting Standards ​ In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases , which requires lessees to measure and recognize a lease asset and liability on the balance sheet for most leases, including operating leases. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and applied the standard’s transition provisions as of January 1, 2019. As a result, no changes were made to the December 31, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Abbott elected to apply the package of practical expedients related to transition. These practical expedients allowed Abbott to carry forward its historical assessments of whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for each lease existing at January 1, 2019, and whether any initial direct costs for such leases qualified for capitalization. ​ The new lease accounting standard does not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings but does have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of approximately $ 850 million of new right of use (ROU) assets and additional liabilities for operating leases on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019. ​ Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ​ In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. The new standard will be effective for Abbott at the beginning of 2020, with early adoption permitted. Abbott is currently assessing the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. ​ Note 3 — Revenue ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products. Diabetes Care is a non-reportable segment and is included in Other. ​ 9 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Unaudited) ​ The following tables provide detail by sales category: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 ​ Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 853 ​ $ 853 ​ $ — ​ $ 866 ​ $ 866 Other ​ — ​ 255 ​ 255 ​ — ​ 263 ​ ​ 263 Total ​ — ​ 1,108 ​ 1,108 ​ — ​ 1,129 ​ 1,129 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 475 ​ 576 ​ 1,051 ​ 469 ​ 582 ​ 1,051 Adult Nutritionals ​ 311 ​ 513 ​ 824 ​ 312 ​ 495 ​ 807 Total ​ 786 ​ 1,089 ​ 1,875 ​ 781 ​ 1,077 ​ 1,858 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 272 ​ 897 ​ 1,169 ​ 248 ​ 880 ​ 1,128 Molecular ​ 38 ​ 69 ​ 107 ​ 38 ​ 84 ​ 122 Point of Care ​ 113 ​ 32 ​ 145 ​ 108 ​ 31 ​ 139 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 272 ​ 212 ​ 484 ​ 258 ​ 226 ​ 484 Total ​ 695 ​ 1,210 ​ 1,905 ​ 652 ​ 1,221 ​ 1,873 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 273 ​ 275 ​ 548 ​ 285 ​ 286 ​ 571 Electrophysiology ​ 190 ​ 240 ​ 430 ​ 170 ​ 230 ​ 400 Heart Failure ​ 149 ​ 52 ​ 201 ​ 117 ​ 46 ​ 163 Vascular ​ 270 ​ 460 ​ 730 ​ 284 ​ 466 ​ 750 Structural Heart ​ 152 ​ 200 ​ 352 ​ 118 ​ 197 ​ 315 Neuromodulation ​ 168 ​ 44 ​ 212 ​ 173 ​ 49 ​ 222 Total ​ 1,202 ​ 1,271 ​ 2,473 ​ 1,147 ​ 1,274 ​ 2,421 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 167 ​ 451 ​ 618 ​ 122 ​ 364 ​ 486 Total ​ $ 2,850 ​ $ 5,129 ​ $ 7,979 ​ $ 2,702 ​ $ 5,065 ​ $ 7,767 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 ​ Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 (in millions) U.S. Int’l Total U.S. Int’l Total Established Pharmaceutical Products — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Key Emerging Markets ​ $ — ​ $ 1,605 ​ $ 1,605 ​ $ — ​ $ 1,659 ​ $ 1,659 Other ​ — ​ 495 ​ 495 ​ — ​ 514 ​ ​ 514 Total ​ — ​ 2,100 ​ 2,100 ​ — ​ 2,173 ​ 2,173 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Nutritionals — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Pediatric Nutritionals ​ 928 ​ 1,152 ​ 2,080 ​ 917 ​ 1,128 ​ 2,045 Adult Nutritionals ​ 605 ​ 982 ​ 1,587 ​ 622 ​ 947 ​ 1,569 Total ​ 1,533 ​ 2,134 ​ 3,667 ​ 1,539 ​ 2,075 ​ 3,614 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Diagnostics — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Core Laboratory ​ 521 ​ 1,709 ​ 2,230 ​ 476 ​ 1,671 ​ 2,147 Molecular ​ 78 ​ 137 ​ 215 ​ 77 ​ 163 ​ 240 Point of Care ​ 222 ​ 58 ​ 280 ​ 218 ​ 62 ​ 280 Rapid Diagnostics ​ 598 ​ 423 ​ 1,021 ​ 581 ​ 462 ​ 1,043 Total ​ 1,419 ​ 2,327 ​ 3,746 ​ 1,352 ​ 2,358 ​ 3,710 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation — ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Rhythm Management ​ 525 ​ 537 ​ 1,062 ​ 571 ​ 563 ​ 1,134 Electrophysiology ​ 364 ​ 471 ​ 835 ​ 330 ​ 433 ​ 763 Heart Failure ​ 292 ​ 93 ​ 385 ​ 231 ​ 85 ​ 316 Vascular ​ 536 ​ 903 ​ 1,439 ​ 570 ​ 919 ​ 1,489 Structural Heart ​ 288 ​ 388 ​ 676 ​ 227 ​ 381 ​ 608 Neuromodulation ​ 320 ​ 85 ​ 405 ​ 341 ​ 93 ​ 434 Total ​ 2,325 ​ 2,477 ​ 4,802 ​ 2,270 ​ 2,474 ​ 4,744 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Other ​ 327 ​ 872 ​ 1,199 ​ 216 ​ 700 ​ 916 Total ​ $ 5,604 ​ $ 9,910 ​ $ 15,514 ​ $ 5,377 ​ $ 9,780 ​ $ 15,157 ​ Note: Insertable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) sales, which had previously been reported in Electrophysiology, are now included in Rhythm Management.

Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months , approximately 16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. ​ These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. ​ Other Contract Assets and Liabilities ​ Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at their net realizable value. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. ​ Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Contract Liabilities ​ ​ ​ Balance at December 31, 2018 ​ $ 259 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period ​ 201 Revenue recognized that was included in contract liability balance at beginning of period ​ ( 163 ) Balance at June 30, 2019 ​ $ 297 ​ ​ Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information ​ Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $ 1.0 billion and $ 714 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $ 1.668 billion and $ 1.121 billion, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $ 1.0 billion and $ 730 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $ 1.668 billion and $ 1.144 billion, respectively. ​ Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first six months of 2019 includes $ 326 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 615 million. The first six months of 2018 includes the payment of cash taxes of approximately $ 425 million. ​ The components of long-term investments as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ June 30, ​ December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 Long-term Investments: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Equity securities ​ $ 816 ​ $ 856 Other ​ ​ 35 ​ ​ 41 Total $ 851 $ 897 ​ ​ 11 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Unaudited) ​ Abbott's equity securities as of June 30, 2019, include approximately $ 320 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. ​ Abbott also holds certain investments as of June 30, 2019 with a carrying value of approximately $ 325 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $ 160 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The $ 160 million carrying value includes cumulative unrealized gains of approximately $ 50 million. ​ In the first quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc., Abbott acquired a research & development (R&D) asset valued at $ 102 million, which was immediately expensed. The $ 102 million of expense was recorded in the R&D line of Abbott's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. ​ Note 5 — Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ​ The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended June 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative ​ (Losses) on ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Actuarial ​ Unrealized Gains ​ Derivative ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ (Losses) and Prior ​ (Losses) on ​ Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Service (Costs) ​ Marketable Equity ​ Designated as (in millions) ​ Adjustments ​ and Credits ​ Securities ​ Cash Flow Hedges ​ 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Balance at March 31 ​ $ ( 4,790 ) ​ $ ( 3,119 ) ​ $ ( 2,703 ) ​ $ ( 2,498 ) ​ $ — ​ $ — ​ $ 23 ​ $ ( 116 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ 91 ​ ( 1,359 ) ​ ​ 3 ​ 30 ​ — ​ — ​ ( 2 ) ​ 81 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ — ​ 23 ​ 31 ​ — ​ — ​ ( 10 ) ​ 37 Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ 91 ​ ( 1,359 ) ​ 26 ​ 61 ​ — ​ — ​ ( 12 ) ​ 118 Balance at June 30 ​ $ ( 4,699 ) ​ $ ( 4,478 ) ​ $ ( 2,677 ) ​ $ ( 2,437 ) ​ $ — ​ $ — ​ $ 11 ​ $ 2 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Six Months Ended June 30 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative Gains ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cumulative ​ (Losses) on ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Actuarial ​ Unrealized Gains ​ Derivative ​ ​ Cumulative Foreign ​ (Losses) and Prior ​ (Losses) on ​ Instruments ​ ​ Currency Translation ​ Service (Costs) ​ Marketable Equity ​ Designated as (in millions) ​ Adjustments and Credits Securities Cash Flow Hedges ​ 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Balance at December 31 , 2018 and 2017 ​ $ ( 4,912 ) ​ $ ( 3,452 ) ​ $ ( 2,726 ) ​ $ ( 2,521 ) ​ $ — ​ $ ( 5 ) ​ $ 52 ​ $ ( 84 ) Impact of adoption of new accounting standard ​ ​ — ​ — ​ — ​ — ​ — ​ 5 ​ — ​ — Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications ​ 213 ​ ( 1,026 ) ​ 2 ​ 20 ​ — ​ — ​ ( 19 ) ​ 29 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ​ — ​ ​ — ​ 47 ​ 64 ​ — ​ — ​ ( 22 ) ​ 57 Net current period comprehensive income (loss) ​ 213 ​ ( 1,026 ) ​ 49 ​ 84 ​ — ​ — ​ ( 41 ) ​ 86 Balance at June 30 ​ $ ( 4,699 ) ​ $ ( 4,478 ) ​ $ ( 2,677 ) ​ $ ( 2,437 ) ​ $ — ​ $ — ​ $ 11 ​ $ 2 ​ Reclassified amounts for foreign currency translation are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as Net foreign exchange (gain) loss; gains (losses) on marketable equity securities as Other (income) expense, net and cash flow hedges as Cost of products sold.

The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at June 30, 2019 was $ 3.1 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $ 286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $ 3.7 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $ 15.3 billion for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first six months of 2019. ​ The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $ 25.6 billion as of June 30, 2019 and $ 25.7 billion as of December 31, 2018, and accumulated amortization was $ 11.1 billion as of June 30, 2019 and $ 10.4 billion as of December 31, 2018. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $ 2.0 billion in 2019, $ 2.1 billion in 2020, $ 2.0 billion in 2021, $ 2.0 billion in 2022 and $ 2.0 billion in 2023. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over 2 to 20 years (weighted average 12 years ). ​ Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development acquired in a business combination, were approximately $ 3.6 billion as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . ​ Note 7 — Restructuring Plans ​ From 2017 to 2019, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the cardiovascular and neuromodulation segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the diagnostics segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. In the first six months of 2019, charges of $ 36 million were recognized, of which $ 16 million is recorded in Cost of products sold, $ 2 million is recorded in Research and development and $ 18 million as Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for the first six months of 2019 related to these actions and the status of the related accrual as of June 30, 2019: ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2018 ​ $ 41 Restructuring charges recorded in 2019 ​ ​ 36 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 29 ) Accrued balance at June 30, 2019 ​ $ 48 ​ From 2016 to 2018, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses, including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. The following summarizes the activity for the first six months of 2019 related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accrual as of June 30, 2019: ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ Accrued balance at December 31, 2018 ​ $ 70 Payments and other adjustments ​ ​ ( 13 ) Accrued balance at June 30, 2019 ​ $ 57 ​ ​ Note 8 — Incentive Stock Programs ​ In the first six months of 2019, Abbott granted 4,501,185 stock options, 727,674 restricted stock awards and 6,483,388 restricted stock units under its incentive stock programs. At June 30, 2019, approximately 126 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2019 is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 30,784,257 ​ 21,173,966 Weighted average remaining life ( years ) 6.7 ​ 5.7 Weighted average exercise price $ 48.39 ​ $ 40.93 Aggregate intrinsic value ( in millions ) $ 1,099 ​ $ 914 ​ The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at June 30, 2019 amounted to approximately $ 585 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years . ​ 13 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Unaudited) ​ Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit ​ On February 24, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $ 500 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.80 % Notes due 2020. ​ In February 2018, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $ 5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. After the repayment of the 2.80 % Notes and other debt repayments that totaled $ 3.8 billion in 2018, approximately $ 700 million of the authorization remains available. ​ Note 10 – Leases ​ Leases where Abbott is the Lessee ​ Abbott has entered into operating leases as the lessee for office space, manufacturing facilities, R&D laboratories, warehouses, vehicles and equipment. Finance leases are not significant. Abbott’s operating leases generally have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 10 years . Some leases include options to extend beyond the original lease term, generally up to 10 years and some include options to terminate early. These options have been included in the determination of the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. ​ For all of its asset classes, Abbott elected the practical expedient allowed under FASB ASC No. 842, “Leases” to account for each lease component (e.g., the right to use office space) and the associated non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services) as a single lease component. Abbott also elected the short-term lease accounting policy for all asset classes; therefore, Abbott is not recognizing a lease liability or ROU asset for any lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that Abbott is reasonably certain to exercise. ​ As Abbott’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the interest rate used to determine the present value of the payments under each lease typically reflects Abbott’s incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. Abbott’s incremental borrowing rates at January 1, 2019 were used for operating leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019. ​ The following table provides information related to Abbott’s operating leases: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months Ended Six Months Ended (in millions) ​ June 30, 2019 ​ June 30, 2019 Operating lease cost (a) ​ $ 80 ​ $ 154 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities ​ $ 63 ​ $ 126 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ROU assets arising from obtaining new operating lease obligations ​ $ 63 ​ $ 97 ​ The weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate for operating leases as of June 30, 2019 were 8 years and 4.2 %, respectively. ​ Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of June 30, 2019 were as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) ​ ​ 2019 ​ $ 123 2020 ​ ​ 210 2021 ​ 158 2022 ​ 120 2023 ​ ​ 88 Thereafter ​ ​ 343 Total future minimum lease payments – undiscounted ​ 1,042 Less: imputed interest ​ ( 169 ) Present value of lease liabilities ​ $ 873 ​ ​ 14 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Unaudited) ​ The following table summarizes the amounts and location of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities as of June 30, 2019: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ (in millions) June 30, 2019 Balance Sheet Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Lease - ROU Asset ​ $ 850 Deferred income taxes and other assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Operating Lease Liability: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Current ​ $ 203 Other accrued liabilities Non-Current ​ ​ 670 Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Total Liability ​ $ 873 ​ Leases where Abbott is the Lessor ​ Certain assets, primarily Diagnostics instruments, are leased to customers under contractual arrangements that typically include an operating or sales-type lease as well as performance obligations for reagents and other consumables. Sales-type leases are not significant. Contract terms vary by customer and may include options to terminate the contract or options to extend the contract. Where instruments are provided under operating lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g. reagent) sales. The allocation of revenue between the lease and non-lease components is based on stand-alone selling prices. Operating lease revenue represented less than 3 percent of Abbott’s total net sales in the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. ​ Assets related to operating leases are reported within Net property and equipment on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $ 2.8 billion and $ 1.1 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2019. ​ Note 11 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures ​ Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $ 6.0 billion at June 30, 2019 and $ 5.1 billion at December 31, 2018 are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of June 30, 2019 on contracts related to intercompany purchases will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months . ​ Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Abbott held the gross notional amount of $ 10.5 billion and $ 13.6 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. ​ Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $ 2.9 billion at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount. ​ 15 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Unaudited) ​ The following table summarizes the amounts and location of certain derivative financial instruments as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Fair Value - Assets ​ Fair Value - Liabilities ​ ​ June 30, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ ​ June 30, ​ Dec. 31, ​ ​ (in millions) 2019 2018 Balance Sheet Caption 2019 2018 Balance Sheet Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 39 $ — Deferred income taxes and other assets $ — $ 100 Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreign currency forward exchange contracts: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Hedging instruments ​ 116 ​ 81 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 46 ​ 44 Other accrued liabilities Others not designated as hedges ​ 63 ​ 33 Prepaid expenses and other receivables ​ 33 ​ 51 Other accrued liabilities ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 218 $ 114 ​ ​ $ 79 $ 195 ​ ​ ​ The following table summarizes the activity for foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and certain other derivative financial instruments, as well as the amounts and location of income (expense) and gain (loss) reclassified into income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Gain (loss) Recognized in Other ​ Income (expense) and Gain (loss) ​ ​ ​ ​ Comprehensive Income (loss) ​ Reclassified into Income ​ ​ ​ ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ ​ ​ ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Income Statement (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Caption ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges ​ $ ( 2 ) ​ $ 113 ​ $ ( 21 ) ​ $ 27 ​ $ 17 ​ $ ( 53 ) ​ $ 32 ​ $ ( 83 ) ​ Cost of products sold ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges ​ n/a ​ n/a ​ ​ n/a ​ ​ n/a ​ 96 ​ ( 31 ) ​ ​ 139 ​ ​ ( 137 ) ​ Interest expense ​ Gains of $ 26 million and losses of $ 2 million were recognized in the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as a hedge.

Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $ 4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $ 10 million. ​ Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $ 90 million to $ 125 million. The recorded accrual balance at June 30, 2019 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $ 110 million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. ​ Note 13 — Post-Employment Benefits ​ Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized in continuing operations for the three and six months ended June 30 for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Defined Benefit Plans ​ Medical and Dental Plans ​ ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ Three Months ​ Six Months (in millions) ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Service cost - benefits earned during the period ​ $ 61 ​ $ 67 ​ $ 125 ​ $ 145 ​ $ 6 ​ $ 6 ​ $ 12 ​ $ 13 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations ​ 85 ​ 77 ​ 169 ​ 155 ​ 13 ​ 12 ​ 26 ​ 24 Expected return on plan assets ​ ( 178 ) ​ ( 171 ) ​ ( 356 ) ​ ( 342 ) ​ ( 7 ) ​ ( 8 ) ​ ( 14 ) ​ ( 16 ) Net amortization of: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Actuarial loss, net ​ 33 ​ 49 ​ 66 ​ 103 ​ 5 ​ 9 ​ 11 ​ 17 Prior service cost (credit) ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ 1 ​ ( 8 ) ​ ( 12 ) ​ ( 16 ) ​ ( 23 ) Net cost - continuing operations ​ $ 2 ​ $ 23 ​ $ 5 ​ $ 62 ​ $ 9 ​ $ 7 ​ $ 19 ​ $ 15 ​ Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to IRS funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first six months of 2019 and 2018, $ 326 million and $ 58 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans and $ 11 million was contributed to the post-employment medical and dental benefit plans in each year. ​ Note 14 — Taxes on Earnings ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first six months of 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include a $ 78 million reduction to the transition tax related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and approximately $ 90 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The $ 78 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in the first quarter. This adjustment decreased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $ 1.51 billion. In the first six months of 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $ 71 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and a $ 16 million adjustment to the transition tax liability for associated effects related to state tax. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first six months of 2018 reflect the recognition of $ 24 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years which decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by $ 31 million. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $ 185 million and $ 430 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In the U.S., ​ 18 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Unaudited) ​ Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2014 and the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. ​ Note 15 — Segment Information ​ Abbott’s principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. Abbott’s products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians’ offices and government agencies throughout the world. ​ Abbott’s reportable segments are as follows: ​ Established Pharmaceutical Products — International sales of a broad line of branded generic pharmaceutical products. ​ Nutritional Products — Worldwide sales of a broad line of adult and pediatric nutritional products. ​ Diagnostic Products — Worldwide sales of diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, physician offices and alternate-care testing sites.

For segment reporting purposes, the Cardiac Arrhythmias & Heart Failure, Vascular, Neuromodulation and Structural Heart divisions are aggregated and reported as the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation segment. ​ Non-reportable segments include Diabetes Care. ​ Abbott’s underlying accounting records are maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting requirements. Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. Intersegment transfers of inventory are recorded at standard cost and are not a measure of segment operating earnings. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment’s assets. ​ The following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements. ​ 19 Table of Contents ​ Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 (Unaudited) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net Sales to External Customers ​ Operating Earnings ​ ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ Three Months ​ Six Months ​ ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 ​ Ended June 30 (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Established Pharmaceutical Products ​ $ 1,108 ​ $ 1,129 ​ $ 2,100 ​ $ 2,173 ​ $ 214 ​ $ 208 ​ $ 373 ​ $ 375 Nutritional Products ​ 1,875 ​ 1,858 ​ 3,667 ​ 3,614 ​ 447 ​ 424 ​ 827 ​ 789 Diagnostic Products ​ 1,905 ​ 1,873 ​ 3,746 ​ 3,710 ​ 466 ​ 489 ​ 900 ​ 932 Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products ​ 2,473 ​ 2,421 ​ 4,802 ​ 4,744 ​ 744 ​ 761 ​ 1,438 ​ 1,485 Total Reportable Segments ​ 7,361 ​ 7,281 ​ 14,315 ​ 14,241 ​ 1,871 ​ 1,882 ​ 3,538 ​ ​ 3,581 Other ​ 618 ​ 486 ​ 1,199 ​ 916 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Net sales ​ $ 7,979 ​ $ 7,767 ​ $ 15,514 ​ $ 15,157 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Corporate functions and benefit plans costs ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 99 ) ​ ​ ( 140 ) ​ ​ ( 201 ) ​ ​ ( 292 ) Non-reportable segments ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 173 ​ ​ 125 ​ ​ 327 ​ ​ 217 Net interest expense ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 146 ) ​ ​ ( 189 ) ​ ​ ( 294 ) ​ ​ ( 388 ) Share-based compensation (a) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 114 ) ​ ​ ( 101 ) ​ ​ ( 340 ) ​ ​ ( 313 ) Amortization of intangible assets ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 483 ) ​ ​ ( 562 ) ​ ​ ( 969 ) ​ ​ ( 1,146 ) Other, net (b) ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ( 100 ) ​ ​ ( 238 ) ​ ​ ( 327 ) ​ ​ ( 451 ) Earnings from continuing operations before taxes ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 1,102 ​ $ 777 ​ $ 1,734 ​ $ 1,208 ​ ​ ​ ​ 20 Table of Contents ​ Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ​ Financial Review - Results of Operations ​ Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are nutritional products, branded generic pharmaceuticals, diagnostic testing products and cardiovascular and neuromodulation products. ​ The following table details sales by reportable segment for the three months and six months ended June 30.

The increase in the Other category reflects growth in Abbott’s Diabetes Care business where sales in the first six months of 2019 increased 31.2 percent in total and 38.4 percent, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, to $1.168 billion. The Diabetes Care sales growth was led by FreeStyle ® Libre ® , Abbott’s continuous glucose monitoring system with worldwide sales of $812 million, which reflected an increase versus the prior year of 66.8 percent in total and 76.2 percent, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. ​ 21 Table of Contents ​ Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total net sales increased 7.3 percent in the second quarter of 2019 and 7.1 percent in the first six months of 2019. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates during the period compared to 2018. The relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 7.0 percent and total sales by 4.6 percent in the second quarter of 2019. The relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 7.3 percent and total sales by 4.7 percent in the first six months of 2019. ​ The table below provides detail by sales category for the six months ended June 30.

Historic periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. ​ Key Emerging Markets for the Established Pharmaceutical Products business include India, Russia, Brazil and China, along with several other markets that represent the most attractive long-term growth opportunities for Abbott’s branded generics product portfolio. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in the Key Emerging Markets increased 7.6 percent compared to the first six months of 2018 due to growth across several geographies including India, Russia and China. Sales growth in Other Emerging Markets was negatively impacted in the first six months of 2019 by the discontinuation of a non-core, low-margin agreement under which Abbott supplied product to a third party. ​ The 7.6 percent increase in International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by broad-based growth in Asia and Latin America across Abbott’s portfolio, including Similac ® and PediaSure ® . In the U.S., the 1.2 percent increase in Pediatric Nutritional sales reflects growth in Pedialyte ® and PediaSure. The 10.7 percent increase in International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects continued growth of the Ensure ® and Glucerna ® brands in several countries. In the U.S. Adult Nutritional business, the decline reflects Abbott’s discontinuation of a non-core product line during the third quarter of 2018. ​ The 5.3 percent increase in Diagnostic Products sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was driven by above-market growth in Core Laboratory in the U.S., and internationally where Abbott is achieving continued adoption of its Alinity ® family of diagnostic instruments. In July 2019, Abbott received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its Alinity blood and plasma screening system. The 7.3 percent decrease in Molecular sales excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects the negative impact in the quarter of certain non-governmental organization (NGO) purchasing patterns in Africa. In March 2019, Abbott announced that it obtained CE Mark for its Alinity molecular diagnostics system and several testing assays. ​ 22 Table of Contents ​ In Rapid Diagnostics, sales growth in several areas, including cardio-metabolic testing, was mostly offset by the negative impact in 2019 of certain NGO purchasing patterns in Africa and an unfavorable comparison versus the first six months of 2018 when sales were higher due to a stronger flu season. ​ Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products sales grew 4.6 percent; the increase was driven by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure and Structural Heart. The growth in Electrophysiology reflects higher sales in both the U.S. and internationally. In January 2019, Abbott announced U.S. FDA approval of its TactiCath ® contact force ablation catheter, Sensor Enabled™, which is designed to help physicians treat atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular heartbeat. ​ In Heart Failure, growth was driven by rapid market adoption in the U.S.of Abbott’s HeartMate 3 ® Left Ventricular Assist Device following FDA approval in October 2018 as a destination (long-term use) therapy for people living with advanced heart failure. In March 2019, Abbott announced new data from its MOMENTUM 3 clinical study, the largest randomized controlled trial to assess outcomes in patients receiving a heart pump to treat advanced heart failure, which demonstrated HeartMate 3 improved survival and clinical outcomes in this patient population. ​ Growth in Structural Heart was broad-based across several areas of the business, including MitraClip ® , Abbott’s market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR), a leaky heart valve. During the first quarter of 2019, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for a new, expanded indication for MitraClip to treat clinically significant secondary MR as a result of underlying heart failure. This new indication expands the number of people with MR that can be treated with the MitraClip device. In July 2019, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval of the next generation of its MitraClip device which includes a new leaflet grasping enhancement and an expanded range of clip sizes. ​ In Vascular, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, revenues were basically flat as the 2.1 percent increase in coronary and endovascular product sales, which includes drug-eluting stents, balloon catheters, guidewires, vascular imaging/diagnostics products, vessel closure, carotid and other coronary and peripheral products, was offset primarily by a reduction in royalty revenue. In Rhythm Management, the 3.0 percent decline in revenues, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects an 8.3 percent decrease in U.S. sales partially offset by a 2.4 percent increase in international sales. The 5.0 percent decline in Neuromodulation sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects a 6.2 percent decline in U.S. sales and a 0.6 percent decline in international sales. ​ The gross profit margin percentage was 52.8 percent for the second quarter of 2019 compared to 50.5 percent for the second quarter of 2018. The gross profit margin percentage was 52.3 percent for the first six months of 2019 compared to 50.6 percent for the first six months of 2018. The increase primarily reflects the favorable comparison versus the prior year from lower intangible amortization expense and restructuring costs in 2019. ​ Research and development expenses were essentially unchanged in the second quarter of 2019 and increased by $85 million, or 7.3 percent, in the first six months of 2019 compared to the prior year. In the second quarter of 2019, higher R&D spending in various businesses was offset by the effect of favorable foreign exchange and a decrease in costs related to acquired R&D assets compared to 2018. The increase in R&D spending in the first six months of 2019 primarily reflects higher spending on the acquisition of R&D assets. In the first quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc., Abbott acquired an R&D asset valued at $102 million, which was immediately expensed. During the first six months of 2018, Abbott acquired R&D assets valued at $43 million, which were immediately expensed. The increase in R&D expense during the first six months of 2019 was also driven by higher R&D spending in various businesses, including Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, research and development expenditures totaled $532 million for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment, $287 million for the Diagnostic Products segment, $92 million for the Nutritional Products segment and $91 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. ​ Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 decreased 1.3 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, due primarily to lower acquisition-related integration costs and the favorable effect of foreign exchange on SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher selling and marketing costs to drive continued growth across various businesses. ​ Restructuring Plans ​ The results for the first six months of 2019 reflect charges under approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $36 million in the first six months of 2019 related to these initiatives, of which $16 million is recognized in Cost of products sold, $2 million is recognized in Research and development and $18 million is recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense. See Note 7 to the financial statements, “Restructuring Plans,” for additional information regarding these charges. ​ 23 Table of Contents ​ Other (Income) Expense, net ​ Other (income) expense, net decreased by $40 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2018 and decreased by $26 million in the first six months of 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease in other income in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to the recording of an unrealized gain on an investment in 2018 of approximately $50 million that resulted from an observable price change for a similar investment of the same issuer. The decrease in other income in the first six months of 2019 compared to 2018 was due to this 2018 unrealized gain, along with the impairment of certain equity investments in 2019, partially offset by higher 2019 income related to the non-service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost associated with Abbott’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans. ​ Interest Expense, net ​ Interest expense, net decreased $43 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $94 million in the first six months of 2019 due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the favorable impact of the euro debt refinancing in September 2018 as well as the repayment of debt in 2018. ​ Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations ​ Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first six months of 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include a $78 million reduction to the transition tax related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and approximately $90 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The $78 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in the first quarter. This adjustment decreased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.51 billion. In the first six months of 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $71 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and a $16 million adjustment to the transition tax liability for associated effects related to state tax. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first six months of 2018 reflect the recognition of $24 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years which decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by $31 million. ​ Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott’s income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $185 million and $430 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In the U.S., Abbott’s federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2014 and the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. ​ Liquidity and Capital Resources June 30, 2019 Compared with December 31, 2018 ​ The reduction of cash and cash equivalents from $3.8 billion at December 31, 2018 to $3.1 billion at June 30, 2019 primarily reflects repayment of $500 million of debt, the payment of dividends and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash generated from operations in the first six months of 2019. Working capital was $6.1 billion at June 30, 2019 and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2018. The $500 million increase in working capital in 2019 primarily reflects an increase in inventory and accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in cash. ​ In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2019 totaled $1.8 billion, a decrease of $580 million over the prior year due primarily to the timing of $326 million of pension contributions in 2019, an increased investment in working capital and higher cash taxes paid partially offset by higher operating earnings. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2019 was a use of $875 million and includes $326 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $615 million. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2018 was a use of $373 million and includes the impact of approximately $425 million of cash taxes paid. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2018 also includes $58 million of pension contributions as a pension contribution of $270 million was made in December 2017. ​ On February 16, 2018, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5.0 billion of outstanding long-term notes. Redemptions under this authorization total $4.3 billion, including the redemption of the $500 million outstanding principal amount of the 2.80% Notes due 2020 on February 24, 2019. Approximately $700 million of the $5.0 billion debt redemption authorization remains available. ​ 24 Table of Contents ​ At June 30, 2019, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and A3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2023. ​ In September 2014, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of Abbott’s common shares from time to time. Under the program authorized in 2014, Abbott repurchased 36.2 million shares at a cost of $1.7 billion in 2015, 10.4 million shares at a cost of $408 million in 2016 and 1.9 million shares at a cost of $130 million in 2018 for a total of approximately $2.2 billion. ​ On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale of up to $3 billion of common shares for general corporate purposes. No shares have been issued under this authorization. ​ In each of the first two quarters of 2019, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of approximately 14 percent over the $0.28 per share quarterly dividend declared in each of the first two quarters of 2018. ​ Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted ​ In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. The new standard will be effective for Abbott at the beginning of 2020, with early adoption permitted. Abbott is currently assessing the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. ​ Lease Accounting Standard ​ In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which requires lessees to measure and recognize a lease asset and liability on the balance sheet for most leases, including operating leases. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and applied the standard’s transition provisions as of January 1, 2019. As a result, no changes were made to the December 31, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Abbott elected to apply the package of practical expedients related to transition. These practical expedients allowed Abbott to carry forward its historical assessments of whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for each lease existing at January 1, 2019, and whether any initial direct costs for such leases qualified for capitalization. ​ The new lease accounting standard does not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings but does have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of approximately $850 million of new right of use (ROU) assets and additional liabilities for operating leases on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019. ​ Legislative Issues ​ Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​ Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements ​ Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott’s operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​ 25 Table of Contents ​ PART I.

However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbotts Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions. Note 2  New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases , which requires lessees to measure and recognize a lease asset and liability on the balance sheet for most leases, including operating leases. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and applied the standards transition provisions as of January 1, 2019. As a result, no changes were made to the December 31, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Abbott elected to apply the package of practical expedients related to transition. These practical expedients allowed Abbott to carry forward its historical assessments of whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for each lease existing at January 1, 2019, and whether any initial direct costs for such leases qualified for capitalization. The new lease accounting standard does not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings but does have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of approximately $850 million of new right of use (ROU) assets and additional liabilities for operating leases on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019. Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments  Credit Losses which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. The new standard will be effective for Abbott at the beginning of 2020, with early adoption permitted. Abbott is currently assessing the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. Note 3  Revenue Abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products. Diabetes Care is a non-reportable segment and is included in Other. 8 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2019 (Unaudited) The following table provides revenues by sales category: Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 (in millions) U.S. Intl Total U.S. Intl Total Established Pharmaceutical Products  Key Emerging Markets $  $ 752 $ 752 $  $ 793 $ 793 Other  240 240  251 251 Total  992 992  1,044 1,044 Nutritionals  Pediatric Nutritionals 453 576 1,029 448 546 994 Adult Nutritionals 294 469 763 310 452 762 Total 747 1,045 1,792 758 998 1,756 Diagnostics  Core Laboratory 249 812 1,061 228 791 1,019 Molecular 40 68 108 39 79 118 Point of Care 109 26 135 110 31 141 Rapid Diagnostics 326 211 537 323 236 559 Total 724 1,117 1,841 700 1,137 1,837 Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation  Rhythm Management 233 257 490 264 271 535 Electrophysiology 193 236 429 182 209 391 Heart Failure 143 41 184 114 39 153 Vascular 266 443 709 286 453 739 Structural Heart 136 188 324 109 184 293 Neuromodulation 152 41 193 168 44 212 Total 1,123 1,206 2,329 1,123 1,200 2,323 Other 160 421 581 94 336 430 Total $ 2,754 $ 4,781 $ 7,535 $ 2,675 $ 4,715 $ 7,390 Remaining Performance Obligations As of March 31, 2019, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was approximately $3.0 billion in the Diagnostics segment and approximately $390 million in the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately 60 percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months, approximately 16 percent over the subsequent 12 months and the remainder thereafter. These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above. Other Contract Assets and Liabilities Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at their net realizable value. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbotts conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant. Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbotts contract liabilities arise primarily in the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation reportable segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements. 9 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2019 (Unaudited) Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows: (in millions) Contract Liabilities Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 259 Unearned revenue from cash received during the period 109 Revenue recognized that was included in contract liability balance at beginning of period (86 ) Balance at March 31, 2019 $ 282 Note 4  Supplemental Financial Information Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Earnings from Continuing Operations allocated to common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $668 million and $406 million, respectively. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $668 million and $415 million, respectively. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first three months of 2019 includes $313 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $185 million. The first three months of 2018 includes the payment of cash taxes of approximately $220 million. The components of long-term investments as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are as follows: Long-term Investments March 31, December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 Equity securities $ 832 $ 856 Other 35 41 Total $ 867 $ 897 Abbotts equity securities as of March 31, 2019, include approximately $328 million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust and were acquired as part of the St. Jude Medical, Inc. (St. Jude Medical) business acquisition. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency. Abbott also holds certain investments as of March 31, 2019 with a carrying value of approximately $325 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of approximately $170 million that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The $170 million carrying value includes cumulative unrealized gains of approximately $50 million. In the first quarter of 2019, in conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc., Abbott acquired a research & development (R&D) asset valued at $102 million, which was immediately expensed. The $102 million of expense was recorded in the R&D line of Abbotts Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 10 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2019 (Unaudited) Note 5  Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows: Three Months Ended March 31 Cumulative Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Net Actuarial (Losses) and Prior Service (Costs) and Credits Cumulative Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Marketable Equity Securities Cumulative Gains (Losses) on Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Balance at December 31 $ (4,912 ) $ (3,452 ) $ (2,726 ) $ (2,521 ) $  $ (5 ) $ 52 $ (84 ) Impact of adoption of new accounting standard      5   Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 122 333 (1 ) (10 )   (17 ) (52 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income   24 33   (12 ) 20 Net current period comprehensive income (loss) 122 333 23 23   (29 ) (32 ) Balance at March 31 $ (4,790 ) $ (3,119 ) $ (2,703 ) $ (2,498 ) $  $  $ 23 $ (116 ) Reclassified amounts for foreign currency translation are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings as Net foreign exchange (gain) loss; and amounts for cash flow hedges are recorded as Cost of products sold. Net actuarial losses and prior service cost are included as a component of net periodic benefit costs; see Note 13 for additional details. Note 6  Goodwill and Intangible Assets The total amount of goodwill reported was $23.2 billion at March 31, 2019 and $23.3 billion at December 31, 2018. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by approximately $45 million in the first three months of 2019. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at March 31, 2019 was $3.0 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $3.7 billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $15.2 billion for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment. There was no reduction of goodwill relating to impairments in the first three months of 2019. The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology was $25.7 billion as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and accumulated amortization was $10.8 billion as of March 31, 2019 and $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2018. Foreign currency translation adjustments increased intangible assets by $16 million in the first three months of 2019. Abbotts estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $2.0 billion in 2019, $2.2 billion in 2020, $2.1 billion in 2021, $2.0 billion in 2022 and $2.0 billion in 2023. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over 2 to 20 years (weighted average 12 years). Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process R&D acquired in a business combination, were approximately $3.6 billion as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Note 7  Restructuring Plans From 2017 to 2019, Abbott management approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical into the cardiovascular and neuromodulation segment, and Alere Inc. (Alere) into the diagnostics segment, in order to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. In the first three months of 2019, charges of $35 million were recognized, of which $16 million is recorded in Cost of products sold, $2 million is recorded in Research and development and $17 million as Selling, general and administrative expense. The following summarizes the activity for the first three months of 2019 related to these actions and the status of the related accrual as of March 31, 2019: (in millions) Accrued balance at December 31, 2018 $ 41 Restructuring charges recorded in 2019 35 Payments and other adjustments (15 ) Accrued balance at March 31, 2019 $ 61 11 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2019 (Unaudited) From 2016 to 2018, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in various Abbott businesses including the nutritional, established pharmaceuticals and vascular businesses. The following summarizes the activity for the first three months of 2019 related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accrual as of March 31, 2019: (in millions) Accrued balance at December 31, 2018 $ 70 Payments and other adjustments (8 ) Accrued balance at March 31, 2019 $ 62 Note 8  Incentive Stock Programs In the first three months of 2019, Abbott granted 4,010,886 stock options, 663,273 restricted stock awards and 6,295,318 restricted stock units under its incentive stock programs. At March 31, 2019, approximately 126 million shares were reserved for future grants. Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at March 31, 2019 is as follows: Outstanding Exercisable Number of shares 33,426,839 24,138,209 Weighted average remaining life ( years ) 6.7 5.9 Weighted average exercise price $ 47.05 $ 40.52 Aggregate intrinsic value ( in millions ) $ 1,099 $ 952 The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at March 31, 2019 amounted to approximately $663 million which is expected to be recognized over the next three years. Note 9  Debt and Lines of Credit On February 24, 2019, Abbott redeemed the $500 million outstanding principal amount of its 2.80% Notes due 2020. In February 2018, the board of directors had authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. After the repayment of the 2.80% Notes and other debt repayments that totaled $3.8 billion in 2018, approximately $700 million of the authorization remains available. Note 10  Leases Leases where Abbott is the Lessee Abbott has entered into operating leases as the lessee for office space, manufacturing facilities, R&D laboratories, warehouses, vehicles and equipment. Finance leases are not significant. Abbotts operating leases generally have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 10 years. Some leases include options to extend beyond the original lease term, generally up to 10 years and some include options to terminate early. These options have been included in the determination of the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. For all of its asset classes Abbott elected the practical expedient allowed under FASB ASC No. 842, Leases to account for each lease component (e.g., the right to use office space) and the associated non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services) as a single lease component. Abbott also elected the short-term lease accounting policy for all asset classes; therefore, Abbott is not recognizing a lease liability or ROU asset for any lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that Abbott is reasonably certain to exercise. As Abbotts leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the interest rate used to determine the present value of the payments under each lease typically reflects Abbotts incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. Abbotts incremental borrowing rates at January 1, 2019 were used for operating leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019. 12 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2019 (Unaudited) The following table provides information related to Abbotts operating leases: Three Months Ended (in millions) March 31, 2019 Operating lease cost (a) $ 74 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 63 ROU assets arising from obtaining new operating lease obligations $ 34 Weighted average remaining lease term  operating leases 8 years Weighted average discount rate  operating leases 4.2 % (a) Includes short-term lease expense and variable lease costs, which were immaterial in the quarter. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of March 31, 2019 were as follows: (in millions) 2019 $ 174 2020 191 2021 142 2022 111 2023 83 Thereafter 318 Total future minimum lease payments  undiscounted 1,019 Less: imputed interest (168 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 851 The following table summarizes the amounts and location of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities as of March 31, 2019: (in millions) March 31, 2019 Balance Sheet Caption Operating Lease - ROU Asset $ 833 Deferred income taxes and other assets Operating Lease Liability: Current $ 196 Other accrued liabilities Non-Current 655 Post-employment obligations, deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities Total Liability $ 851 Leases where Abbott is the Lessor Certain assets, primarily Diagnostics instruments, are leased to customers under contractual arrangements that typically include an operating or sales-type lease as well as performance obligations for reagents and other consumables. Sales-type leases are not significant. Contract terms vary by customer and may include options to terminate the contract or options to extend the contract. Where instruments are provided under operating lease arrangements, some portion or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent non-lease component (e.g. reagent) sales. The allocation of revenue between the lease and non-lease components is based on stand-alone selling prices. Operating lease revenue represented less than 3 percent of Abbotts total net sales in the first quarter of 2019. Assets related to operating leases are reported within Net property and equipment on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The original cost and the net book value of such assets were $2.8 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as of March 31, 2019. 13 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2019 (Unaudited) Note 11  Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $5.4 billion at March 31, 2019 and $5.1 billion at December 31, 2018 are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of March 31, 2019 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next twelve to eighteen months. Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, Abbott held the gross notional amount of $10.6 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively, of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts totaling approximately $2.9 billion at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.

The hedged debt is marked to market, offsetting the effect of marking the interest rate swaps to market. The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are shown in the following table. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions. Abbott does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.

The fair value of debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. Note 12  Litigation and Environmental Matters Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $4 million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $10 million. Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $95 million to $140 million. The recorded accrual balance at March 31, 2019 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $115 million. This accrual represents managements best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, Contingencies. Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbotts financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Note 13  Post-Employment Benefits Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Net cost recognized in continuing operations for the three months ended March 31 for Abbotts major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans is as follows: Defined Benefit Plans Medical and Dental Plans (in millions) March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018 March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018 Service cost - benefits earned during the period $ 64 $ 78 $ 6 $ 7 Interest cost on projected benefit obligations 84 78 13 12 Expected return on plan assets (178 ) (171 ) (7 ) (8 ) Net amortization of: Actuarial loss, net 33 54 6 8 Prior service cost (credit)   (8 ) (11 ) Net cost  continuing operations $ 3 $ 39 $ 10 $ 8 Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to IRS funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first three months of 2019 and 2018, $313 million and $14 million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans and $11 million was contributed to the post-employment medical and dental benefit plans in each year. Note 14  Taxes on Earnings Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include a $78 million reduction to the transition tax related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and approximately $65 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The $78 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in the quarter. This adjustment decreased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.51 billion. In the first three months of 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $65 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and a $15 million adjustment to the transition tax liability for associated effects related to state tax. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first three months of 2018 reflect the recognition of $9 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years which decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by $16 million. 16 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2019 (Unaudited) Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbotts income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $185 million and $430 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In the U.S., Abbotts federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2014 and the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. Note 15  Segment Information Abbotts principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products. Abbotts products are generally sold directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians offices and government agencies throughout the world. Abbotts reportable segments are as follows: Established Pharmaceutical Products  International sales of a broad line of branded generic pharmaceutical products. Nutritional Products  Worldwide sales of a broad line of adult and pediatric nutritional products. Diagnostic Products  Worldwide sales of diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, physician offices and alternate-care testing sites. For segment reporting purposes, the Core Laboratories Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics divisions are aggregated and reported as the Diagnostic Products segment. Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products  Worldwide sales of cardiac rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular, structural heart and neuromodulation products. For segment reporting purposes, the Cardiac Arrhythmias & Heart Failure, Vascular, Neuromodulation and Structural Heart divisions are aggregated and reported as the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation segment. Non-reportable segments includes Diabetes Care. Abbotts underlying accounting records are maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting requirements. Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. Intersegment transfers of inventory are recorded at standard cost and are not a measure of segment operating earnings. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segments assets. The following segment information has been prepared in accordance with the internal accounting policies of Abbott, as described above, and is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied to the consolidated financial statements. 17 Table of Contents Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements March 31, 2019 (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31 Net Sales to External Customers Operating Earnings (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Established Pharmaceutical Products $ 992 $ 1,044 $ 159 $ 167 Nutritional Products 1,792 1,756 380 365 Diagnostic Products 1,841 1,837 434 443 Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products 2,329 2,323 694 724 Total Reportable Segments 6,954 6,960 1,667 1,699 Other 581 430 Net sales $ 7,535 $ 7,390 Corporate functions and benefit plans costs (102 ) (152 ) Non-reportable segments 154 92 Net interest expense (148 ) (199 ) Share-based compensation (a) (226 ) (212 ) Amortization of intangible assets (486 ) (584 ) Other, net (b) (227 ) (213 ) Earnings from continuing operations before taxes $ 632 $ 431 (a) Approximately 50 percent of the annual net cost of share-based awards will typically be recognized in the first quarter due to the timing of the granting of share-based awards.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Review - Results of Operations Abbotts revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbotts products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbotts primary products are nutritional products, branded generic pharmaceuticals, diagnostic testing products and cardiovascular and neuromodulation products. The following table details sales by reportable segment for the three months ended March 31. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. Net Sales to External Customers (in millions) Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Total Change Impact of Foreign Exchange Total Change Excl. Foreign Exchange Established Pharmaceutical Products $ 992 $ 1,044 (4.9 )% (10.3 )% 5.4 % Nutritional Products 1,792 1,756 2.0 (3.7 ) 5.7 Diagnostic Products 1,841 1,837 0.2 (4.2 ) 4.4 Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products 2,329 2,323 0.2 (3.4 ) 3.6 Total Reportable Segments 6,954 6,960 (0.1 ) (4.7 ) 4.6 Other 581 430 35.4 (7.4 ) 42.8 Net sales $ 7,535 $ 7,390 2.0 (4.8 ) 6.8 Total U.S. $ 2,754 $ 2,675 2.9  2.9 Total International $ 4,781 $ 4,715 1.4 (7.6 ) 9.0 Note: In order to compute results excluding the impact of exchange rates, current year U.S. dollar sales are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided, as appropriate, by the prior year average foreign exchange rates. Net sales growth in 2019, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was driven by growth in all of Abbotts businesses. The increase in the Other category reflects growth in Abbotts Diabetes Care business where sales in the first three months of 2019 increased 34.4 percent in total and 42.0 percent, excluding the effects of foreign exchange, to $566 million. The Diabetes Care sales growth was led by FreeStyle ® Libre ® , Abbotts continuous glucose monitoring system with worldwide sales of $379 million, which reflected an increase versus the prior year of 70.2 percent in total and 80.1 percent, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total net sales increased 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2019. Abbotts net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first quarter as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 7.6 percent and total sales by 4.8 percent. 19 Table of Contents The table below provides detail by sales category for the three months ended March 31. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers. (in millions) March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018 Total Change Impact of Foreign Exchange Total Change Excl. Foreign Exchange Established Pharmaceutical Products  Key Emerging Markets $ 752 $ 793 (5.2 )% (12.5 )% 7.3 % Other Emerging Markets 240 251 (4.2 ) (3.3 ) (0.9 ) Nutritionals  International Pediatric Nutritionals 576 546 5.4 (5.8 ) 11.2 U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals 453 448 1.2  1.2 International Adult Nutritionals 469 452 3.9 (7.2 ) 11.1 U.S. Adult Nutritionals 294 310 (5.5 )  (5.5 ) Diagnostics  Core Laboratory 1,061 1,019 4.1 (5.8 ) 9.9 Molecular 108 118 (8.4 ) (3.3 ) (5.1 ) Point of Care 135 141 (4.8 ) (0.6 ) (4.2 ) Rapid Diagnostics 537 559 (4.0 ) (2.6 ) (1.4 ) Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation  Rhythm Management 490 535 (8.5 ) (3.3 ) (5.2 ) Electrophysiology 429 391 9.8 (3.3 ) 13.1 Heart Failure 184 153 20.9 (1.7 ) 22.6 Vascular (a) 709 739 (4.1 ) (3.7 ) (0.4 ) Structural Heart 324 293 10.3 (4.7 ) 15.0 Neuromodulation 193 212 (8.9 ) (1.8 ) (7.1 ) (a) Vascular Product Lines: Coronary and Endovascular 675 691 (2.3 ) (3.9 ) 1.6 Key Emerging Markets for the Established Pharmaceutical Products business include India, Russia, Brazil and China, along with several other markets that represent the most attractive long-term growth opportunities for Abbotts branded generics product portfolio. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in the Key Emerging Markets increased 7.3 percent compared to the first three months of 2018 due to growth across several geographies including Russia and China. Sales growth in Other Emerging Markets was negatively impacted in the first three months of 2019 by the recent discontinuation of a non-core, low-margin agreement under which Abbott supplied product to a third party. The 11.2 percent increase in International Pediatric Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was primarily driven by broad-based growth in Asia and Latin America across Abbotts portfolio, including Similac ® and PediaSure ® . In the U.S., the 1.2 percent increase in Pediatric Nutritional sales reflects growth in Pedialyte ® and PediaSure. The 11.1 percent increase in International Adult Nutritional sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects continued growth of the Ensure ® and Glucerna ® brands in various countries. In the U.S. Adult Nutritional business, the decline reflects Abbotts discontinuation of a non-core product line during the third quarter of 2018. The 4.4 percent increase in Diagnostics sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, was primarily driven by above-market growth in Core Laboratory in the U.S., and internationally where Abbott is achieving continued adoption of its Alinity ® family of diagnostic instruments. The 5.1 percent decrease in Molecular Diagnostics sales excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects the negative impact in the quarter of certain non-governmental organization (NGO) purchasing patterns in Africa. During the quarter, Abbott obtained CE Mark for its Alinity m (molecular) diagnostics system and several testing assays. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales growth in several areas, including double-digit growth in cardio-metabolic testing and Abbotts ID-NOW TM infectious disease testing platform, was more than offset by the negative impact in 2019 of certain NGO purchasing patterns in Africa and an unfavorable comparison versus the first three months of 2018 when sales were higher due to a stronger flu season. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products sales grew 3.6 percent; the increase was driven by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure and Structural Heart. The growth in Electrophysiology reflects higher sales in both the U.S. and internationally. In January 2019, Abbott announced U.S. FDA approval of its TactiCath ® contact force ablation catheter, Sensor Enabled, which is designed to help physicians treat atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular heartbeat. 20 Table of Contents In Heart Failure, growth was driven by rapid U.S. market adoption of Abbotts HeartMate 3 ® Left Ventricular Assist Device following FDA approval in October 2018 as a destination (long-term use) therapy for people living with advanced heart failure. In March 2019, Abbott announced new data from its MOMENTUM 3 clinical study, the largest randomized controlled trial to assess outcomes in patients receiving a heart pump to treat advanced heart failure, which demonstrated HeartMate 3 improved survival and clinical outcomes in this patient population. Growth in Structural Heart was broad-based across several areas of the business, including MitraClip ® , Abbotts market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (MR), a leaky heart valve. During the quarter, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for a new, expanded indication for MitraClip to treat clinically significant secondary MR as a result of underlying heart failure. This new indication expands the number of people with MR that can be treated with the MitraClip device. In Vascular, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, revenues were basically flat as the 1.6 percent increase in coronary and endovascular product sales, which includes drug-eluting stents, balloon catheters, guidewires, vascular imaging/diagnostics products, vessel closure, carotid and other coronary and peripheral products, was offset primarily by a reduction in royalty revenue . In Rhythm Management, the 5.2 percent decline in revenues, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects an 11.6 percent decrease in U.S. sales partially offset by a 1.0 percent increase in international sales. The 7.1 percent decline in Neuromodulation sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, reflects a 9.6 percent decline in U.S. sales partially offset by international growth of 2.1 percent. The gross profit margin percentage was 51.6 percent for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 50.6 percent for the first quarter of 2018. The increase primarily reflects the favorable comparison versus the prior year from lower intangible amortization in 2019. Research and development expenses increased $83 million, or 14.2 percent, in the first quarter of 2019. In conjunction with the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies, Inc. in the first quarter of 2019, Abbott acquired an R&D asset valued at $102 million, which was immediately expensed. In the first quarter of 2018, Abbott acquired an R&D asset valued at $25 million, which was immediately expensed. The 2019 increase in R&D expense was also driven by higher R&D spending in various businesses, including Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, research and development expenditures totaled $261 million for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment, $142 million for the Diagnostic Products segment, $45 million for the Nutritional Products segment and $43 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first quarter of 2019 decreased 2.6 percent due primarily to lower acquisition-related integration costs and the favorable effect of foreign exchange on SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher selling and marketing costs to drive continued growth across various businesses. Restructuring Plans The results for the first three months of 2019 reflect charges under approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $35 million in the first three months of 2019 related to these initiatives, of which $16 million is recognized in Cost of products sold, $2 million is recognized in Research and development and $17 million is recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense. See Note 7 to the financial statements, Restructuring Plans, for additional information regarding these charges. Other (Income) Expense, net Other (income) expense, net increased $14 million in the first quarter of 2019 from $33 million of income in 2018 to $47 million in 2019. The increase in income in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to an increase in the income related to the non-service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost associated with Abbotts pension and postretirement benefit plans partially offset by the impairment of equity investments in 2019. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net decreased $51 million in the first quarter of 2019 due to a reduction in interest expense resulting from the repayment of debt in 2018, as well as the favorable impact of the euro debt refinancing in September 2018 partially offset by lower interest income due to lower cash balances. 21 Table of Contents Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2019, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include a $78 million reduction to the transition tax related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) and approximately $65 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The $78 million reduction to the transition tax liability was the result of the issuance of final transition tax regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury in the quarter. This adjustment decreased the cumulative net tax expense related to the TCJA to $1.51 billion. In the first three months of 2018, taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately $65 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation and a $15 million adjustment to the transition tax liability for associated effects related to state tax. Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first three months of 2018 reflect the recognition of $9 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years which decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by $16 million. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbotts income tax filings. Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between $185 million and $430 million, including cash adjustments, within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters. In the U.S., Abbotts federal income tax returns through 2016 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2014 and the former St. Jude Medical consolidated group which are settled through 2013. Liquidity and Capital Resources March 31, 2019 Compared with December 31, 2018 The reduction of cash and cash equivalents from $3.8 billion at December 31, 2018 to $3.0 billion at March 31, 2019 primarily reflects repayment of $500 million of debt, the payment of dividends and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash generated from operations in the first three months of 2019. Working capital was $5.3 billion at March 31, 2019 and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2018. The $300 million decrease in working capital in 2019 primarily reflects the decrease in cash partially offset by an increase in inventory and accounts receivable. In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first three months of 2019 totaled $712 million, a decrease of $396 million over the prior year due primarily to the timing of $313 million of pension contributions in 2019 and an increased investment in working capital partially offset by higher operating earnings. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first three months of 2019 was a use of $483 million and includes $313 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of approximately $185 million. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first three months of 2018 was a use of $182 million and includes the impact of approximately $220 million of cash taxes paid. Other, net in Net cash from operating activities for the first three months of 2018 also includes $14 million of pension contributions as a pension contribution of $270 million was made in December 2017. On February 16, 2018, the board of directors authorized the early redemption of up to $5 billion of outstanding long-term notes. Redemptions under this authorization total $4.3 billion, including the redemption of the $500 million outstanding principal amount of the 2.80% Notes due 2020 on February 24, 2019. Approximately $700 million of the $5 billion debt redemption authorization remains available. At March 31, 2019, Abbotts long-term debt rating was BBB+ by Standard & Poors Corporation and Baa1 by Moodys Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating. Abbott has readily available financial resources, including lines of credit of $5.0 billion which expire in 2023. In September 2014, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of Abbotts common shares from time to time. Under the program authorized in 2014, Abbott repurchased 36.2 million shares at a cost of $1.7 billion in 2015, 10.4 million shares at a cost of $408 million in 2016 and 1.9 million shares at a cost of $130 million in 2018 for a total of approximately $2.2 billion. On April 27, 2016, the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to $3 billion. No shares have been issued under this authorization. In the first quarter of 2019, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of approximately 14 percent over the $0.28 per share dividend declared in the first quarter of 2018. 22 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments  Credit Losses which changes the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. The new standard will be effective for Abbott at the beginning of 2020, with early adoption permitted. Abbott is currently assessing the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. Lease Accounting Standard In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases , which requires lessees to measure and recognize a lease asset and liability on the balance sheet for most leases, including operating leases. Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and applied the standards transition provisions as of January 1, 2019. As a result, no changes were made to the December 31, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Abbott elected to apply the package of practical expedients related to transition. These practical expedients allowed Abbott to carry forward its historical assessments of whether any existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for each lease existing at January 1, 2019, and whether any initial direct costs for such leases qualified for capitalization. The new lease accounting standard does not have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings but does have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of approximately $850 million of new right of use (ROU) assets and additional liabilities for operating leases on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2019. Legislative Issues Abbotts primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for health care products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott, including those made in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbotts operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 23 Table of Contents PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Executive Officer, Miles D. White, and Chief Financial Officer, Brian B. Yoor, evaluated the effectiveness of Abbott Laboratories disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that Abbott Laboratories disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information Abbott is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Abbott in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Abbotts management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. During the quarter ended March 31, 2019, there were no changes in Abbotts internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Abbotts internal control over financial reporting.
