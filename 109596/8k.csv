As we look ahead to a softer second-half revenue outlook, we remain focused on strong gross margin execution and disciplined cost management.”** The Company is identifying opportunities to deliver up to $2 billion in cumulative cost savings over the next three years.

REPORTS FISCAL 2024 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS BEAVERTON, Ore., Dec. 21, 2023 — NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported fiscal 2024 financial results for its second quarter ended November 30, 2023. • Second quarter revenues were $13.4 billion, up 1 percent on a reported basis compared to the prior year and down 1 percent on a currency-neutral basis* • NIKE Direct revenues were $5.7 billion, up 6 percent on a reported basis and up 4 percent on a currency-neutral basis • NIKE Brand Digital sales increased 4 percent on a reported basis and 1 percent on a currency-neutral basis • Wholesale revenues were $7.1 billion, down 2 percent on a reported basis and down 3 percent on a currency-neutral basis • Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 44.6 percent • Diluted earnings per share was $1.03 for the second quarter, up 21 percent • NIKE, Inc. is announcing an enterprise initiative to accelerate future growth while building a faster, more efficient Nike ** “Our Q2 results demonstrated how we are getting back on our front foot in our key areas of innovation and growth,” said John Donahoe, President & CEO, NIKE, Inc. “This quarter showed strong execution by our team as we focus on our winning formula of innovative product, distinctive storytelling and differentiated marketplace experiences.”** Matthew Friend, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, NIKE, Inc. said, “NIKE’s second-quarter financial performance was a turning point in driving more profitable growth. As we look ahead to a softer second-half revenue outlook, we remain focused on strong gross margin execution and disciplined cost management.”** The Company is identifying opportunities to deliver up to $2 billion in cumulative cost savings over the next three years. Areas of potential savings include simplifying our product assortment, increasing automation and use of technology, streamlining our organization, and leveraging our scale to drive greater efficiency.** A majority of these savings will be invested to fuel future growth, accelerate innovation at speed and scale, and drive greater long-term profitability.** As part of this commitment, the Company is taking steps to streamline the organization, which is expected to result in pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $400 million to $450 million that will largely be recognized in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, primarily associated with employee severance costs. Revised guidance will be provided on the conference call.** “We see an outstanding opportunity to drive long-term profitable growth,” said Donahoe. “Today we are embracing a company-wide journey to invest in our areas of greatest potential, increase the pace of our innovation, and accelerate our agility and responsiveness.”** Second Quarter Income Statement Review • Revenues for NIKE, Inc. increased 1 percent to $13.4 billion compared to the prior year and decreased 1 percent on a currency-neutral basis. ◦ Revenues for the NIKE Brand were $12.9 billion, up 1 percent compared to the prior year and flat on a currency-neutral basis, as currency-neutral growth in APLA and Greater China was offset by declines in North America and EMEA. ◦ Revenues for Converse were $519 million, down 11 percent compared to the prior year and down 13 percent on a currency-neutral basis, due to declines in North America and Europe, partially offset by growth in Asia. • Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 44.6 percent, primarily driven by strategic pricing actions and lower ocean freight rates, partially offset by unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates and higher product input costs. • Selling and administrative expense increased 1 percent to $4.1 billion. ◦ Demand creation expense was $1.1 billion, up 1 percent, reflecting an increase in marketing expense. ◦ Operating overhead expense was $3.0 billion, flat compared to the prior year as increases in NIKE Direct variable costs were offset by lower technology spend and wage-related expenses. • The effective tax rate was 17.9 percent compared to 19.3 percent for the same period last year. • Net income was $1.6 billion, up 19 percent, and Diluted earnings per share was $1.03, increasing 21 percent. November 30, 2023 Balance Sheet Review • Inventories for NIKE, Inc. were $8.0 billion, down 14 percent compared to the prior year, reflecting a decrease in units. • Cash and equivalents and short-term investments were $9.9 billion, down approximately $0.7 billion from last year, as cash generated by operations was more than offset by share repurchases, cash dividends, capital expenditures and bond repayment. Shareholder Returns NIKE continues to have a strong track record of investing to fuel growth and consistently increasing returns to shareholders, including 22 consecutive years of increasing dividend payouts. In the second quarter, NIKE returned approximately $1.7 billion to shareholders, including: • Dividends of $523 million, up 9 percent from the prior year. • Share repurchases of $1.2 billion, reflecting 11.9 million shares retired as part of the Company’s four-year, $18 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2022.

REPORTS FISCAL 2024 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS BEAVERTON, Ore., Sept. 28, 2023 — NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) today reported fiscal 2024 financial results for its first quarter ended August 31, 2023. • First quarter revenues were $12.9 billion, up 2 percent compared to prior year on a reported and currency-neutral basis* • NIKE Direct revenues were $5.4 billion, up 6 percent compared to prior year on a reported and currency-neutral basis with growth across all geographies • NIKE Brand Digital sales increased 2 percent on a reported and currency-neutral basis • Wholesale revenues were $7.0 billion, flat compared to prior year on a reported basis and up 1 percent on a currency-neutral basis • Gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 44.2 percent • Diluted earnings per share was $0.94 for the first quarter, up 1 percent “Q1 offered proof of what NIKE can deliver when we connect great innovation, great storytelling and great marketplace experiences to consumers,” said John Donahoe, President & CEO, NIKE, Inc. “Moving forward, we are laser-focused on scaling these successes with greater consistency and speed as we continue to integrate and streamline our business. This is how we’ll extend our leadership position and drive growth over the long-term.”** Matthew Friend, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, NIKE, Inc. said, “Our first-quarter results demonstrated the impact of staying on the offense over the past fiscal year. With a healthy marketplace and another quarter of brand and business momentum, we are strengthening our foundation for sustainable, profitable, long-term growth.”** First Quarter Income Statement Review • Revenues for NIKE, Inc. increased 2 percent on a reported and currency-neutral basis to $12.9 billion compared to the prior year. ◦ Revenues for the NIKE Brand were $12.4 billion, up 3 percent on a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by currency-neutral growth in EMEA, Greater China and APLA, partially offset by a decline in North America. ◦ Revenues for Converse were $588 million, down 9 percent on a reported and currency-neutral basis, due to a decline in North America, partially offset by growth in Asia. • Gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 44.2 percent, primarily driven by higher product costs and unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, largely offset by strategic pricing actions. • Selling and administrative expense increased 5 percent to $4.1 billion. ◦ Demand creation expense was $1.1 billion, up 13 percent, primarily due to advertising and marketing expense. ◦ Operating overhead expense increased 2 percent to $3.0 billion, primarily due to wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct variable costs, partially offset by lower technology spend. • The effective tax rate was 12.0 percent compared to 19.7 percent for the same period last year primarily due to a one-time benefit provided by the recent delay of the effective date of U.S. foreign tax regulations. • Net income was $1.5 billion, down 1 percent, and Diluted earnings per share was $0.94, increasing 1 percent. August 31, 2023 Balance Sheet Review • Inventories for NIKE, Inc. were $8.7 billion, down 10 percent compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in units, partially offset by product mix and higher product input costs. • Cash and equivalents and short-term investments were $8.8 billion, down approximately $3.1 billion from last year, as cash generated by operations was more than offset by share repurchases, cash dividends and capital expenditures. Shareholder Returns NIKE continues to have a strong track record of investing to fuel growth and consistently increasing returns to shareholders, including 21 consecutive years of increasing dividend payouts. In the first quarter, NIKE returned approximately $1.7 billion to shareholders, including: • Dividends of $524 million, up 9 percent from the prior year. • Share repurchases of $1.1 billion, reflecting 10.5 million shares retired as part of the Company’s four-year, $18 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2022. As of August 31, 2023, a total of 54 million shares have been repurchased under the program for a total of approximately $5.9 billion.

On October 31, 2018, Praxair and Linde AG combined under the Company, as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination”).

In addition, the unaudited pro forma income statements do not intend to be a projection of the future operating results of the Company. The financial information is presented as if the Merger had been consummated on January 1, 2018 and combines the historical results of Praxair and Linde AG.

LINDE PLC By: /s/ Kelcey E. Hoyt Kelcey E. Hoyt Chief Accounting Officer Date: September 13, 2019 -;-EX-99.1:EX-99.1 2 exhibit991.htm EX-99.1 Exhibit Exhibit 99.1 Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income The Business Combination of Praxair and Linde AG was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations,” with Praxair representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. The information below is presented as if the Merger had been consummated on January 1, 2018 and combines the historical results of Praxair and Linde AG. The following Pro Forma Information was prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 of the SEC’s Regulation S-X and gives effect to the following adjustments: 1. The preliminary purchase accounting impacts of the Merger, including increased amortization expense on acquired intangible assets, increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment and lower interest expense due to revaluing existing debt to fair value; 2. Conversion to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"") from International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (""IASB""); 3. Accounting policy alignment; 4. The elimination of the impact of transactions between Praxair and Linde AG; 5. The elimination of the effect of events that are directly attributable to the Business Combination Agreement; and 6. The elimination of the effect of consummated and probable divestitures required as a condition of approval for the Merger. In preparing this pro forma information, the historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that are (i) directly attributable to the Business Combination and other transactions presented herein, such as the merger-related divestitures, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined entity’s consolidated results. Such Pro Forma Information is based on management's assumptions and is presented for comparative purposes only. It does not necessarily represent what the revenue or results of operations would have been if the business combination and merger-related divestitures had occurred as of the date indicated or what the results would be for any future periods. In addition, the Pro Forma Information does not include the impact of any revenue, cost or other operating synergies that may result from the Business Combination or any related restructuring costs. Events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g., inventory step-up costs, non-recurring income/charges) are excluded from the unaudited pro forma information. The pro forma adjustments included in this document are subject to modification depending on changes in the final fair value determination for assets acquired and liabilities assumed and additional information or analyses that may become available. The final allocation of the total purchase price will be determined after completing a thorough analysis of the fair value of Linde AG’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of October 31, 2018, the date when the Business Combination was completed. Increases or decreases in the fair values of the net assets as compared with the information shown in the Pro Forma Information may change the amount of the total purchase consideration allocated to goodwill and other assets and liabilities and may impact the combined group statements of income due to adjustments in amortization and depreciation of the adjusted assets and liabilities. The final adjustments may be materially different from the Pro Forma Information. LINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 2018 SUMMARY PRO FORMA AND ADJUSTED PRO FORMA INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Pro forma and adjusted pro forma amounts are Non-GAAP performance measures, which are intended to supplement investors' understanding of the company's financial information by providing measures which investors, financial analysts and management find useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. Items which the company does not believe to be indicative of on-going business performance are excluded from these calculations so that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis. Definitions of these Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures. See the ""PRO FORMA INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION"" and ""NON GAAP MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS"" sections for additional information relating to adjustments.

LINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES APPENDIX QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 PRO FORMA INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION (Millions of dollars, except per share data) (UNAUDITED) Pro forma information has been prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, assuming the Merger and merger-related divestitures had been in effect on January 1, 2018. The pro forma information includes pro forma adjustments to historical financial information, which are (i) directly attributable to the business combination and other transactions presented herein, such as the merger-related divestitures, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined entity’s consolidated results. The pro forma information is based on management's assumptions and is presented for comparative purposes only. It does not necessarily represent what the revenue or results of operations would have been if the business combination and merger-related divestitures had occurred on January 1, 2018. In addition, this information is not intended to be a projection of future operating results or financial position and does not reflect revenue, cost, or other operational synergies that might be achieved.

On October 31, 2018, Praxair and Linde AG combined under the Company, as contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination”). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, (i) Praxair became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company through the merger of Zamalight Subco, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of the Company, with and into Praxair (the “Merger”), and (ii) Linde AG became an indirect subsidiary of the Company through an exchange offer by the Company for each issued and outstanding bearer share of Linde AG (the “Exchange Offer”). Under the Exchange Offer, the Company exchanged each Linde AG tendered share for 1.540 ordinary shares of the Company. Each share of Praxair common stock was converted into 1.000 ordinary share of the Company. In connection with the Business Combination, the Company, Praxair and Linde AG also entered into various transactions to satisfy regulatory requirements, which included merger-related divestitures required by governmental regulatory authorities as a condition of approval for the Merger (""merger-related divestitures""). The following 2018 unaudited pro forma income statement information (""Pro Forma Information"") is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the Business Combination and other transactions presented herein, such as the merger-related divestitures, and includes certain adjustments as noted below. It has been prepared based upon currently available information and assumptions deemed appropriate by management and is not necessarily indicative of what the Company's results of operations actually would have been had the Merger been completed on January 1, 2018. In addition, the unaudited pro forma income statements do not intend to be a projection of the future operating results of the Company. The financial information is presented as if the Merger had been consummated on January 1, 2018 and combines the historical results of Praxair and Linde AG.

This financial information should be read in conjunction with the separate historical financial statements and accompanying notes contained in each of the Company's and Praxair's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the applicable periods filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Linde AG, as previously filed as Exhibit 99.3 to the Company’s Form 8-K reporting the completion of the Business Combination on October 31, 2018. ITEM 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits The following exhibit is furnished herewith pursuant to Item 7.01 hereof: Exhibit No. Description 99.1 2018 Linde plc Pro Forma Financial Information SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. LINDE PLC By: /s/ Kelcey E. Hoyt Kelcey E. Hoyt Chief Accounting Officer Date: September 13, 2019 ","EX-99.1:EX-99.1 2 exhibit991.htm EX-99.1 Exhibit Exhibit 99.1 Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income The Business Combination of Praxair and Linde AG was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification 805, “Business Combinations,” with Praxair representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. The information below is presented as if the Merger had been consummated on January 1, 2018 and combines the historical results of Praxair and Linde AG. The following Pro Forma Information was prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 of the SEC’s Regulation S-X and gives effect to the following adjustments: 1. The preliminary purchase accounting impacts of the Merger, including increased amortization expense on acquired intangible assets, increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment and lower interest expense due to revaluing existing debt to fair value; 2. Conversion to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"") from International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (""IASB""); 3. Accounting policy alignment; 4. The elimination of the impact of transactions between Praxair and Linde AG; 5. The elimination of the effect of events that are directly attributable to the Business Combination Agreement; and 6. The elimination of the effect of consummated and probable divestitures required as a condition of approval for the Merger. In preparing this pro forma information, the historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that are (i) directly attributable to the Business Combination and other transactions presented herein, such as the merger-related divestitures, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined entity’s consolidated results. Such Pro Forma Information is based on management's assumptions and is presented for comparative purposes only. It does not necessarily represent what the revenue or results of operations would have been if the business combination and merger-related divestitures had occurred as of the date indicated or what the results would be for any future periods. In addition, the Pro Forma Information does not include the impact of any revenue, cost or other operating synergies that may result from the Business Combination or any related restructuring costs. Events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g., inventory step-up costs, non-recurring income/charges) are excluded from the unaudited pro forma information. The pro forma adjustments included in this document are subject to modification depending on changes in the final fair value determination for assets acquired and liabilities assumed and additional information or analyses that may become available. The final allocation of the total purchase price will be determined after completing a thorough analysis of the fair value of Linde AG’s tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of October 31, 2018, the date when the Business Combination was completed. Increases or decreases in the fair values of the net assets as compared with the information shown in the Pro Forma Information may change the amount of the total purchase consideration allocated to goodwill and other assets and liabilities and may impact the combined group statements of income due to adjustments in amortization and depreciation of the adjusted assets and liabilities. The final adjustments may be materially different from the Pro Forma Information. LINDE PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 2018 SUMMARY PRO FORMA AND ADJUSTED PRO FORMA INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Pro forma and adjusted pro forma amounts are Non-GAAP performance measures, which are intended to supplement investors' understanding of the company's financial information by providing measures which investors, financial analysts and management find useful in evaluating the company's operating performance.

FX +4% versus prior year and +5% sequentially ➢ Operating profit margin 9.3%, adjusted pro forma operating profit margin 18.4% ➢ EPS $0.94, adjusted pro forma EPS $1.83 ➢ Raised full-year adjusted pro forma EPS guidance to $6.95 - $7.18* ➢ Increased sale of gas backlog to $4.7 billion Guildford, UK, August 5, 2019 – Linde plc (NYSE: LIN; FWB: LIN) today reported second-quarter income from continuing operations of $513 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.94. Excluding Linde AG purchase accounting impacts and other charges, adjusted pro forma income from continuing operations was $1,000 million, up 11% versus prior year adjusted pro forma and 8% sequentially. Adjusted pro forma earnings per share was $1.83, 12% above the prior year and 8% sequentially. Linde’s sales for the second quarter were $7,204 million. Pro forma sales were $7,179 million, in line with the prior year. Excluding unfavorable currency translation effects, sales increased 4% driven by volume and price each growing 2%. Volume growth was evenly split between base business and project startups while price improved across all geographic segments. Sales sequentially increased 4% driven by 4% higher volumes and 1% price, partially offset by 1% currency headwind. Second quarter reported operating profit of $669 million was 3% below the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact of purchase accounting. On an adjusted pro forma basis, operating profit of $1,319 million was 6% above prior year or 10% when excluding unfavorable currency. During the second quarter, the company paid $474 million of dividends and repurchased $498 million of stock, net of issuance. Commenting on the financial results, Chief Executive Officer Steve Angel said, “Linde employees delivered strong financial results by improving operating profit margins to drive 12% EPS growth and securing a record project backlog of $4.7 billion. As we look towards the remainder of the year, I’m confident we will deliver on our commitments to create shareholder value irrespective of the economic environment.” For full-year 2019, Linde expects adjusted pro forma diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.95 to $7.18 which represents an increase of 12% to 16% versus prior year. This range includes an estimated currency headwind of 3%. Following is additional detail on second quarter 2019 pro forma results for each segment. Americas sales of $2,779 million were 4% higher versus prior-year quarter and 3% higher sequentially. Compared with the first quarter of 2019, volume and price increased 3% and 1% respectively, while currency was unfavorable by 1%. Operating profit of $646 million was 23.2% of sales. APAC (Asia Pacific) sales of $1,488 million decreased 2% from prior year but increased 4% sequentially. Excluding negative currency, sales grew 4% versus the prior year and 5% sequentially. Sequentially, price improved 1% and volumes increased 4% primarily driven by seasonal effects in Australia and China. Operating profit of $304 million was 20.4% of sales. EMEA (Europe, Middle East & Africa) sales of $1,673 million were up 1% versus both the prior year and sequentially excluding unfavorable currency. Compared with the first quarter of 2019, volume increased 1% and price was flat. Operating profit of $332 million was 19.8% of sales. Linde Engineering sales were $752 million and operating profit was $99 million or 13.2% of sales. Operating profit grew 27% versus prior year and sequentially due to strong project execution and cost management.

For more information about the company, please visit www.linde.com Proforma sales and adjusted operating profit and earnings per share are non-GAAP measures prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 and includes certain non-GAAP adjustments. See pages 9 to 15 for reconciliations. See the attachments for a summary of pro forma, adjusted pro forma and non-GAAP reconciliations and calculations. Adjusted amounts, EBITDA, free cash flow and net debt are non-GAAP measures. *Note: We are providing adjusted pro forma earnings per share (“EPS”) guidance for 2019. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (a GAAP measure) but excludes the impact of certain items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. At this time, we cannot provide a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP adjusted pro forma EPS guidance and the corresponding GAAP EPS measure for 2019 without unreasonable effort such as (1) the impact of anticipated asset divestitures and (2) purchase accounting adjustments related to the business combination between Praxair and Linde AG. As such, these variables result in an EPS GAAP range that we believe is too large and variable to be meaningful.

The pro forma information has been prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, assuming the Merger and merger-related divestitures had been consummated on January 1, 2017. In preparing this pro forma information, the historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that are (i) directly attributable to the Business Combination and other transactions presented herein, such as the merger-related divestitures, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined entity’s consolidated results. The pro forma information is based on management's assumptions and is presented for illustrative purposes and does not purport to represent what the results of operations would actually have been if the Business Combination and merger-related divestitures had occurred as of the dates indicated or what the results would be for any future periods. Also, the pro forma information does not include the impact of any revenue, cost or other operating synergies that may result from the Business Combination or any related restructuring costs. The unaudited pro forma income statement has been presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what Linde plc's results of operation actually would have been had the Merger been completed on January 1, 2017. In addition, the unaudited pro forma income statement does not purport to project the future operating results of the company.

FX +4% versus prior year and +5% sequentially ➢ Operating profit margin 9.3%, adjusted pro forma operating profit margin 18.4% ➢ EPS $0.94, adjusted pro forma EPS $1.83 ➢ Raised full-year adjusted pro forma EPS guidance to $6.95 - $7.18* ➢ Increased sale of gas backlog to $4.7 billion Guildford, UK, August 5, 2019 – Linde plc (NYSE: LIN; FWB: LIN) today reported second-quarter income from continuing operations of $513 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.94. Excluding Linde AG purchase accounting impacts and other charges, adjusted pro forma income from continuing operations was $1,000 million, up 11% versus prior year adjusted pro forma and 8% sequentially. Adjusted pro forma earnings per share was $1.83, 12% above the prior year and 8% sequentially. Linde’s sales for the second quarter were $7,204 million. Pro forma sales were $7,179 million, in line with the prior year. Excluding unfavorable currency translation effects, sales increased 4% driven by volume and price each growing 2%. Volume growth was evenly split between base business and project startups while price improved across all geographic segments. Sales sequentially increased 4% driven by 4% higher volumes and 1% price, partially offset by 1% currency headwind. Second quarter reported operating profit of $669 million was 3% below the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the impact of purchase accounting. On an adjusted pro forma basis, operating profit of $1,319 million was 6% above prior year or 10% when excluding unfavorable currency. During the second quarter, the company paid $474 million of dividends and repurchased $498 million of stock, net of issuance. Commenting on the financial results, Chief Executive Officer Steve Angel said, “Linde employees delivered strong financial results by improving operating profit margins to drive 12% EPS growth and securing a record project backlog of $4.7 billion. As we look towards the remainder of the year, I’m confident we will deliver on our commitments to create shareholder value irrespective of the economic environment.” For full-year 2019, Linde expects adjusted pro forma diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.95 to $7.18 which represents an increase of 12% to 16% versus prior year. This range includes an estimated currency headwind of 3%. Following is additional detail on second quarter 2019 pro forma results for each segment. Americas sales of $2,779 million were 4% higher versus prior-year quarter and 3% higher sequentially. Compared with the first quarter of 2019, volume and price increased 3% and 1% respectively, while currency was unfavorable by 1%. Operating profit of $646 million was 23.2% of sales. APAC (Asia Pacific) sales of $1,488 million decreased 2% from prior year but increased 4% sequentially. Excluding negative currency, sales grew 4% versus the prior year and 5% sequentially. Sequentially, price improved 1% and volumes increased 4% primarily driven by seasonal effects in Australia and China. Operating profit of $304 million was 20.4% of sales. EMEA (Europe, Middle East & Africa) sales of $1,673 million were up 1% versus both the prior year and sequentially excluding unfavorable currency. Compared with the first quarter of 2019, volume increased 1% and price was flat. Operating profit of $332 million was 19.8% of sales. Linde Engineering sales were $752 million and operating profit was $99 million or 13.2% of sales. Operating profit grew 27% versus prior year and sequentially due to strong project execution and cost management.

For more information about the company, please visit www.linde.com Proforma sales and adjusted operating profit and earnings per share are non-GAAP measures prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 and includes certain non-GAAP adjustments. See pages 9 to 15 for reconciliations. See the attachments for a summary of pro forma, adjusted pro forma and non-GAAP reconciliations and calculations. Adjusted amounts, EBITDA, free cash flow and net debt are non-GAAP measures. *Note: We are providing adjusted pro forma earnings per share (“EPS”) guidance for 2019. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (a GAAP measure) but excludes the impact of certain items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. At this time, we cannot provide a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP adjusted pro forma EPS guidance and the corresponding GAAP EPS measure for 2019 without unreasonable effort such as (1) the impact of anticipated asset divestitures and (2) purchase accounting adjustments related to the business combination between Praxair and Linde AG. As such, these variables result in an EPS GAAP range that we believe is too large and variable to be meaningful.

Praxair, Inc. was the accounting acquirer and as a result historical periods prior to the merger date solely reflect the results of Praxair, Inc. The following adjusted pro forma adjusted amounts are Non-GAAP measures and are intended to supplement investors' understanding of the company's financial statements by providing measures which investors, financial analysts and management use to help evaluate the company's operating performance. Items which the company does not believe to be indicative of on-going business trends are excluded from these calculations so that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis. Definitions of these Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures.

The pro forma information has been prepared on a basis consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, assuming the Merger and merger-related divestitures had been consummated on January 1, 2017. In preparing this pro forma information, the historical financial information has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that are (i) directly attributable to the Business Combination and other transactions presented herein, such as the merger-related divestitures, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined entity’s consolidated results. The pro forma information is based on management's assumptions and is presented for illustrative purposes and does not purport to represent what the results of operations would actually have been if the Business Combination and merger-related divestitures had occurred as of the dates indicated or what the results would be for any future periods. Also, the pro forma information does not include the impact of any revenue, cost or other operating synergies that may result from the Business Combination or any related restructuring costs.
